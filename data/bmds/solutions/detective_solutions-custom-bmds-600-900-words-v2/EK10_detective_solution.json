    "full_text": "The detective story \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg,\" authored by Unknown, unfolds through the perspective of Norris, a man weary of his life amid the exhausting chaos of Johannesburg's Stock Exchange. At the story’s outset, Norris expresses a desperate longing for a holiday far from the relentless market hustle, social superficialities, and financial anxieties that dominate his days. The slump he anticipates in the market urges him toward the open veld, where he hopes to find respite and perhaps save money by escaping the unstable economic climate.\n\nDuring a conversation with three friends at a marketplace, Norris reveals his plan to journey to Manicaland. The topic of Barrington emerges unexpectedly when Teddy Isaacs, a newcomer to Johannesburg, suggests that Norris bring Barrington back with him. To Isaacs, Barrington is merely a name—a man who vanished a year earlier in the wilderness on the eastern borders of Mashonaland—but to Norris and the others, Barrington carries a heavier, charged significance. The story behind Barrington’s disappearance is linked deeply with a bitter rivalry between him and Norris, rooted in their ostrich-farming past near Port Elizabeth in the Cape Colony.\n\nThe narrative reveals that Norris and Barrington once farmed ostriches side by side, but their relationship was strained and marked by personal jealousy and conflict. Norris was married, whereas Barrington was not, a detail that contributed to the tension between them. When the ostrich industry declined, Norris’s fortunes deteriorated, and he drifted north to Johannesburg, just as Barrington had done earlier. In Johannesburg, the rivalry manifested through their dealings on the Stock Exchange, described figuratively as a duel fought not with weapons but with shares. Barrington proved the more calculating and successful of the two, resulting in Norris’s continued misfortunes.\n\nBarrington had disappeared roughly a year prior while on an expedition northward toward the Zambesi River, lost somewhere on the eastern borders of Mashonaland. With a mixture of hope and determination, Norris outfitted himself for an expedition to find Barrington. He prepared extensively: he purchased a buck-wagon with a canvas tent, stocked provisions for six months, acquired oxen and horses, and recruited a small party including a Griqua wagon-driver and Matabele boys eager to return to their homeland. His journey took him northeast from Johannesburg to Makoni’s town near the Zimbabwe ruins.\n\nAt Makoni’s town, Norris secured the guidance of a Ma-ongwi boy, who possessed local knowledge and had previously traveled the Mashonaland plateau, including twice having camped where Norris planned to stay. The boy's familiarity with the territory and Barrington’s tracks was invaluable. Encouragingly, the boy confirmed that Barrington’s wagon-track led to their campsite—a discovery that gave Norris both a feeling of connection to the missing man and a certain ironic satisfaction at standing in Barrington’s \"shoes.\"\n\nNorris settled at the camp for two weeks. During his stay, he hunted local game—blue wildebeests, koodoos, elands, gems-bok, and attempted to bag a wart-hog boar—and adapted to the wild rhythm of the land. One morning, while surveying the surroundings, he spotted a herd of buffalo approaching. Seizing the opportunity, Norris armed himself and carefully stalked the herd, shooting a bull buffalo. However, to his dismay, the bull was wounded but not fatally. A vigorous chase ensued, taking Norris through the African veld, across a stream, and ultimately to a great granite cone he had used as a landmark during his stay.\n\nRiding into the granite amphitheater formed at the base of the cone, Norris was struck by the stunning beauty and intense heat of the place. The cliffs, festooned with wild flowers in riotous bloom, formed a natural enclosure radiating vivid color and searing sunlight, which contrasted with the eerie silence that filled the hollow. This silence soon unsettled Norris. Despite a strong, dry thirst and the oppressive midday heat, he forced himself to continue his exploration.\n\nWhile moving cautiously through the encampment, Norris notices peculiar objects lying by the path: a large, mold-covered item resembling a melon and, more disturbingly, a broken rifle. The rifle was in a damaged state—twisted barrel, lock removed, unmistakable marks of human teeth, and faint impressions of fingers pressing hard upon the wood. The sight awakens a buried memory in Norris, reminiscent of the “naked footprint in the sand” from Robinson Crusoe, symbolizing a lost trail or mysterious disappearance.\n\nHis unease intensifies as the natural foliage around him seems to stir despite the absence of wind, creating an uncanny atmosphere. Norris abruptly shifts focus to the mold-covered object, cleaning patches with his knife and discovering it to be hollow yet packed with hardened mud that bore finger impressions. This strange artifact, coupled with the mutilated rifle, suggests a human presence and struggle—possibly linked to Barrington’s fate.\n\nOvercome momentarily by tension and isolation, Norris erupts into uncontrollable laughter and a wild, frantic dance amidst the flowers, the sun, and the granite walls, as if battling his own fear and loneliness. This hysterical outburst makes the surrounding vegetation ripple almost miraculously, mirroring his rapid, unsettling emotions.\n\nJust as his laughter subsides, Norris spots a group of baboons leaping across a clean granite patch above his horse’s head—a sudden wildlife intrusion that punctuates the eerie and charged atmosphere of the scene.\n\nIn summary, \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg\" encapsulates Norris’s journey in search of Barrington, weaving together themes of rivalry, mystery, isolation, and the overpowering force of the African wilderness. Norris’s expedition reveals poignant clues about Barrington’s disappearance but also plunges him into a surreal confrontation with nature and his own psyche. His discovery of Barrington’s last known campsite, the broken rifle, and the strange mud-covered object suggests that Barrington’s fate remains shrouded in mystery, promising further revelation or danger.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish whether a crime has actually been committed  \n • Barrington has vanished for twelve months and is almost certainly dead.  \n • A smashed rifle, unmistakable tooth-marks in the steel and wood, and a mysterious hollow “melon” packed with mud are the only relics of him that Norris finds.  \n • Those relics show deliberate human interference (the lock has been taken out, the barrel has been twisted, the wooden stock bears finger pressure) and are not compatible with a simple accident or a purely animal attack.  \n • Therefore Barrington’s disappearance must be treated as homicide rather than misadventure.\n\n2. List everybody who could conceivably have caused Barrington’s death  \n • Edgar Norris – life-long rival, ruined financially by Barrington, now following his trail.  \n • Teddy Isaacs – the Johannesburg acquaintance who casually mentions Barrington.  \n • The Griqua driver and three Matabele boys – hired crew.  \n • The Ma-ongwi guide – joins the party at Makoni’s town.  \n • Unknown natives or hunters met on the veld.  \n • Wild animals (buffalo, baboons, hyænas) – always present but without a human motive.  \n • Barrington himself (suicide or deliberate disappearance).\n\n3. Motive analysis  \n • Norris: concrete motive – long-standing jealousy (Barrington outshone him in ostrich-breeding, in the Stock-Exchange duel, and even socially because Barrington was the unattached “eligible” man while Norris was unhappily married). Every reverse in Norris’s life is explicitly linked to Barrington’s success.  \n • Isaacs: none – he had never met Barrington.  \n • Wagon crew & guide: none – they never knew Barrington and are paid servants.  \n • Unknown natives/hunters: no personal motive stated.  \n • Wild animals: no conscious motive.  \n • Barrington himself: no reason to destroy his own rifle and vanish voluntarily; he was doing well.\n\n4. Opportunity analysis  \n • Only one man is demonstrably on Barrington’s actual route at the correct time: Norris.  \n • The wagon crew, the guide, and Isaacs are hundreds of miles away when Barrington vanishes.  \n • Animals obviously share the veld with Barrington, but the rifle shows INTENTIONAL human mutilation (lock removed, barrel bent – neither a baboon nor a buffalo removes a lock-plate).\n\n5. Physical clues and behaviour  \n a) A rifle barrel cannot be twisted without tools or great strength; Norris was once an ostrich-farmer accustomed to heavy manual work.  \n b) The lock is missing.  \n  – Removing the lock prevents a bullet fired from that weapon being matched later to a corpse, an unmistakably “forensic” precaution.  \n  – Only a man worried about evidence would do that.  \n c) Teeth-marks are on the barrel BUT also “faint finger impressions” are embedded in the wood, as though someone gripped the stock in a paroxysm of rage.  \n d) The “melon” proves hollow, filled with hardened mud bearing finger prints pressed into the clay: a crude attempt to form a head-sized weight – exactly the sort of thing an amateur would devise to sink a body in a water-hole.  \n e) Norris’s mental breakdown – the hysterical laughter and dance – is not fear of animals but a release of terror at finding the damning relics he thought he had hidden.  \n f) He recognises the granite cone instantly and rides straight toward it, without scouting. That betrays previous knowledge.  \n g) In conversation back in Johannesburg Norris never denies Isaacs’s “Bring Barrington back!” joke; he merely says “I will try.” A slip showing he already knows Barrington cannot return alive.\n\n6. Alibis  \n • None exist for Norris; after Barrington left Johannesburg the year before, Norris’s movements are unaccounted for.  \n • Isaacs can be placed in Johannesburg for the entire year.  \n • The driver, boys, and guide have no contact with Barrington until they march north with Norris many months later.\n\n7. Re-examining the animal theory  \n • A buffalo might gore a hunter, but it neither twists a rifle-barrel lengthwise nor removes a lock-plate.  \n • A troop of baboons will bite wooden stocks; they will not unscrew screws or conceal the lock.  \n Conclusion: animal activity can explain post-mortem damage but not the primary sabotage of the firearm.\n\n8. Logical synthesis  \n A single person with (i) a strong motive, (ii) opportunity, (iii) fore-knowledge of Barrington’s route, and (iv) a demonstrated familiarity with the very spot where the relics are found is Edgar Norris.  \n Therefore Norris is not a bereaved “searcher”; he is the killer revisiting the crime scene to convince himself the body is still undiscovered. The discoveries that overwhelm him with hysteria are, in truth, his own clumsy attempts at concealment twelve months earlier.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEdgar Norris, Teddy Isaacs, Griqua wagon-driver, three Matabele boys, Ma-ongwi guide, unknown natives, wild animals, Geoffrey Barrington himself\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nEdgar Norris\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• July of the previous year: Geoffrey Barrington, having prospered on the Johannesburg Exchange, outfits a wagon for a prospecting trip toward the Zambesi.  \n• Unknown to his companions, his enemy Edgar Norris follows him out of the Rand in a light Cape-cart.  \n• Near the granite cone, Norris overtakes Barrington, quarrels, wrenches the rifle from him, twists the barrel so it cannot be used, removes the lock (to prevent ballistics proof), and kills him – almost certainly with Barrington’s own rifle-butt or with a hunting-knife.  \n• He drags the body to a deep pool beside the stream, binds a hastily-made mud weight (the “melon”) to it, and sinks it. He hides the smashed rifle in scrub and rides south.  \n• Hyænas/baboons later pull the skeleton from the water, gnaw the shattered weapon, and leave scattered fragments on the granite platform.  \n• Twelve months later, with the market slumping and fearing that native travellers may stumble on the bones, Norris announces a “holiday,” raises capital by mortgaging his holdings, and recreates the journey – ostensibly to “find Barrington.”  \n• He steers directly to the old spot, confirms that only worthless relics remain, and is suddenly overwhelmed by the horror of what he did, the silence, and the heat; hysteria erupts in the grotesque dance that the story records.  \n• Baboons startled by his screams bound across the granite rim, bringing the episode (and the tale as we have it) to its breaking point. Barrington will “return to Johannesburg” only as a name on a death-certificate, while his murderer rides back southward a haunted man.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nTeddy Isaacs – never left Johannesburg, never met Barrington, no motive.  \nGriqua driver & Matabele boys – hired months after Barrington disappeared; they were hundreds of miles away at the critical time.  \nMa-ongwi guide – joins Norris only at Makoni’s and first sees the site with him.  \nUnknown natives – no evidence of hostility, no trace of them at the scene, no motive.  \nWild animals – could dismember or scatter a corpse but cannot sabotage a rifle by removing the lock.  \nBarrington himself – no sign of voluntary absence; everything points to his violent death.  \nTherefore all others are cleared, leaving Edgar Norris as the sole and therefore proven culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "text": "Norris wanted a holiday. He stood in the marketplace looking southwards to the chimney-stacks, and dilating upon the subject to three of his friends. He was sick of the Stock Exchange, the men, the women, the drinks, the dances—everything. He was as indifferent to the price of shares as to the rise and fall of the quicksilver in his barometer; he neither desired to go in on the ground floor nor to come out in the attics. He simply wanted to get clean away. Besides he foresaw a slump, and he would be actually saving money on the veld. At this point Teddy Isaacs strolled up and interrupted the oration.\n\"Where are you off to, then?\"\n\"Manicaland,\" answered Norris.\n\"Oh! You had better bring Barrington back.\"\nTeddy Isaacs was a fresh comer to the Rand, and knew no better. Barrington meant to him nothing more than the name of a man who had been lost twelve months before on the eastern borders of Mashonaland. But he saw three pairs of eyebrows lift simultaneously, and heard three simultaneous outbursts on the latest Uitlander grievance. However, Norris answered him quietly enough.\n\"Yes, if I come across Barrington, I'll bring him back.\" He nodded his head once or twice and smiled. \"You may make sure of that,\" he added, and turned away from the group.\nIsaacs gathered that there had been trouble between Barrington and Morris, and applied to his companions for information. The commencement of the trouble, he was told, dated back to the time when the two men were ostrich-farming side by side, close to Port Elizabeth in the Cape Colony. Norris owned a wife; Barrington did not. The story was sufficiently ugly as Johannesburg was accustomed to relate it, but upon this occasion Teddy Isaacs was allowed to infer the details. He was merely put in possession of the more immediate facts. Barrington had left the Cape Colony in a hurry, and coming north to the Transvaal when Johannesburg was as yet in its brief infancy, had prospered exceedingly. Meanwhile, Norris, as the ostrich industry declined, had gone from worse to worse, and finally he too drifted to Johannesburg with the rest of the flotsam of South Africa. He came to the town alone, and met Barrington one morning eye to eye on the Stock Exchange. A certain amount of natural disappointment was expressed when the pair were seen to separate without hostilities; but it was subsequently remarked that they were fighting out their duel, though not in the conventional way. They fought with shares, and Barrington won. He had the clearer head, and besides, Norris didn't need much ruining; Barrington could see to that in his spare time. It was, in fact, as though Norris stood up with a derringer to face a machine gun. His turn, however, had come after Barrington's disappearance, and he was now able to contemplate an expedition into Manicaland without reckoning up his pass-book.\nHe bought a buck-wagon with a tent covering over the hinder part, provisions sufficient for six months, a span of oxen, a couple of horses salted for the thickhead sickness, hired a Griqua lad as wagon-driver, and half a dozen Matabele boys who were waiting for a chance to return, and started northeastward.\nFrom Johannesburg he travelled to Makoni's town, near the Zimbabwe ruins, and with half a dozen brass rings and an empty cartridge case hired a Ma-ongwi boy, who had been up to the Mashonaland plateau before. The lad guided him to the head waters of the Inyazuri, and there Norris fenced in his camp, in a grass country fairly wooded, and studded with gigantic blocks of granite.\nThe Ma-ongwi boy chose the site, fifty yards west of an ant-heap, and about a quarter of a mile from a forest of machabel. He had camped on the spot before, he said.\n\"When?\" asked Norris.\n\"Twice,\" replied the boy. \"Three years ago and last year.\"\n\"Last year?\" Norris looked up with a start of surprise. \"You were up here last year?\"\n\"Yes!\"\nFor a moment or two Norris puffed at his pipe, then he asked slowly—\n\"Who with?\"\n\"Mr. Barrington,\" the boy told him, and added, \"It is his wagon-track which we have been following.\"\nNorris rose from the ground, and walked straight ahead for the distance of a hundred yards until he reached a jasmine bush, which stood in a bee-line with the opening of his camp fence. Thence he moved round in a semicircle until he came upon a wagon-track in the rear of the camp, and, after pausing there, he went forward again, and completed the circle. He returned to his wagon chuckling. Barrington, he remembered, had been lost while travelling northwards to the Zambesie; but the track stopped here. There was not a trace of it to the north or the east or the west. It was evident that the boy had chosen Barrington's last camping-ground as the site for his own, and he discovered a comforting irony in the fact. He felt that he was standing in Barrington's shoes.\nThat night, as he was smoking by the fire, he called out to the\nMa-ongwi boy. The lad came forward from his hut behind the wagon.\n\n\"Tell me how you lost him,\" said Norris.\n\"He rode that way alone after a sable antelope.\" The boy pointed an arm to the southwest. \"The beast was wounded, and we followed its blood-spoor. We found Mr. Barrington's horse gored by the antelope's horns. He himself had gone forward on foot. We tracked him to a little stream, but the opposite bank was trampled, and we lost all sign of him.\" This is what the boy said though his language is translated.\nNorris remained upon this encampment for a fortnight. Blue wildebeests, koodoos, elands, and gems-bok were plentiful, and once he got a shot at a wart-hog boar. At the end of the fortnight he walked round the ant-heap early one morning, and of a sudden plumped down full length in the grass. Straight in front of him he saw a herd of buffaloes moving in his direction down a glade of the forest a quarter of a mile away. Norris cast a glance backwards; the camp was hidden from the herd by the intervening ant-heap. He looked again towards the forest; the buffaloes advanced slowly, pasturing as they moved. Norris crawled behind the ant-heap on his hands and knees, ran thence into the camp, buckled on a belt of cartridges, snatched up a 450-bore Metford rifle, and got back to his position just as the first of the herd stepped into the open. It turned to the right along the edge of the wood, and the others followed in file. Norris wriggled forward through the grass, and selecting a fat bull in the centre of the line, aimed behind its shoulder and fired. The herd stampeded into the forest, the bull fell in its tracks.\nNorris sprang forward with a shout; but he had not run more than thirty yards before the bull began to kick. It kneeled upon its forelegs, rose thence on to its hind legs, and finally stood up. Norris guessed what had happened. He had hit the bull in the neck instead of behind the shoulders, and had broken no bones. He fired his second barrel as the brute streamed away in an oblique line southeastwards from the wood, and missed. Then he ran back to camp, slapped a bridle on to his swiftest horse, and without waiting to saddle it, sprang on its back and galloped in pursuit. He rode as it were along the base of a triangle, whereas the bull galloped from the apex, and since his breakfast was getting hot behind him, he wished to make that triangle an isosceles. So he jammed his heels into his horse's ribs, and was fast drawing within easy range, when the buffalo got his wind and swerved on the instant into a diagonal course due southwest.\nThe manoeuvre left Norris directly behind his quarry, and with a long, stern chase in prospect. However, his blood was up, and he held on to wear the beast down. He forgot his breakfast; he took no more than a casual notice of the direction he was following; he simply braced his knees in a closer grip, while the distorted shadows of himself and the horse lengthened and thinned along the ground as the sun rose over his right shoulder.\nSuddenly the buffalo disappeared in a dip of the veld, and a few moments later came again into view a good hundred yards further to the south. Norris pulled his left rein, and made for the exact spot at which the bull had reappeared. He found himself on the edge of a tiny cliff which dropped twenty feet in a sheer fall to a little stream, and he was compelled to ride along the bank until he reached the incline which the buffalo had descended. He forded the stream, galloped under the opposite bank across a patch of ground which had been trampled into mud by the hoofs of beasts coming here to water, and mounted again to the open. The bull had gained a quarter of a mile's grace from his mistake, and was heading straight for a huge cone of granite.\nNorris recognised the cone. It towered up from the veld, its cliffs seamed into gullies by the rain-wash of ages, and he had used it more than once as a landmark during the last fortnight, for it rose due southwest of his camp.\nHe watched the bull approach the cone and vanish into one of the gullies. It did not reappear, and he rode forward, keeping a close eye upon the gully. As he came opposite to it, however, he saw through the opening a vista of green trees flashing in the sunlight. He turned his horse through the passage, and reined up in a granite amphitheatre. The floor seemed about half a mile in diameter; it was broken into hillocks, and strewn with patches of a dense undergrowth, while here and there a big tree grew. The walls, which converged slightly towards an open top, were robed from summit to base with wild flowers, so that the whole circumference of the cone was one blaze of colour.\nNorris hitched forward and reloaded the rifle. Then he advanced slowly between the bushes on the alert for a charge from the wounded bull; but nothing stirred. No sound came to his ears except the soft padding noise of his horse's hoofs upon the turf. There was not a crackle of the brushwood, and the trees seemed carved out of metal. He rode through absolute silence in a suspension of all movement. Once his horse trod upon a bough, and the snapping of the twigs sounded like so many cracks of a pistol. At first the silence struck Norris as merely curious, a little later as very lonesome. Once or twice he stopped his horse with a sudden jerk of the reins, and sat crouched forwards with his neck outstretched, listening. Once or twice he cast a quick, furtive glance over his shoulder to make certain that no one stood between himself and the entrance to the hollow. He forgot the buffalo; he caught himself labouring his breath, and found it necessary to elaborately explain the circumstance in his thoughts on the ground of heat.\nThe next moment he began to plead this heat not merely as an excuse for his uneasiness, but as a reason for returning to camp. The heat was intense, he argued. Above him the light of an African midday sun poured out of a brassy sky into a sort of inverted funnel, and lay in blinding pools upon the scattered slabs of rock. Within the hollow, every cup of the innumerable flowers which tapestried the cliffs seemed a mouth breathing heat. He became possessed with a parching thirst, and he felt his tongue heavy and fibrous like a dried fig. There was, however, one obstacle which prevented him from acting upon his impulse, and that obstacle was his sense of shame. It was not so much that he thought it cowardly to give up the chase and quietly return, but he knew that the second after he had given way, he would be galloping madly towards the entrance in no child's panic of terror. He finally compromised matters by dropping the reins upon his horse's neck in the unformulated hope that the animal would turn of its own accord; but the horse kept straight on.\nAs Norris drew towards the innermost wall of granite, there was a quick rustle all across its face as though the screen of shrubs and flowers had been fluttered by a draught of wind. Norris drew himself erect with a distinct appearance of relief, loosened the clench of his fingers upon his rifle, and began once more to search the bushes for the buffalo.\nFor a moment his attention was arrested by a queer object lying upon the ground to his left. It was in shape something like a melon, but bigger, and it seemed to be plastered over with a black mould. Norris rode by it, turned a corner, and then with a gasp reined back his horse upon its haunches. Straight in front of him a broken rifle lay across the path.\nNorris stood still, and stared at it stupidly. Some vague recollection floated elusively through his brain. He tried to grasp and fix it clearly in his mind. It was a recollection of something which had happened a long while ago, in England, when he was at school. Suddenly, he remembered. It was not something which had happened, but something he had read under the great elm trees in the close. It was that passage in Robinson Crusoe which tells of the naked footprint in the sand.\nNorris dismounted, and stooped to lift the rifle; but all at once he straightened himself, and swung round with his arms guarding his head. There was no one, however, behind him, and he gave a little quavering laugh, and picked up the rifle. It was a heavy lo-bore Holland, a Holland with a single barrel, and that barrel was twisted like a corkscrew. The lock had been wrenched off, and there were marks upon the stock—marks of teeth, and other queer, unintelligible marks as well.\nNorris held the rifle in his hands, gazing vacantly straight ahead. He was thinking of the direction in which he had come, southwest, and of the stream which he had crossed, and of the patch of trampled mud, where track obliterated track. He dropped the rifle. It rang upon a stone, and again the screen of foliage shivered and rustled. Norris, however, paid no attention to the movement, but ran back to that object which he had passed, and took it in his hands.\nIt was oval in shape, being slightly broader at one end than the other. Norris drew his knife and cleaned the mould from one side of it. To the touch of the blade it seemed softer than stone, and smoother than wood. \"More like bone,\" he said to himself. In the side which he had cleaned, there was a little round hole filled up with mould. Norris dug his knife in and scraped round the hole as one cleans a caked pipe. He drew out a little cube of mud. There was a second corresponding hole on the other side. He turned the narrower end of the thing upwards. It was hollow, he saw, but packed full of mould, and more deliberately packed, for there were finger-marks in the mould. \"What an aimless trick!\" he muttered vaguely.\nHe carried the thing back to the rifle, and, comparing them, understood those queer marks upon the stock. They were the mark of fingers, of human fingers, impressed faintly upon the wood with superhuman strength. He was holding the rifle in his hands and looking down at it; but he saw below the rifle, and he saw that his knees were shaking in a palsy.\nOn an instant he tossed the rifle away, and laughed to reassure himself—laughed out boldly, once, twice; and then he stopped with his eyes riveted upon the granite wall. At each laugh that he gave the shrubs and flowers rippled, and shook the sunlight from their leaves. For the first time he remarked the coincidence as something strange. He lifted up his face, but not a breath of air fanned it; he looked across the hollow, the trees and bushes stood immobile. He laughed a third time, louder than before, and all at once his laughter got hold of him; he sent it pealing out hysterically, burst after burst, until the hollow seemed brimming with the din of it. His body began to twist; he beat time to his laughter with his feet, and then he danced. He danced there alone in the African sunlight faster and faster, with a mad tossing of his limbs, and with his laughter grown to a yell. And as though to keep pace with him, each moment the shiver of the foliage increased. Up and down, crosswise and breadthwise, the flowers were tossed and flung, while their petals rained down the cliff's face in a purple storm. It appeared, indeed, to Norris that the very granite walls were moving.\nIn the midst of his dance he kicked something and stumbled. He stopped dead when he saw what that something was. It was the queer, mud-plastered object which he had compared with the broken rifle, and the sight of it recalled him to his wits. He tucked it hastily beneath his jacket, and looked about him for his horse. The horse was standing behind him some distance away, and nearer to the cliff. Norris snatched up his own rifle, and ran towards it. His hand was on the horse's mane, when just above its head he noticed a clean patch of granite, and across that space he saw a huge grey baboon leap, and then another, and another. ",
      "prompt": "Summarize the following document for Detective story 'How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg' by Unknown. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\nNorris wanted a holiday. He stood in the marketplace looking southwards to the chimney-stacks, and dilating upon the subject to three of his friends. He was sick of the Stock Exchange, the men, the women, the drinks, the dances—everything. He was as indifferent to the price of shares as to the rise and fall of the quicksilver in his barometer; he neither desired to go in on the ground floor nor to come out in the attics. He simply wanted to get clean away. Besides he foresaw a slump, and he would be actually saving money on the veld. At this point Teddy Isaacs strolled up and interrupted the oration.\n\"Where are you off to, then?\"\n\"Manicaland,\" answered Norris.\n\"Oh! You had better bring Barrington back.\"\nTeddy Isaacs was a fresh comer to the Rand, and knew no better. Barrington meant to him nothing more than the name of a man who had been lost twelve months before on the eastern borders of Mashonaland. But he saw three pairs of eyebrows lift simultaneously, and heard three simultaneous outbursts on the latest Uitlander grievance. However, Norris answered him quietly enough.\n\"Yes, if I come across Barrington, I'll bring him back.\" He nodded his head once or twice and smiled. \"You may make sure of that,\" he added, and turned away from the group.\nIsaacs gathered that there had been trouble between Barrington and Morris, and applied to his companions for information. The commencement of the trouble, he was told, dated back to the time when the two men were ostrich-farming side by side, close to Port Elizabeth in the Cape Colony. Norris owned a wife; Barrington did not. The story was sufficiently ugly as Johannesburg was accustomed to relate it, but upon this occasion Teddy Isaacs was allowed to infer the details. He was merely put in possession of the more immediate facts. Barrington had left the Cape Colony in a hurry, and coming north to the Transvaal when Johannesburg was as yet in its brief infancy, had prospered exceedingly. Meanwhile, Norris, as the ostrich industry declined, had gone from worse to worse, and finally he too drifted to Johannesburg with the rest of the flotsam of South Africa. He came to the town alone, and met Barrington one morning eye to eye on the Stock Exchange. A certain amount of natural disappointment was expressed when the pair were seen to separate without hostilities; but it was subsequently remarked that they were fighting out their duel, though not in the conventional way. They fought with shares, and Barrington won. He had the clearer head, and besides, Norris didn't need much ruining; Barrington could see to that in his spare time. It was, in fact, as though Norris stood up with a derringer to face a machine gun. His turn, however, had come after Barrington's disappearance, and he was now able to contemplate an expedition into Manicaland without reckoning up his pass-book.\nHe bought a buck-wagon with a tent covering over the hinder part, provisions sufficient for six months, a span of oxen, a couple of horses salted for the thickhead sickness, hired a Griqua lad as wagon-driver, and half a dozen Matabele boys who were waiting for a chance to return, and started northeastward.\nFrom Johannesburg he travelled to Makoni's town, near the Zimbabwe ruins, and with half a dozen brass rings and an empty cartridge case hired a Ma-ongwi boy, who had been up to the Mashonaland plateau before. The lad guided him to the head waters of the Inyazuri, and there Norris fenced in his camp, in a grass country fairly wooded, and studded with gigantic blocks of granite.\nThe Ma-ongwi boy chose the site, fifty yards west of an ant-heap, and about a quarter of a mile from a forest of machabel. He had camped on the spot before, he said.\n\"When?\" asked Norris.\n\"Twice,\" replied the boy. \"Three years ago and last year.\"\n\"Last year?\" Norris looked up with a start of surprise. \"You were up here last year?\"\n\"Yes!\"\nFor a moment or two Norris puffed at his pipe, then he asked slowly—\n\"Who with?\"\n\"Mr. Barrington,\" the boy told him, and added, \"It is his wagon-track which we have been following.\"\nNorris rose from the ground, and walked straight ahead for the distance of a hundred yards until he reached a jasmine bush, which stood in a bee-line with the opening of his camp fence. Thence he moved round in a semicircle until he came upon a wagon-track in the rear of the camp, and, after pausing there, he went forward again, and completed the circle. He returned to his wagon chuckling. Barrington, he remembered, had been lost while travelling northwards to the Zambesie; but the track stopped here. There was not a trace of it to the north or the east or the west. It was evident that the boy had chosen Barrington's last camping-ground as the site for his own, and he discovered a comforting irony in the fact. He felt that he was standing in Barrington's shoes.\nThat night, as he was smoking by the fire, he called out to the\nMa-ongwi boy. The lad came forward from his hut behind the wagon.\n\n\"Tell me how you lost him,\" said Norris.\n\"He rode that way alone after a sable antelope.\" The boy pointed an arm to the southwest. \"The beast was wounded, and we followed its blood-spoor. We found Mr. Barrington's horse gored by the antelope's horns. He himself had gone forward on foot. We tracked him to a little stream, but the opposite bank was trampled, and we lost all sign of him.\" This is what the boy said though his language is translated.\nNorris remained upon this encampment for a fortnight. Blue wildebeests, koodoos, elands, and gems-bok were plentiful, and once he got a shot at a wart-hog boar. At the end of the fortnight he walked round the ant-heap early one morning, and of a sudden plumped down full length in the grass. Straight in front of him he saw a herd of buffaloes moving in his direction down a glade of the forest a quarter of a mile away. Norris cast a glance backwards; the camp was hidden from the herd by the intervening ant-heap. He looked again towards the forest; the buffaloes advanced slowly, pasturing as they moved. Norris crawled behind the ant-heap on his hands and knees, ran thence into the camp, buckled on a belt of cartridges, snatched up a 450-bore Metford rifle, and got back to his position just as the first of the herd stepped into the open. It turned to the right along the edge of the wood, and the others followed in file. Norris wriggled forward through the grass, and selecting a fat bull in the centre of the line, aimed behind its shoulder and fired. The herd stampeded into the forest, the bull fell in its tracks.\nNorris sprang forward with a shout; but he had not run more than thirty yards before the bull began to kick. It kneeled upon its forelegs, rose thence on to its hind legs, and finally stood up. Norris guessed what had happened. He had hit the bull in the neck instead of behind the shoulders, and had broken no bones. He fired his second barrel as the brute streamed away in an oblique line southeastwards from the wood, and missed. Then he ran back to camp, slapped a bridle on to his swiftest horse, and without waiting to saddle it, sprang on its back and galloped in pursuit. He rode as it were along the base of a triangle, whereas the bull galloped from the apex, and since his breakfast was getting hot behind him, he wished to make that triangle an isosceles. So he jammed his heels into his horse's ribs, and was fast drawing within easy range, when the buffalo got his wind and swerved on the instant into a diagonal course due southwest.\nThe manoeuvre left Norris directly behind his quarry, and with a long, stern chase in prospect. However, his blood was up, and he held on to wear the beast down. He forgot his breakfast; he took no more than a casual notice of the direction he was following; he simply braced his knees in a closer grip, while the distorted shadows of himself and the horse lengthened and thinned along the ground as the sun rose over his right shoulder.\nSuddenly the buffalo disappeared in a dip of the veld, and a few moments later came again into view a good hundred yards further to the south. Norris pulled his left rein, and made for the exact spot at which the bull had reappeared. He found himself on the edge of a tiny cliff which dropped twenty feet in a sheer fall to a little stream, and he was compelled to ride along the bank until he reached the incline which the buffalo had descended. He forded the stream, galloped under the opposite bank across a patch of ground which had been trampled into mud by the hoofs of beasts coming here to water, and mounted again to the open. The bull had gained a quarter of a mile's grace from his mistake, and was heading straight for a huge cone of granite.\nNorris recognised the cone. It towered up from the veld, its cliffs seamed into gullies by the rain-wash of ages, and he had used it more than once as a landmark during the last fortnight, for it rose due southwest of his camp.\nHe watched the bull approach the cone and vanish into one of the gullies. It did not reappear, and he rode forward, keeping a close eye upon the gully. As he came opposite to it, however, he saw through the opening a vista of green trees flashing in the sunlight. He turned his horse through the passage, and reined up in a granite amphitheatre. The floor seemed about half a mile in diameter; it was broken into hillocks, and strewn with patches of a dense undergrowth, while here and there a big tree grew. The walls, which converged slightly towards an open top, were robed from summit to base with wild flowers, so that the whole circumference of the cone was one blaze of colour.\nNorris hitched forward and reloaded the rifle. Then he advanced slowly between the bushes on the alert for a charge from the wounded bull; but nothing stirred. No sound came to his ears except the soft padding noise of his horse's hoofs upon the turf. There was not a crackle of the brushwood, and the trees seemed carved out of metal. He rode through absolute silence in a suspension of all movement. Once his horse trod upon a bough, and the snapping of the twigs sounded like so many cracks of a pistol. At first the silence struck Norris as merely curious, a little later as very lonesome. Once or twice he stopped his horse with a sudden jerk of the reins, and sat crouched forwards with his neck outstretched, listening. Once or twice he cast a quick, furtive glance over his shoulder to make certain that no one stood between himself and the entrance to the hollow. He forgot the buffalo; he caught himself labouring his breath, and found it necessary to elaborately explain the circumstance in his thoughts on the ground of heat.\nThe next moment he began to plead this heat not merely as an excuse for his uneasiness, but as a reason for returning to camp. The heat was intense, he argued. Above him the light of an African midday sun poured out of a brassy sky into a sort of inverted funnel, and lay in blinding pools upon the scattered slabs of rock. Within the hollow, every cup of the innumerable flowers which tapestried the cliffs seemed a mouth breathing heat. He became possessed with a parching thirst, and he felt his tongue heavy and fibrous like a dried fig. There was, however, one obstacle which prevented him from acting upon his impulse, and that obstacle was his sense of shame. It was not so much that he thought it cowardly to give up the chase and quietly return, but he knew that the second after he had given way, he would be galloping madly towards the entrance in no child's panic of terror. He finally compromised matters by dropping the reins upon his horse's neck in the unformulated hope that the animal would turn of its own accord; but the horse kept straight on.\nAs Norris drew towards the innermost wall of granite, there was a quick rustle all across its face as though the screen of shrubs and flowers had been fluttered by a draught of wind. Norris drew himself erect with a distinct appearance of relief, loosened the clench of his fingers upon his rifle, and began once more to search the bushes for the buffalo.\nFor a moment his attention was arrested by a queer object lying upon the ground to his left. It was in shape something like a melon, but bigger, and it seemed to be plastered over with a black mould. Norris rode by it, turned a corner, and then with a gasp reined back his horse upon its haunches. Straight in front of him a broken rifle lay across the path.\nNorris stood still, and stared at it stupidly. Some vague recollection floated elusively through his brain. He tried to grasp and fix it clearly in his mind. It was a recollection of something which had happened a long while ago, in England, when he was at school. Suddenly, he remembered. It was not something which had happened, but something he had read under the great elm trees in the close.

    "final_summary": "The detective story \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg,\" authored by Unknown, unfolds through the perspective of Norris, a man weary of his life amid the exhausting chaos of Johannesburg's Stock Exchange. At the story’s outset, Norris expresses a desperate longing for a holiday far from the relentless market hustle, social superficialities, and financial anxieties that dominate his days. The slump he anticipates in the market urges him toward the open veld, where he hopes to find respite and perhaps save money by escaping the unstable economic climate.\n\nDuring a conversation with three friends at a marketplace, Norris reveals his plan to journey to Manicaland. The topic of Barrington emerges unexpectedly when Teddy Isaacs, a newcomer to Johannesburg, suggests that Norris bring Barrington back with him. To Isaacs, Barrington is merely a name—a man who vanished a year earlier in the wilderness on the eastern borders of Mashonaland—but to Norris and the others, Barrington carries a heavier, charged significance. The story behind Barrington’s disappearance is linked deeply with a bitter rivalry between him and Norris, rooted in their ostrich-farming past near Port Elizabeth in the Cape Colony.\n\nThe narrative reveals that Norris and Barrington once farmed ostriches side by side, but their relationship was strained and marked by personal jealousy and conflict. Norris was married, whereas Barrington was not, a detail that contributed to the tension between them. When the ostrich industry declined, Norris’s fortunes deteriorated, and he drifted north to Johannesburg, just as Barrington had done earlier. In Johannesburg, the rivalry manifested through their dealings on the Stock Exchange, described figuratively as a duel fought not with weapons but with shares. Barrington proved the more calculating and successful of the two, resulting in Norris’s continued misfortunes.\n\nBarrington had disappeared roughly a year prior while on an expedition northward toward the Zambesi River, lost somewhere on the eastern borders of Mashonaland. With a mixture of hope and determination, Norris outfitted himself for an expedition to find Barrington. He prepared extensively: he purchased a buck-wagon with a canvas tent, stocked provisions for six months, acquired oxen and horses, and recruited a small party including a Griqua wagon-driver and Matabele boys eager to return to their homeland. His journey took him northeast from Johannesburg to Makoni’s town near the Zimbabwe ruins.\n\nAt Makoni’s town, Norris secured the guidance of a Ma-ongwi boy, who possessed local knowledge and had previously traveled the Mashonaland plateau, including twice having camped where Norris planned to stay. The boy's familiarity with the territory and Barrington’s tracks was invaluable. Encouragingly, the boy confirmed that Barrington’s wagon-track led to their campsite—a discovery that gave Norris both a feeling of connection to the missing man and a certain ironic satisfaction at standing in Barrington’s \"shoes.\"\n\nNorris settled at the camp for two weeks. During his stay, he hunted local game—blue wildebeests, koodoos, elands, gems-bok, and attempted to bag a wart-hog boar—and adapted to the wild rhythm of the land. One morning, while surveying the surroundings, he spotted a herd of buffalo approaching. Seizing the opportunity, Norris armed himself and carefully stalked the herd, shooting a bull buffalo. However, to his dismay, the bull was wounded but not fatally. A vigorous chase ensued, taking Norris through the African veld, across a stream, and ultimately to a great granite cone he had used as a landmark during his stay.\n\nRiding into the granite amphitheater formed at the base of the cone, Norris was struck by the stunning beauty and intense heat of the place. The cliffs, festooned with wild flowers in riotous bloom, formed a natural enclosure radiating vivid color and searing sunlight, which contrasted with the eerie silence that filled the hollow. This silence soon unsettled Norris. Despite a strong, dry thirst and the oppressive midday heat, he forced himself to continue his exploration.\n\nWhile moving cautiously through the encampment, Norris notices peculiar objects lying by the path: a large, mold-covered item resembling a melon and, more disturbingly, a broken rifle. The rifle was in a damaged state—twisted barrel, lock removed, unmistakable marks of human teeth, and faint impressions of fingers pressing hard upon the wood. The sight awakens a buried memory in Norris, reminiscent of the “naked footprint in the sand” from Robinson Crusoe, symbolizing a lost trail or mysterious disappearance.\n\nHis unease intensifies as the natural foliage around him seems to stir despite the absence of wind, creating an uncanny atmosphere. Norris abruptly shifts focus to the mold-covered object, cleaning patches with his knife and discovering it to be hollow yet packed with hardened mud that bore finger impressions. This strange artifact, coupled with the mutilated rifle, suggests a human presence and struggle—possibly linked to Barrington’s fate.\n\nOvercome momentarily by tension and isolation, Norris erupts into uncontrollable laughter and a wild, frantic dance amidst the flowers, the sun, and the granite walls, as if battling his own fear and loneliness. This hysterical outburst makes the surrounding vegetation ripple almost miraculously, mirroring his rapid, unsettling emotions.\n\nJust as his laughter subsides, Norris spots a group of baboons leaping across a clean granite patch above his horse’s head—a sudden wildlife intrusion that punctuates the eerie and charged atmosphere of the scene.\n\nIn summary, \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg\" encapsulates Norris’s journey in search of Barrington, weaving together themes of rivalry, mystery, isolation, and the overpowering force of the African wilderness. Norris’s expedition reveals poignant clues about Barrington’s disappearance but also plunges him into a surreal confrontation with nature and his own psyche. His discovery of Barrington’s last known campsite, the broken rifle, and the strange mud-covered object suggests that Barrington’s fate remains shrouded in mystery, promising further revelation or danger. The story ends on an ambiguous and tense note, with Norris both physically and psychologically enveloped by the wild landscape, underscoring the unknown perils that lie ahead for him and the enigma of Barrington’s vanished existence.",
    "reference": "When Norris travels to South Africa for a vacation, he is well aware that he is following the same route that his nemesis Barrington did when he vanished mysteriously a year earlier. One morning, Norris becomes lost in the African wilderness while chasing a buffalo and finds evidence that reveals the reason behind Barrington’s disappearance."
