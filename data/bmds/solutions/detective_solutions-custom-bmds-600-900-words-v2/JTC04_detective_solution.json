    "full_text": "\"The Blue Sequin,\" a detective story involving Dr. Thorndyke and his companion Jervis, unfolds with the discovery of a brutal murder on a train near the small town of Woldhurst. The story begins with Thorndyke anxiously waiting at a train platform, concerned that they have missed meeting Mr. Edward Stopford, a solicitor from the firm Stopford and Myers, who had summoned them urgently to direct the defense in an important case. Stopford had planned to travel to Woldhurst by the 8.25 train from Charing Cross and promised to call for them but failed to do so. Eventually, Stopford barely catches a later train and meets Thorndyke and Jervis at Halbury Junction, where they change to a branch line.\n\nThorndyke laments the lack of preparation, as they directly confront a serious inquiry without prior briefings. He reads a newspaper account of the murder discovered by a railway porter who found a fashionably dressed woman dead in a first-class train compartment. Medical examination reveals the woman had been killed by a penetrating wound to the head, caused by a pointed implement with great force that fractured the skull and entered the brain. The police find robbery is unlikely since the victim’s expensive jewelry and belongings remain untouched. Rumors of an arrest circulate.\n\nEdward Stopford divulges details of his connection to the case: the murdered woman, Edith Grant, was a former artist’s model and acquaintance of his brother, Harold Stopford, an established painter. The two had a complicated personal history, including exchanged letters and gifts, notably a beaded chain with a locket containing Harold’s portrait. Edith refused to return the locket when Harold, now engaged to another, requested its exchange for a less compromising present. \n\nOn the morning of the murder, Harold and Edith boarded the branch line train together; she was traveling to Worthing, and he was heading to Shinglehurst, the stop before Woldhurst. They occupied a first-class compartment alone and were witnessed by railway staff quarrelling. At Shinglehurst, Harold exited the train, carrying his complete sketching kit, including a large holland umbrella with a distinctive lower joint made from ash fitted with a powerful steel spike. Shortly after, police arrested Harold. \n\nCircumstantial evidence mounts against Harold: he was the last person seen with Edith, they argued just prior to her death, and he possessed the potential murder weapon, the umbrella-spike. The broken locket and chain were found in his possession, apparently torn from Edith by force. However, his character is widely known as gentle and amiable, leading Stopford to worry that the evidence is overwhelmingly against him but might be misleading.\n\nThorndyke and the others arrive at Woldhurst, where the murdered woman’s first-class compartment is sealed by the police. The station master informs them no other first-class passengers were aboard and no one boarded after Halbury. Thorndyke investigates the compartment exterior meticulously, paying special attention to the footboards and windows, collecting minute evidence and applying a fine powder to reveal details not visible to the naked eye.\n\nThorndyke also speaks with the local platelayers who were working near the crime scene. These men, strangers to the district and considered rough characters, are not suspected by Thorndyke, who insists on gathering all facts without prejudice.\n\nThe next step is visiting the police station, where the inspector shows them Harold Stopford’s effects, including his painting materials, the umbrella-spike weapon, and the sketch he completed on the morning of the murder. Thorndyke notes the artistic materials are unexpectedly tidy and well cared for, which may be significant. The sketch is remarkable for its speed of execution and quality, possibly indicating Harold’s focused and untroubled state during the time he was painting, conflicting with the idea of guilt.\n\nAt the mortuary, Thorndyke examines Edith Grant’s clothing and personal effects with a touching sense of pathos. Her \"picture hat\" adorned with dark-blue sequins has a ragged hole on the brim, matching the location where the fatal wound was inflicted. Thorndyke collects some fallen sequins and hair from the wound edges for analysis. The victim’s body shows two principal wounds: the fatal circular hole in the skull behind and above the left ear and a contused bruise or cut running down the right cheek, which ethereal padding in the compartment seats cannot easily explain. The disfigurement caused by a peroxide hair treatment is noted, adding a dimension to her appearance. Thorndyke wonders about the mechanics of the injuries and their circumstances within the confined compartment.\n\nAware of the approaching post-mortem examination, Thorndyke realizes he requires ox-gall, a substance used in his forensic techniques to uncover invisible details—a sign of his meticulous and scientific approach to investigation. Finding no ox-gall at the local chemist, he negotiates with the local butcher, Mr. Felton, to have a healthy steer slaughtered immediately to produce a fresh supply. While examining the cattle, Thorndyke discovers one beast has a sensitive and possibly unhealthy horn, which he instructs the butcher to remove and send for microscopic examination.\n\nBack at their hotel, Thorndyke conducts a detailed microscopic analysis of the removed horn, identifying that it contains cortical brain tissue rather than just simple horn material. This result surprises Edward Stopford and Jervis, as it implies that the horn tissue is not normal, and offers a crucial clue that will influence the defense's case and likely exonerate Harold Stopford. Thorndyke declares that the defense’s case is practically complete based on this discovery.\n\nIn summary, \"The Blue Sequin\" presents a complex murder mystery involving a brutal killing on a train, a host of circumstantial evidence pointing to the prime suspect Harold Stopford, and the methodical, scientific investigation led by Dr. Thorndyke. The narrative details the social and emotional context connecting the suspect and victim, the nature of the wounds, and Thorndyke's forensic examination and clever deduction.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive\n   • Harold Stopford: Had quarrelled with Edith Grant and wanted the compromising locket back, but he had no financial or passionate motive to kill; on the contrary he was hurrying to his fiancée.\n   • Any unknown robber: Jewellery worth £300 was left untouched, therefore robbery is not a motive.\n   • The platelayers: no connection with the victim and nothing to gain.\n   • A totally accidental agency: has no motive – the wound would have been the result of chance rather than intention.\n\n2. Opportunity\n   • Harold was in the same compartment up to Shinglehurst, but from that moment to the discovery of the body he was miles away painting his landscape – and several people watched him at work.\n   • Nobody else entered the locked first-class compartment after Harold left; the guard and station–master are positive on this.\n   • Something outside the train could reach the victim only if a window were open and the two trains passed one another at very close quarters.\n\n3. Physical evidence\n   • Nature of the wound: a round puncture driven with enormous force, large enough to carry fragments of hat brim and sequins into the skull.  A steel umbrella‐spike would have made a clean circular hole and would not have carried cloth or sequins in with it.\n   • Position of the wounds: the puncture was behind and above the left ear; a second bruise ran down the right cheek.  This is exactly what a slanting upward thrust from outside would produce – the tip entering behind the ear, the rough side of the horn scraping the opposite cheek.\n   • Exterior of the carriage: Thorndyke found blue sequins, hairs, and dots of blood adhering to the paint well outside the window line – proof that the blow was delivered from without.\n   • Harold’s painting kit and his demeanour: brushes cleaned, palette wiped, a rapid but finished sketch; not the conduct of a man an hour after committing a savage murder.\n   • The umbrella-spike: chemically and microscopically clean – no blood, bone, hair, or hat-felt.\n   • The injured steer’s horn: Thorndyke obtained the horn because the beast flinched when it was touched.  On sawing it across, the central cavity was packed with recent human cerebral tissue mingled with fibres of blue felt and a sequin.  Nothing except that horn can have produced those contents.\n\n4. Logical deduction\n   • Only an object introduced from outside could carry sequins to the carriage exterior.\n   • Only a living horn could give way springily enough to withdraw instantly and leave no splinters in the wound.\n   • The steer travelled that very morning in a cattle-truck on the down line, side-by-side with the 8.25 branch train at the spot where the platelayers were working (Thorndyke ascertained the timetables).\n   • When the two trains met the victim was either leaning out or sitting near the open window.  The steer, irritated by its tender horn, swung its head out between the slats; the trains went past one another at thirty miles an hour; the sharp tip ran through the hat brim, pierced the skull, stripped off a shower of sequins, tore away the locket-chain, and was instantly snatched clear.\n   • Edith Grant died instantly; the carriage door remained locked from within, so nobody discovered the body until the porter looked in at Woldhurst.\n   • Harold had obtained the locket a few minutes earlier, so the broken chain found on him is fully accounted for.\n\nTherefore no human being murdered Edith Grant – the act was a freak railway accident.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nHarold Stopford, the platelayers, an unknown robber or passenger, Mr. Edward Stopford, Mr. Felton the butcher, the steer in Felton’s cattle-truck\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nFelton’s steer (an unnamed polled Devon with the injured horn)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n07:50 a.m.  Edith Grant and Harold Stopford enter an empty first-class compartment at Charing Cross.\n8:25 a.m.   Train leaves; the pair quarrel; Edith at last unclasps the blue-bead chain and gives Harold the locket.  The chain breaks.\n9:02 a.m.   They reach Shinglehurst; Harold gets out with his sketching kit to spend the day painting.  Edith keeps her seat, opens the window for air, and continues towards Woldhurst.\n9:11 a.m.   Near Mile-post 14, a slow goods train on the adjacent line is passing in the opposite direction.  In an end truck are Felton’s cattle.  One steer, its horn inflamed, pokes its head through the slats.  As the two trains flash by, the tip of the horn enters Edith’s window: the rough base of the horn strikes her right cheek; the point drives through her hat and skull behind the left ear.  The horn catches her dangling chain and rips it away, at the same moment scattering a shower of blue sequins outside.  The steer jerks back; both trains roar on.  Edith collapses dead on the seat.\n9:28 a.m.   The train reaches Woldhurst; a porter tries the handle, finds the door locked, and, looking through the window, discovers the body.\nEarly afternoon  Thorndyke, having examined the exterior of the coach, guesses at a horn; finds the sensitive-horned steer at Felton’s yard; has the horn sawn across; confirms the presence of human brain and a blue sequin.\nThus the “murder” is shown to be a tragic accident, and Harold Stopford is cleared.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nHarold Stopford – Left the compartment before the death, possesses an alibi supported by several witnesses, and his alleged weapon is spotless.  \nPlatelayers – Were fifty yards from the line; no blood or sequins on their tools; they never approached the carriage.  \nUnknown robber/passenger – No one entered the locked compartment and no property was taken.  \nEdward Stopford – Was in London all morning; no contact with victim.  \nMr. Felton the butcher – Owned the steer but neither intended nor could foresee the freak accident; no mens rea.  \nOnly the steer’s horn physically matches every scrap of evidence, leaving every human suspect blameless.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "text": "Thorndyke stood looking up and down the platform with anxiety that increased as the time drew near for the departure of the train.\n\"This is very unfortunate,\" he said, reluctantly stepping into an empty smoking compartment as the guard executed a flourish with his green flag. \"I am afraid we have missed our friend.\" He closed the door, and, as the train began to move, thrust his head out of the window.\n\"Now I wonder if that will be he,\" he continued. \"If so, he has caught the train by the skin of his teeth, and is now in one of the rear compartments.\"\nThe subject of Thorndyke's speculations was Mr. Edward Stopford, of the firm of Stopford and Myers, of Portugal Street, solicitors, and his connection with us at present arose out of a telegram that had reached our chambers on the preceding evening. It was reply-paid, and ran thus:\n\"Can you come here to-morrow to direct defence? Important case. All costs undertaken by us.—STOPFORD AND MYERS.\"\nThorndyke's reply had been in the affirmative, and early on this present morning a further telegram—evidently posted overnight—had been delivered:\n\"Shall leave for Woldhurst by 8.25 from Charing Cross. Will call for you if possible.—EDWARD STOPFORD.\"\nHe had not called, however, and, since he was unknown personally to us both, we could not judge whether or not he had been among the passengers on the platform.\n\"It is most unfortunate,\" Thorndyke repeated, \"for it deprives us of that preliminary consideration of the case which is so invaluable.\" He filled his pipe thoughtfully, and, having made a fruitless inspection of the platform at London Bridge, took up the paper that he had bought at the bookstall, and began to turn over the leaves, running his eye quickly down the columns, unmindful of the journalistic baits in paragraph or article.\n\"It is a great disadvantage,\" he observed, while still glancing through the paper, \"to come plump into an inquiry without preparation—to be confronted with the details before one has a chance of considering the case in general terms. For instance—\"\nHe paused, leaving the sentence unfinished, and as I looked up inquiringly I saw that he had turned over another page, and was now reading attentively.\n\"This looks like our case, Jervis,\" he said presently, handing me the paper and indicating a paragraph at the top of the page. It was quite brief, and was headed \"Terrible Murder in Kent,\" the account being as follows:\n\"A shocking crime was discovered yesterday morning at the little town of Woldhurst, which lies on the branch line from Halbury Junction. The discovery was made by a porter who was inspecting the carriages of the train which had just come in. On opening the door of a first-class compartment, he was horrified to find the body of a fashionably-dressed woman stretched upon the floor. Medical aid was immediately summoned, and on the arrival of the divisional surgeon, Dr. Morton, it was ascertained that the woman had not been dead more than a few minutes.\n\"The state of the corpse leaves no doubt that a murder of a most brutal kind has been perpetrated, the cause of death being a penetrating wound of the head, inflicted with some pointed implement, which must have been used with terrible violence, since it has perforated the skull and entered the brain. That robbery was not the motive of the crime is made clear by the fact that an expensively fitted dressing-bag was found on the rack, and that the dead woman's jewellery, including several valuable diamond rings, was untouched. It is rumoured that an arrest has been made by the local police.\"\n\"A gruesome affair,\" I remarked, as I handed back the paper, \"but the report does not give us much information.\"\n\"It does not,\" Thorndyke agreed, \"and yet it gives us something to consider. Here is a perforating wound of the skull, inflicted with some pointed implement—that is, assuming that it is not a bullet wound. Now, what kind of implement would be capable of inflicting such an injury? How would such an implement be used in the confined space of a railway-carriage, and what sort of person would be in possession of such an implement? These are preliminary questions that are worth considering, and I commend them to you, together with the further problems of the possible motive—excluding robbery—and any circumstances other than murder which might account for the injury.\"\n\"The choice of suitable implements is not very great,\" I observed.\n\"It is very limited, and most of them, such as a plasterer's pick or a geological hammer, are associated with certain definite occupations. You have a notebook?\"\nI had, and, accepting the hint, I produced it and pursued my further reflections in silence, while my companion, with his notebook also on his knee, gazed steadily out of the window. And thus he remained, wrapped in thought, jotting down an entry now and again in his book, until the train slowed down at Halbury Junction, where we had to change on to a branch line.\nAs we stepped out, I noticed a well-dressed man hurrying up the platform from the rear and eagerly scanning the faces of the few passengers who had alighted. Soon he espied us, and, approaching quickly, asked, as he looked from one of us to the other:\n\"Dr. Thorndyke?\"\n\"Yes,\" replied my colleague, adding: \"And you, I presume, are Mr. Edward Stopford?\"\nThe solicitor bowed. \"This is a dreadful affair,\" he said, in an agitated manner. \"I see you have the paper. A most shocking affair. I am immensely relieved to find you here. Nearly missed the train, and feared I should miss you.\"\n\"There appears to have been an arrest,\" Thorndyke began.\n\"Yes—my brother. Terrible business. Let us walk up the platform; our train won't start for a quarter of an hour yet.\"\nWe deposited our joint Gladstone and Thorndyke's travelling-case in an empty first-class compartment, and then, with the solicitor between us, strolled up to the unfrequented end of the platform.\n\"My brother's position,\" said Mr. Stopford, \"fills me with dismay—but let me give you the facts in order, and you shall judge for yourself. This poor creature who has been murdered so brutally was a Miss Edith Grant. She was formerly an artist's model, and as such was a good deal employed by my brother, who is a painter—Harold Stopford, you know, A.R.A. now—\"\n\"I know his work very well, and charming work it is.\"\n\"I think so, too. Well, in those days he was quite a youngster—about twenty—and he became very intimate with Miss Grant, in quite an innocent way, though not very discreet; but she was a nice respectable girl, as most English models are, and no one thought any harm. However, a good many letters passed between them, and some little presents, amongst which was a beaded chain carrying a locket, and in this he was fool enough to put his portrait and the inscription, 'Edith, from Harold.'\n\"Later on Miss Grant, who had a rather good voice, went on the stage, in the comic opera line, and, in consequence, her habits and associates changed somewhat; and, as Harold had meanwhile become engaged, he was naturally anxious to get his letters back, and especially to exchange the locket for some less compromising gift. The letters she eventually sent him, but refused absolutely to part with the locket.\n\"Now, for the last month Harold has been staying at Halbury, making sketching excursions into the surrounding country, and yesterday morning he took the train to Shinglehurst, the third station from here, and the one before Woldhurst.\n\"On the platform here he met Miss Grant, who had come down from London, and was going on to Worthing. They entered the branch train together, having a first-class compartment to themselves. It seems she was wearing his locket at the time, and he made another appeal to her to make an exchange, which she refused, as before. The discussion appears to have become rather heated and angry on both sides, for the guard and a porter at Munsden both noticed that they seemed to be quarrelling; but the upshot of the affair was that the lady snapped the chain, and tossed it together with the locket to my brother, and they parted quite amiably at Shinglehurst, where Harold got out. He was then carrying his full sketching kit, including a large holland umbrella, the lower joint of which is an ash staff fitted with a powerful steel spike for driving into the ground.\n\"It was about half-past ten when he got out at Shinglehurst; by eleven he had reached his pitch and got to work, and he painted steadily for three hours. Then he packed up his traps, and was just starting on his way back to the station, when he was met by the police and arrested.\n\"And now, observe the accumulation of circumstantial evidence against him. He was the last person seen in company with the murdered woman—for no one seems to have seen her after they left Munsden; he appeared to be quarrelling with her when she was last seen alive, he had a reason for possibly wishing for her death, he was provided with an implement—a spiked staff—capable of inflicting the injury which caused her death, and, when he was searched, there was found in his possession the locket and broken chain, apparently removed from her person with violence.\n\"Against all this is, of course, his known character—he is the gentlest and most amiable of men—and his subsequent conduct—imbecile to the last degree if he had been guilty; but, as a lawyer, I can't help seeing that appearances are almost hopelessly against him.\"\n\"We won't say 'hopelessly,'\" replied Thorndyke, as we took our places in the carriage, \"though I expect the police are pretty cocksure. When does the inquest open?\"\n\"To-day at four. I have obtained an order from the coroner for you to examine the body and be present at the post-mortem.\"\n\"Do you happen to know the exact position of the wound?\"\n\"Yes; it is a little above and behind the left ear—a horrible round hole, with a ragged cut or tear running from it to the side of the forehead.\"\n\"And how was the body lying?\"\n\"Right along the floor, with the feet close to the off-side door.\"\n\"Was the wound on the head the only one?\"\n\"No; there was a long cut or bruise on the right cheek—a contused wound the police surgeon called it, which he believes to have been inflicted with a heavy and rather blunt weapon. I have not heard of any other wounds or bruises.\"\n\"Did anyone enter the train yesterday at Shinglehurst?\" Thorndyke asked.\n\"No one entered the train after it left Halbury.\"\nThorndyke considered these statements in silence, and presently fell into a brown study, from which he roused only as the train moved out of Shinglehurst station.\n\"It would be about here that the murder was committed,\" said Mr. Stopford; \"at least, between here and Woldhurst.\"\nThorndyke nodded rather abstractedly, being engaged at the moment in observing with great attention the objects that were visible from the windows.\n\"I notice,\" he remarked presently, \"a number of chips scattered about between the rails, and some of the chair-wedges look new. Have there been any platelayers at work lately?\"\n\"Yes,\" answered Stopford, \"they are on the line now, I believe—at least, I saw a gang working near Woldhurst yesterday, and they are said to have set a rick on fire; I saw it smoking when I came down.\"\n\"Indeed; and this middle line of rails is, I suppose, a sort of siding?\"\n\"Yes; they shunt the goods trains and empty trucks on to it. There are the remains of the rick—still smouldering, you see.\"\nThorndyke gazed absently at the blackened heap until an empty cattle-truck on the middle track hid it from view. This was succeeded by a line of goods-waggons, and these by a passenger coach, one compartment of which—a first-class—was closed up and sealed. The train now began to slow down rather suddenly, and a couple of minutes later we brought up in Woldhurst station.\nIt was evident that rumours of Thorndyke's advent had preceded us, for the entire staff—two porters, an inspector, and the station-master—were waiting expectantly on the platform, and the latter came forward, regardless of his dignity, to help us with our luggage.\n\"Do you think I could see the carriage?\" Thorndyke asked the solicitor.\n\"Not the inside, sir,\" said the station-master, on being appealed to. \"The police have sealed it up. You would have to ask the inspector.\"\n\"Well, I can have a look at the outside, I suppose?\" said Thorndyke, and to this the station-master readily agreed, and offered to accompany us.\n\"What other first-class passengers were there?\" Thorndyke asked.\n\"None, sir. There was only one first-class coach, and the deceased was the only person in it. It has given us all a dreadful turn, this affair has,\" he continued, as we set off up the line. \"I was on the platform when the train came in. We were watching a rick that was burning up the line, and a rare blaze it made, too; and I was just saying that we should have to move the cattle-truck that was on the mid-track, because, you see, sir, the smoke and sparks were blowing across, and I thought it would frighten the poor beasts. And Mr. Felton he don't like his beasts handled roughly. He says it spoils the meat.\"\n\"No doubt he is right,\" said Thorndyke. \"But now, tell me, do you think it is possible for any person to board or leave the train on the off-side unobserved? Could a man, for instance, enter a compartment on the off-side at one station and drop off as the train was slowing down at the next, without being seen?\"\n\"I doubt it,\" replied the station-master. \"Still, I wouldn't say it is impossible.\"\n\"Thank you. Oh, and there's another question. You have a gang of men at work on the line, I see. Now, do those men belong to the district?\"\n\"No, sir; they are strangers, every one, and pretty rough diamonds some of 'em are. But I shouldn't say there was any real harm in 'em. If you was suspecting any of 'em of being mixed up in this—\"\n\"I am not,\" interrupted Thorndyke rather shortly. \"I suspect nobody; but I wish to get all the facts of the case at the outset.\"\n\"Naturally, sir,\" replied the abashed official; and we pursued our way in silence.\n\"Do you remember, by the way,\" said Thorndyke, as we approached the empty coach, \"whether the off-side door of the compartment was closed and locked when the body was discovered?\"\n\"It was closed, sir, but not locked. Why, sir, did you think—?\"\n\"Nothing, nothing. The sealed compartment is the one, of course?\"\nWithout waiting for a reply, he commenced his survey of the coach, while I gently restrained our two companions from shadowing him, as they were disposed to do. The off-side footboard occupied his attention specially, and when he had scrutinized minutely the part opposite the fatal compartment, he walked slowly from end to end with his eyes but a few inches from its surface, as though he was searching for something.\nNear what had been the rear end he stopped, and drew from his pocket a piece of paper; then, with a moistened finger-tip he picked up from the footboard some evidently minute object, which he carefully transferred to the paper, folding the latter and placing it in his pocket-book.\nHe next mounted the footboard, and, having peered in through the window of the sealed compartment, produced from his pocket a small insufflator or powder-blower, with which he blew a stream of impalpable smoke-like powder on to the edges of the middle window, bestowing the closest attention on the irregular dusty patches in which it settled, and even measuring one on the jamb of the window with a pocket-rule. At length he stepped down, and, having carefully looked over the near-side footboard, announced that he had finished for the present.\nAs we were returning down the line, we passed a working man, who seemed to be viewing the chairs and sleepers with more than casual interest.\n\"That, I suppose, is one of the plate-layers?\" Thorndyke suggested to the station-master.\n\"Yes, the foreman of the gang,\" was the reply.\n\"I'll just step back and have a word with him, if you will walk on slowly.\" And my colleague turned back briskly and overtook the man, with whom he remained in conversation for some minutes.\n\"I think I see the police inspector on the platform,\" remarked Thorndyke, as we approached the station.\n\"Yes, there he is,\" said our guide. \"Come down to see what you are after, sir, I expect.\" Which was doubtless the case, although the officer professed to be there by the merest chance.\n\"You would like to see the weapon, sir, I suppose?\" he remarked, when he had introduced himself.\n\"The umbrella-spike,\" Thorndyke corrected. \"Yes, if I may. We are going to the mortuary now.\"\n\"Then you'll pass the station on the way; so, if you care to look in, I will walk up with you.\"\nThis proposition being agreed to, we all proceeded to the police-station, including the station-master, who was on the very tiptoe of curiosity.\n\"There you are, sir,\" said the inspector, unlocking his office, and ushering us in. \"Don't say we haven't given every facility to the defence. There are all the effects of the accused, including the very weapon the deed was done with.\"\n\"Come, come,\" protested Thorndyke; \"we mustn't be premature.\" He took the stout ash staff from the officer, and, having examined the formidable spike through a lens, drew from his pocket a steel calliper-gauge, with which he carefully measured the diameter of the spike, and the staff to which it was fixed. \"And now,\" he said, when he had made a note of the measurements in his book, \"we will look at the colour-box and the sketch. Ha! a very orderly man, your brother. Mr. Stopford. Tubes all in their places, palette-knives wiped clean, palette cleaned off and rubbed bright, brushes wiped—they ought to be washed before they stiffen—all this is very significant.\" He unstrapped the sketch from the blank canvas to which it was pinned, and, standing it on a chair in a good light, stepped back to look at it.\n\"And you tell me that that is only three hours' work!\" he exclaimed, looking at the lawyer. \"It is really a marvellous achievement.\"\n\"My brother is a very rapid worker,\" replied Stopford dejectedly.\n\"Yes, but this is not only amazingly rapid; it is in his very happiest vein—full of spirit and feeling. But we mustn't stay to look at it longer.\" He replaced the canvas on its pins, and having glanced at the locket and some other articles that lay in a drawer, thanked the inspector for his courtesy and withdrew.\n\"That sketch and the colour-box appear very suggestive to me,\" he remarked, as we walked up the street.\n\"To me also,\" said Stopford gloomily, \"for they are under lock and key, like their owner, poor old fellow.\"\nHe sighed heavily, and we walked on in silence.\nThe mortuary-keeper had evidently heard of our arrival, for he was waiting at the door with the key in his hand, and, on being shown the coroner's order, unlocked the door, and we entered together; but, after a momentary glance at the ghostly, shrouded figure lying upon the slate table, Stopford turned pale and retreated, saying that he would wait for us outside with the mortuary-keeper.\nAs soon as the door was closed and locked on the inside, Thorndyke glanced curiously round the bare, whitewashed building. A stream of sunlight poured in through the skylight, and fell upon the silent form that lay so still under its covering-sheet, and one stray beam glanced into a corner by the door, where, on a row of pegs and a deal table, the dead woman's clothing was displayed.\n\"There is something unspeakably sad in these poor relics, Jervis,\" said Thorndyke, as we stood before them. \"To me they are more tragic, more full of pathetic suggestion, than the corpse itself. See the smart, jaunty hat, and the costly skirts hanging there, so desolate and forlorn; the dainty lingerie on the table, neatly folded—by the mortuary-man's wife, I hope—the little French shoes and open-work silk stockings. How pathetically eloquent they are of harmless, womanly vanity, and the gay, careless life, snapped short in the twinkling of an eye. But we must not give way to sentiment. There is another life threatened, and it is in our keeping.\"\nHe lifted the hat from its peg, and turned it over in his hand. It was, I think, what is called a \"picture-hat\"—a huge, flat, shapeless mass of gauze and ribbon and feather, spangled over freely with dark-blue sequins. In one part of the brim was a ragged hole, and from this the glittering sequins dropped off in little showers when the hat was moved.\n\"This will have been worn tilted over on the left side,\" said Thorndyke, \"judging by the general shape and the position of the hole.\"\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"Like that of the Duchess of Devonshire in Gainsborough's portrait.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nHe shook a few of the sequins into the palm of his hand, and, replacing the hat on its peg, dropped the little discs into an envelope, on which he wrote, \"From the hat,\" and slipped it into his pocket. Then, stepping over to the table, he drew back the sheet reverently and even tenderly from the dead woman's face, and looked down at it with grave pity. It was a comely face, white as marble, serene and peaceful in expression, with half-closed eyes, and framed with a mass of brassy, yellow hair; but its beauty was marred by a long linear wound, half cut, half bruise, running down the right cheek from the eye to the chin.\n\"A handsome girl,\" Thorndyke commented—\"a dark-haired blonde. What a sin to have disfigured herself so with that horrible peroxide.\" He smoothed the hair back from her forehead, and added: \"She seems to have applied the stuff last about ten days ago. There is about a quarter of an inch of dark hair at the roots. What do you make of that wound on the cheek?\"\n\"It looks as if she had struck some sharp angle in falling, though, as the seats are padded in first-class carriages, I don't see what she could have struck.\"\n\"No. And now let us look at the other wound. Will you note down the description?\" He handed me his notebook, and I wrote down as he dictated: \"A clean-punched circular hole in skull, an inch behind and above margin of left ear—diameter, an inch and seven-sixteenths; starred fracture of parietal bone; membranes perforated, and brain entered deeply; ragged scalp-wound, extending forward to margin of left orbit; fragments of gauze and sequins in edges of wound. That will do for the present. Dr. Morton will give us further details if we want them.\"\nHe pocketed his callipers and rule, drew from the bruised scalp one or two loose hairs, which he placed in the envelope with the sequins, and, having looked over the body for other wounds or bruises (of which there were none), replaced the sheet, and prepared to depart.\nAs we walked away from the mortuary, Thorndyke was silent and deeply thoughtful, and I gathered that he was piecing together the facts that he had acquired. At length Mr. Stopford, who had several times looked at him curiously, said:\n\"The post-mortem will take place at three, and it is now only half-past eleven. What would you like to do next?\"\nThorndyke, who, in spite of his mental preoccupation, had been looking about him in his usual keen, attentive way, halted suddenly.\n\"Your reference to the post-mortem,\" said he, \"reminds me that I forgot to put the ox-gall into my case.\"\n\"Ox-gall!\" I exclaimed, endeavouring vainly to connect this substance with the technique of the pathologist. \"What were you going to do with—\"\nBut here I broke off, remembering my friend's dislike of any discussion of his methods before strangers.\n\"I suppose,\" he continued, \"there would hardly be an artist's colourman in a place of this size?\"\n\"I should think not,\" said Stopford. \"But couldn't you got the stuff from a butcher? There's a shop just across the road.\"\n\"So there is,\" agreed Thorndyke, who had already observed the shop. \"The gall ought, of course, to be prepared, but we can filter it ourselves—that is, if the butcher has any. We will try him, at any rate.\"\nHe crossed the road towards the shop, over which the name \"Felton\" appeared in gilt lettering, and, addressing himself to the proprietor, who stood at the door, introduced himself and explained his wants.\n\"Ox-gall?\" said the butcher. \"No, sir, I haven't any just now; but I am having a beast killed this afternoon, and I can let you have some then. In fact,\" he added, after a pause, \"as the matter is of importance, I can have one killed at once if you wish it.\"\n\"That is very kind of you,\" said Thorndyke, \"and it would greatly oblige me. Is the beast perfectly healthy?\"\n\"They're in splendid condition, sir. I picked them out of the herd myself. But you shall see them—ay, and choose the one that you'd like killed.\"\n\"You are really very good,\" said Thorndyke warmly. \"I will just run into the chemist's next door, and get a suitable bottle, and then I will avail myself of your exceedingly kind offer.\"\nHe hurried into the chemist's shop, from which he presently emerged, carrying a white paper parcel; and we then followed the butcher down a narrow lane by the side of his shop. It led to an enclosure containing a small pen, in which were confined three handsome steers, whose glossy, black coats contrasted in a very striking manner with their long, greyish-white, nearly straight horns.\n\"These are certainly very fine beasts, Mr. Felton,\" said Thorndyke, as we drew up beside the pen, \"and in excellent condition, too.\"\nHe leaned over the pen and examined the beasts critically, especially as to their eyes and horns; then, approaching the nearest one, he raised his stick and bestowed a smart tap on the under-side of the right horn, following it by a similar tap on the left one, a proceeding that the beast viewed with stolid surprise.\n\"The state of the horns,\" explained Thorndyke, as he moved on to the next steer, \"enables one to judge, to some extent, of the beast's health.\"\n\"Lord bless you, sir,\" laughed Mr. Felton, \"they haven't got no feeling in their horns, else what good 'ud their horns be to 'em?\"\nApparently he was right, for the second steer was as indifferent to a sounding rap on either horn as the first. Nevertheless, when Thorndyke approached the third steer, I unconsciously drew nearer to watch; and I noticed that, as the stick struck the horn, the beast drew back in evident alarm, and that when the blow was repeated, it became manifestly uneasy.\n\"He don't seem to like that,\" said the butcher. \"Seems as if—Hullo, that's queer!\"\nThorndyke had just brought his stick up against the left horn, and immediately the beast had winced and started back, shaking his head and moaning. There was not, however, room for him to back out of reach, and Thorndyke, by leaning into the pen, was able to inspect the sensitive horn, which he did with the closest attention, while the butcher looked on with obvious perturbation.\n\"You don't think there's anything wrong with this beast, sir, I hope,\" said he.\n\"I can't say without a further examination,\" replied Thorndyke. \"It may be the horn only that is affected. If you will have it sawn off close to the head, and sent up to me at the hotel, I will look at it and tell you. And, by way of preventing any mistakes, I will mark it and cover it up, to protect it from injury in the slaughter-house.\"\nHe opened his parcel and produced from it a wide-mouthed bottle labelled \"Ox-gall,\" a sheet of gutta-percha tissue, a roller bandage, and a stick of sealing-wax. Handing the bottle to Mr. Felton, he encased the distal half of the horn in a covering by means of the tissue and the bandage, which he fixed securely with the sealing-wax.\n\"I'll saw the horn off and bring it up to the hotel myself, with the ox-gall,\" said Mr. Felton. \"You shall have them in half an hour.\"\nHe was as good as his word, for in half an hour Thorndyke was seated at a small table by the window of our private sitting-room in the Black Bull Hotel. The table was covered with newspaper, and on it lay the long grey horn and Thorndyke's travelling-case, now open and displaying a small microscope and its accessories. The butcher was seated solidly in an armchair waiting, with a half-suspicious eye on Thorndyke for the report; and I was endeavouring by cheerful talk to keep Mr. Stopford from sinking into utter despondency, though I, too, kept a furtive watch on my colleague's rather mysterious proceedings.\nI saw him unwind the bandage and apply the horn to his ear, bending it slightly to and fro. I watched him, as he scanned the surface closely through a lens, and observed him as he scraped some substance from the pointed end on to a glass slide, and, having applied a drop of some reagent, began to tease out the scraping with a pair of mounted needles. Presently he placed the slide under the microscope, and, having observed it attentively for a minute or two, turned round sharply.\n\"Come and look at this, Jervis,\" said he.\nI wanted no second bidding, being on tenterhooks of curiosity, but came over and applied my eye to the instrument.\n\"Well, what is it?\" he asked.\n\"A multipolar nerve corpuscle—very shrivelled, but unmistakable.\"\n\"And this?\"\nHe moved the slide to a fresh spot.\n\"Two pyramidal nerve corpuscles and some portions of fibres.\"\n\"And what do you say the tissue is?\"\n\"Cortical brain substance, I should say, without a doubt.\"\n\"I entirely agree with you. And that being so,\" he added, turning to Mr. Stopford, \"we may say that the case for the defence is practically complete.\"\n\"What, in Heaven's name, do you mean?\" exclaimed Stopford, starting up.\n",
      "prompt": "Summarize the following document for Detective story 'The Blue Sequin' by Unknown. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\nThorndyke stood looking up and down the platform with anxiety that increased as the time drew near for the departure of the train.\n\"This is very unfortunate,\" he said, reluctantly stepping into an empty smoking compartment as the guard executed a flourish with his green flag. \"I am afraid we have missed our friend.\" He closed the door, and, as the train began to move, thrust his head out of the window.\n\"Now I wonder if that will be he,\" he continued. \"If so, he has caught the train by the skin of his teeth, and is now in one of the rear compartments.\"\nThe subject of Thorndyke's speculations was Mr. Edward Stopford, of the firm of Stopford and Myers, of Portugal Street, solicitors, and his connection with us at present arose out of a telegram that had reached our chambers on the preceding evening. It was reply-paid, and ran thus:\n\"Can you come here to-morrow to direct defence? Important case. All costs undertaken by us.—STOPFORD AND MYERS.\"\nThorndyke's reply had been in the affirmative, and early on this present morning a further telegram—evidently posted overnight—had been delivered:\n\"Shall leave for Woldhurst by 8.25 from Charing Cross. Will call for you if possible.—EDWARD STOPFORD.\"\nHe had not called, however, and, since he was unknown personally to us both, we could not judge whether or not he had been among the passengers on the platform.\n\"It is most unfortunate,\" Thorndyke repeated, \"for it deprives us of that preliminary consideration of the case which is so invaluable.\" He filled his pipe thoughtfully, and, having made a fruitless inspection of the platform at London Bridge, took up the paper that he had bought at the bookstall, and began to turn over the leaves, running his eye quickly down the columns, unmindful of the journalistic baits in paragraph or article.\n\"It is a great disadvantage,\" he observed, while still glancing through the paper, \"to come plump into an inquiry without preparation—to be confronted with the details before one has a chance of considering the case in general terms. For instance—\"\nHe paused, leaving the sentence unfinished, and as I looked up inquiringly I saw that he had turned over another page, and was now reading attentively.\n\"This looks like our case, Jervis,\" he said presently, handing me the paper and indicating a paragraph at the top of the page. It was quite brief, and was headed \"Terrible Murder in Kent,\" the account being as follows:\n\"A shocking crime was discovered yesterday morning at the little town of Woldhurst, which lies on the branch line from Halbury Junction. The discovery was made by a porter who was inspecting the carriages of the train which had just come in. On opening the door of a first-class compartment, he was horrified to find the body of a fashionably-dressed woman stretched upon the floor. Medical aid was immediately summoned, and on the arrival of the divisional surgeon, Dr. Morton, it was ascertained that the woman had not been dead more than a few minutes.\n\"The state of the corpse leaves no doubt that a murder of a most brutal kind has been perpetrated, the cause of death being a penetrating wound of the head, inflicted with some pointed implement, which must have been used with terrible violence, since it has perforated the skull and entered the brain. That robbery was not the motive of the crime is made clear by the fact that an expensively fitted dressing-bag was found on the rack, and that the dead woman's jewellery, including several valuable diamond rings, was untouched. It is rumoured that an arrest has been made by the local police.\"\n\"A gruesome affair,\" I remarked, as I handed back the paper, \"but the report does not give us much information.\"\n\"It does not,\" Thorndyke agreed, \"and yet it gives us something to consider. Here is a perforating wound of the skull, inflicted with some pointed implement—that is, assuming that it is not a bullet wound. Now, what kind of implement would be capable of inflicting such an injury? How would such an implement be used in the confined space of a railway-carriage, and what sort of person would be in possession of such an implement? These are preliminary questions that are worth considering, and I commend them to you, together with the further problems of the possible motive—excluding robbery—and any circumstances other than murder which might account for the injury.\"\n\"The choice of suitable implements is not very great,\" I observed.\n\"It is very limited, and most of them, such as a plasterer's pick or a geological hammer, are associated with certain definite occupations. You have a notebook?\"\nI had, and, accepting the hint, I produced it and pursued my further reflections in silence, while my companion, with his notebook also on his knee, gazed steadily out of the window. And thus he remained, wrapped in thought, jotting down an entry now and again in his book, until the train slowed down at Halbury Junction, where we had to change on to a branch line.\nAs we stepped out, I noticed a well-dressed man hurrying up the platform from the rear and eagerly scanning the faces of the few passengers who had alighted. Soon he espied us, and, approaching quickly, asked, as he looked from one of us to the other:\n\"Dr. Thorndyke?\"\n\"Yes,\" replied my colleague, adding: \"And you, I presume, are Mr. Edward Stopford?\"\nThe solicitor bowed. \"This is a dreadful affair,\" he said, in an agitated manner. \"I see you have the paper. A most shocking affair. I am immensely relieved to find you here. Nearly missed the train, and feared I should miss you.\"\n\"There appears to have been an arrest,\" Thorndyke began.\n\"Yes—my brother. Terrible business. Let us walk up the platform; our train won't start for a quarter of an hour yet.\"\nWe deposited our joint Gladstone and Thorndyke's travelling-case in an empty first-class compartment, and then, with the solicitor between us, strolled up to the unfrequented end of the platform.\n\"My brother's position,\" said Mr. Stopford, \"fills me with dismay—but let me give you the facts in order, and you shall judge for yourself. This poor creature who has been murdered so brutally was a Miss Edith Grant. She was formerly an artist's model, and as such was a good deal employed by my brother, who is a painter—Harold Stopford, you know, A.R.A. now—\"\n\"I know his work very well, and charming work it is.\"\n\"I think so, too. Well, in those days he was quite a youngster—about twenty—and he became very intimate with Miss Grant, in quite an innocent way, though not very discreet; but she was a nice respectable girl, as most English models are, and no one thought any harm. However, a good many letters passed between them, and some little presents, amongst which was a beaded chain carrying a locket, and in this he was fool enough to put his portrait and the inscription, 'Edith, from Harold.'\n\"Later on Miss Grant, who had a rather good voice, went on the stage, in the comic opera line, and, in consequence, her habits and associates changed somewhat; and, as Harold had meanwhile become engaged, he was naturally anxious to get his letters back, and especially to exchange the locket for some less compromising gift. The letters she eventually sent him, but refused absolutely to part with the locket.\n\"Now, for the last month Harold has been staying at Halbury, making sketching excursions into the surrounding country, and yesterday morning he took the train to Shinglehurst, the third station from here, and the one before Woldhurst.\n\"On the platform here he met Miss Grant, who had come down from London, and was going on to Worthing. They entered the branch train together, having a first-class compartment to themselves. It seems she was wearing his locket at the time, and he made another appeal to her to make an exchange, which she refused, as before. The discussion appears to have become rather heated and angry on both sides, for the guard and a porter at Munsden both noticed that they seemed to be quarrelling; but the upshot of the affair was that the lady snapped the chain, and tossed it together with the locket to my brother, and they parted quite amiably at Shinglehurst, where Harold got out. He was then carrying his full sketching kit, including a large holland umbrella, the lower joint of which is an ash staff fitted with a powerful steel spike for driving into the ground.\n\"It was about half-past ten when he got out at Shinglehurst; by eleven he had reached his pitch and got to work, and he painted steadily for three hours. Then he packed up his traps, and was just starting on his way back to the station, when he was met by the police and arrested.\n\"And now, observe the accumulation of circumstantial evidence against him. He was the last person seen in company with the murdered woman—for no one seems to have seen her after they left Munsden; he appeared to be quarrelling with her when she was last seen alive, he had a reason for possibly wishing for her death, he was provided with an implement—a spiked staff—capable of inflicting the injury which caused her death, and, when he was searched, there was found in his possession the locket and broken chain, apparently removed from her person with violence.\n\"Against all this is, of course, his known character—he is the gentlest and most amiable of men—and his subsequent conduct—imbecile to the last degree if he had been guilty; but, as a lawyer, I can't help seeing that appearances are almost hopelessly against him.\"\n\"We won't say 'hopelessly,'\" replied Thorndyke, as we took our places in the carriage, \"though I expect the police are pretty cocksure. When does the inquest open?\"\n\"To-day at four. I have obtained an order from the coroner for you to examine the body and be present at the post-mortem.\"\n\"Do you happen to know the exact position of the wound?\"\n\"Yes; it is a little above and behind the left ear—a horrible round hole, with a ragged cut or tear running from it to the side of the forehead.\"\n\"And how was the body lying?\"\n\"Right along the floor, with the feet close to the off-side door.\"\n\"Was the wound on the head the only one?\"\n\"No; there was a long cut or bruise on the right cheek—a contused wound the police surgeon called it, which he believes to have been inflicted with a heavy and rather blunt weapon. I have not heard of any other wounds or bruises.\"\n\"Did anyone enter the train yesterday at Shinglehurst?\" Thorndyke asked.\n\"No one entered the train after it left Halbury.\"\nThorndyke considered these statements in silence, and presently fell into a brown study, from which he roused only as the train moved out of Shinglehurst station.\n\"It would be about here that the murder was committed,\" said Mr. Stopford; \"at least, between here and Woldhurst.\"\nThorndyke nodded rather abstractedly, being engaged at the moment in observing with great attention the objects that were visible from the windows.\n\"I notice,\" he remarked presently, \"a number of chips scattered about between the rails, and some of the chair-wedges look new. Have there been any platelayers at work lately?\"\n\"Yes,\" answered Stopford, \"they are on the line now, I believe—at least, I saw a gang working near Woldhurst yesterday, and they are said to have set a rick on fire; I saw it smoking when I came down.\"\n\"Indeed; and this middle line of rails is, I suppose, a sort of siding?\"\n\"Yes; they shunt the goods trains and empty trucks on to it. There are the remains of the rick—still smouldering, you see.\"\nThorndyke gazed absently at the blackened heap until an empty cattle-truck on the middle track hid it from view. This was succeeded by a line of goods-waggons, and these by a passenger coach, one compartment of which—a first-class—was closed up and sealed. The train now began to slow down rather suddenly, and a couple of minutes later we brought up in Woldhurst station.\nIt was evident that rumours of Thorndyke's advent had preceded us, for the entire staff—two porters, an inspector, and the station-master—were waiting expectantly on the platform, and the latter came forward, regardless of his dignity, to help us with our luggage.\n\"Do you think I could see the carriage?\" Thorndyke asked the solicitor.\n\"Not the inside, sir,\" said the station-master, on being appealed to. \"The police have sealed it up. You would have to ask the inspector.\"\n\"Well, I can have a look at the outside, I suppose?\" said Thorndyke, and to this the station-master readily agreed, and offered to accompany us.\n\"What other first-class passengers were there?\" Thorndyke asked.\n\"None, sir. There was only one first-class coach, and the deceased was the only person in it. It has given us all a dreadful turn, this affair has,\" he continued, as we set off up the line. \"I was on the platform when the train came in. We were watching a rick that was burning up the line, and a rare blaze it made, too; and I was just saying that we should have to move the cattle-truck that was on the mid-track, because, you see, sir, the smoke and sparks were blowing across, and I thought it would frighten the poor beasts. And Mr. Felton he don't like his beasts handled roughly. He says it spoils the meat.\"\n\"No doubt he is right,\" said Thorndyke. \"But now, tell me, do you think it is possible for any person to board or leave the train on the off-side unobserved? Could a man, for instance, enter a compartment on the off-side at one station and drop off as the train was slowing down at the next, without being seen?\"\n\"I doubt it,\" replied the station-master. \"Still, I wouldn't say it is impossible.\"\n\"Thank you. Oh, and there's another question. You have a gang of men at work on the line, I see. Now, do those men belong to the district?\"\n\"No, sir; they are strangers, every one, and pretty rough diamonds some of 'em are. But I shouldn't say there was any real harm in 'em. If you was suspecting any of 'em of being mixed up in this—\"\n\"I am not,\" interrupted Thorndyke rather shortly. \"I suspect nobody; but I wish to get all the facts of the case at the outset.\"\n\"Naturally, sir,\" replied the abashed official; and we pursued our way in silence.\n\"Do you remember, by the way,\" said Thorndyke, as we approached the empty coach, \"whether the off-side door of the compartment was closed and locked when the body was discovered?\"\n\"It was closed, sir, but not locked. Why, sir, did you think—?\"\n\"Nothing, nothing. The sealed compartment is the one, of course?\"\nWithout waiting for a reply, he commenced his survey of the coach, while I gently restrained our two companions from shadowing him, as they were disposed to do. The off-side footboard occupied his attention specially, and when he had scrutinized minutely the part opposite the fatal compartment, he walked slowly from end to end with his eyes but a few inches from its surface, as though he was searching for something.\nNear what had been the rear end he stopped, and drew from his pocket a piece of paper; then, with a moistened finger-tip he picked up from the footboard some evidently minute object, which he carefully transferred to the paper, folding the latter and placing it in his pocket-book.\nHe next mounted the footboard, and, having peered in through the window of the sealed compartment, produced from his pocket a small insufflator or powder-blower, with which he blew a stream of impalpable smoke-like powder on to the edges of the middle window, bestowing the closest attention on the irregular dusty patches in which it settled, and even measuring one on the jamb of the window with a pocket-rule. At length he stepped down, and, having carefully looked over the near-side footboard, announced that he had finished for the present.\nAs we were returning down the line, we passed a working man, who seemed to be viewing the chairs and sleepers with more than casual interest.\n\"That, I suppose, is one of the plate-layers?\" Thorndyke suggested to the station-master.\n\"Yes, the foreman of the gang,\" was the reply.\n\"I'll just step back and have a word with him, if you will walk on slowly.\" And my colleague turned back briskly and overtook the man, with whom he remained in conversation for some minutes.\n\"I think I see the police inspector on the platform,\" remarked Thorndyke, as we approached the station.\n\"Yes, there he is,\" said our guide. \"Come down to see what you are after, sir, I expect.\" Which was doubtless the case, although the officer professed to be there by the merest chance.\n\"You would like to see the weapon, sir, I suppose?\" he remarked, when he had introduced himself.\n\"The umbrella-spike,\" Thorndyke corrected. \"Yes, if I may. We are going to the mortuary now.\"\n\"Then you'll pass the station on the way; so, if you care to look in, I will walk up with you.\"\nThis proposition being agreed to, we all proceeded to the police-station, including the station-master, who was on the very tiptoe of curiosity.\n\"There you are, sir,\" said the inspector, unlocking his office, and ushering us in. \"Don't say we haven't given every facility to the defence. There are all the effects of the accused, including the very weapon the deed was done with.\"\n\"Come, come,\" protested Thorndyke; \"we mustn't be premature.\" He took the stout ash staff from the officer, and, having examined the formidable spike through a lens, drew from his pocket a steel calliper-gauge, with which he carefully measured the diameter of the spike, and the staff to which it was fixed. \"And now,\" he said, when he had made a note of the measurements in his book, \"we will look at the colour-box and the sketch. Ha! a very orderly man, your brother. Mr. Stopford. Tubes all in their places, palette-knives wiped clean, palette cleaned off and rubbed bright, brushes wiped—they ought to be washed before they stiffen—all this is very significant.\" He unstrapped the sketch from the blank canvas to which it was pinned, and, standing it on a chair in a good light, stepped back to look at it.\n\"And you tell me that that is only three hours' work!\" he exclaimed, looking at the lawyer. \"It is really a marvellous achievement.\"\n\"My brother is a very rapid worker,\" replied Stopford dejectedly.\n\"Yes, but this is not only amazingly rapid; it is in his very happiest vein—full of spirit and feeling. But we mustn't stay to look at it longer.\" He replaced the canvas on its pins, and having glanced at the locket and some other articles that lay in a drawer, thanked the inspector for his courtesy and withdrew.\n\"That sketch and the colour-box appear very suggestive to me,\" he remarked, as we walked up the street.\n\"To me also,\" said Stopford gloomily, \"for they are under lock and key, like their owner, poor old fellow.\"\nHe sighed heavily, and we walked on in silence.\nThe mortuary-keeper had evidently heard of our arrival, for he was waiting at the door with the key in his hand, and, on being shown the coroner's order, unlocked the door, and we entered together; but, after a momentary glance at the ghostly, shrouded figure lying upon the slate table, Stopford turned pale and retreated, saying that he would wait for us outside with the mortuary-keeper.\nAs soon as the door was closed and locked on the inside, Thorndyke glanced curiously round the bare, whitewashed building. A stream of sunlight poured in through the skylight, and fell upon the silent form that lay so still under its covering-sheet, and one stray beam glanced into a corner by the door, where, on a row of pegs and a deal table, the dead woman's clothing was displayed.\n\"There is something unspeakably sad in these poor relics, Jervis,\" said Thorndyke, as we stood before them. \"To me they are more tragic, more full of pathetic suggestion, than the corpse itself. See the smart, jaunty hat, and the costly skirts hanging there, so desolate and forlorn; the dainty lingerie on the table, neatly folded—by the mortuary-man's wife, I hope—the little French shoes and open-work silk stockings. How pathetically eloquent they are of harmless, womanly vanity, and the gay, careless life, snapped short in the twinkling of an eye. But we must not give way to sentiment. There is another life threatened, and it is in our keeping.\"\nHe lifted the hat from its peg, and turned it over in his hand. It was, I think, what is called a \"picture-hat\"—a huge, flat, shapeless mass of gauze and ribbon and feather, spangled over freely with dark-blue sequins. In one part of the brim was a ragged hole, and from this the glittering sequins dropped off in little showers when the hat was moved.\n\"This will have been worn tilted over on the left side,\" said Thorndyke, \"judging by the general shape and the position of the hole.\"\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"Like that of the Duchess of Devonshire in Gainsborough's portrait.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nHe shook a few of the sequins into the palm of his hand, and, replacing the hat on its peg, dropped the little discs into an envelope, on which he wrote, \"From the hat,\" and slipped it into his pocket. Then, stepping over to the table, he drew back the sheet reverently and even tenderly from the dead woman's face, and looked down at it with grave pity. It was a comely face, white as marble, serene and peaceful in expression, with half-closed eyes, and framed with a mass of brassy, yellow hair; but its beauty was marred by a long linear wound, half cut, half bruise, running down the right cheek from the eye to the chin.\n\"A handsome girl,\" Thorndyke commented—\"a dark-haired blonde. What a sin to have disfigured herself so with that horrible peroxide.\" He smoothed the hair back from her forehead, and added: \"She seems to have applied the stuff last about ten days ago. There is about a quarter of an inch of dark hair at the roots. What do you make of that wound on the cheek?\"\n\"It looks as if she had struck some sharp angle in falling, though, as the seats are padded in first-class carriages, I don't see what she could have struck.\"\n\"No. And now let us look at the other wound. Will you note down the description?\" He handed me his notebook, and I wrote down as he dictated: \"A clean-punched circular hole in skull, an inch behind and above margin of left ear—diameter, an inch and seven-sixteenths; starred fracture of parietal bone; membranes perforated, and brain entered deeply; ragged scalp-wound, extending forward to margin of left orbit; fragments of gauze and sequins in edges of wound. That will do for the present. Dr. Morton will give us further details if we want them.\"\nHe pocketed his callipers and rule, drew from the bruised scalp one or two loose hairs, which he placed in the envelope with the sequins, and, having looked over the body for other wounds or bruises (of which there were none), replaced the sheet, and prepared to depart.\nAs we walked away from the mortuary, Thorndyke was silent and deeply thoughtful, and I gathered that he was piecing together the facts that he had acquired. At length Mr. Stopford, who had several times looked at him curiously, said:\n\"The post-mortem will take place at three, and it is now only half-past eleven. What would you like to do next?\"\nThorndyke, who, in spite of his mental preoccupation, had been looking about him in his usual keen, attentive way, halted suddenly.\n\"Your reference to the post-mortem,\" said he, \"reminds me that I forgot to put the ox-gall into my case.\"\n\"Ox-gall!\" I exclaimed, endeavouring vainly to connect this substance with the technique of the pathologist. \"What were you going to do with—\"\nBut here I broke off, remembering my friend's dislike of any discussion of his methods before strangers.\n\"I suppose,\" he continued, \"there would hardly be an artist's colourman in a place of this size?\"\n\"I should think not,\" said Stopford. \"But couldn't you got the stuff from a butcher? There's a shop just across the road.\"\n\"So there is,\" agreed Thorndyke, who had already observed the shop. \"The gall ought, of course, to be prepared, but we can filter it ourselves—that is, if the butcher has any. We will try him, at any rate.\"\nHe crossed the road towards the shop, over which the name \"Felton\" appeared in gilt lettering, and, addressing himself to the proprietor, who stood at the door, introduced himself and explained his wants.\n\"Ox-gall?\" said the butcher. \"No, sir, I haven't any just now; but I am having a beast killed this afternoon, and I can let you have some then. In fact,\" he added, after a pause, \"as the matter is of importance, I can have one killed at once if you wish it.\"\n\"That is very kind of you,\" said Thorndyke, \"and it would greatly oblige me. Is the beast perfectly healthy?\"\n\"They're in splendid condition, sir. I picked them out of the herd myself. But you shall see them—ay, and choose the one that you'd like killed.\"\n\"You are really very good,\" said Thorndyke warmly. \"I will just run into the chemist's next door, and get a suitable bottle, and then I will avail myself of your exceedingly kind offer.\"\nHe hurried into the chemist's shop, from which he presently emerged, carrying a white paper parcel; and we then followed the butcher down a narrow lane by the side of his shop. It led to an enclosure containing a small pen, in which were confined three handsome steers, whose glossy, black coats contrasted in a very striking manner with their long, greyish-white, nearly straight horns.\n\"These are certainly very fine beasts, Mr. Felton,\" said Thorndyke, as we drew up beside the pen, \"and in excellent condition, too.\"\nHe leaned over the pen and examined the beasts critically, especially as to their eyes and horns; then, approaching the nearest one, he raised his stick and bestowed a smart tap on the under-side of the right horn, following it by a similar tap on the left one, a proceeding that the beast viewed with stolid surprise.\n\"The state of the horns,\" explained Thorndyke, as he moved on to the next steer, \"enables one to judge, to some extent, of the beast's health.\"\n\"Lord bless you, sir,\" laughed Mr. Felton, \"they haven't got no feeling in their horns, else what good 'ud their horns be to 'em?\"\nApparently he was right, for the second steer was as indifferent to a sounding rap on either horn as the first. Nevertheless, when Thorndyke approached the third steer, I unconsciously drew nearer to watch; and I noticed that, as the stick struck the horn, the beast drew back in evident alarm, and that when the blow was repeated, it became manifestly uneasy.\n\"He don't seem to like that,\" said the butcher. \"Seems as if—Hullo, that's queer!\"\nThorndyke had just brought his stick up against the left horn, and immediately the beast had winced and started back, shaking his head and moaning. There was not, however, room for him to back out of reach, and Thorndyke, by leaning into the pen, was able to inspect the sensitive horn, which he did with the closest attention, while the butcher looked on with obvious perturbation.\n\"You don't think there's anything wrong with this beast, sir, I hope,\" said he.\n\"I can't say without a further examination,\" replied Thorndyke. \"It may be the horn only that is affected. If you will have it sawn off close to the head, and sent up to me at the hotel, I will look at it and tell you. And, by way of preventing any mistakes, I will mark it and cover it up, to protect it from injury in the slaughter-house.\"\nHe opened his parcel and produced from it a wide-mouthed bottle labelled \"Ox-gall,\" a sheet of gutta-percha tissue, a roller bandage, and a stick of sealing-wax. Handing the bottle to Mr. Felton, he encased the distal half of the horn in a covering by means of the tissue and the bandage, which he fixed securely with the sealing-wax.\n\"I'll saw the horn off and bring it up to the hotel myself, with the ox-gall,\" said Mr. Felton. \"You shall have them in half an hour.\"\nHe was as good as his word, for in half an hour Thorndyke was seated at a small table by the window of our private sitting-room in the Black Bull Hotel. The table was covered with newspaper, and on it lay the long grey horn and Thorndyke's travelling-case, now open and displaying a small microscope and its accessories. The butcher was seated solidly in an armchair waiting, with a half-suspicious eye on Thorndyke for the report; and I was endeavouring by cheerful talk to keep Mr. Stopford from sinking into utter despondency, though I, too, kept a furtive watch on my colleague's rather mysterious proceedings.\nI saw him unwind the bandage and apply the horn to his ear, bending it slightly to and fro. I watched him, as he scanned the surface closely through a lens, and observed him as he scraped some substance from the pointed end on to a glass slide, and, having applied a drop of some reagent, began to tease out the scraping with a pair of mounted needles. Presently he placed the slide under the microscope, and, having observed it attentively for a minute or two, turned round sharply.\n\"Come and look at this, Jervis,\" said he.\nI wanted no second bidding, being on tenterhooks of curiosity, but came over and applied my eye to the instrument.\n\"Well, what is it?\" he asked.\n\"A multipolar nerve corpuscle—very shrivelled, but unmistakable.\"\n\"And this?\"\nHe moved the slide to a fresh spot.\n\"Two pyramidal nerve corpuscles and some portions of fibres.\"\n\"And what do you say the tissue is?\"\n\"Cortical brain substance, I should say, without a doubt.\"\n\"I entirely agree with you. And that being so,\" he added, turning to Mr. Stopford, \"we may say that the case for the defence is practically complete.\"\n\"What, in Heaven's name, do you mean?\" exclaimed Stopford, starting up.\n\n\nProvide a comprehensive summary (between 600 and 900 words long) of the key events, information, and important details from this document."

    "final_summary": "\"The Blue Sequin,\" a detective story involving Dr. Thorndyke and his companion Jervis, unfolds with the discovery of a brutal murder on a train near the small town of Woldhurst. The story begins with Thorndyke anxiously waiting at a train platform, concerned that they have missed meeting Mr. Edward Stopford, a solicitor from the firm Stopford and Myers, who had summoned them urgently to direct the defense in an important case. Stopford had planned to travel to Woldhurst by the 8.25 train from Charing Cross and promised to call for them but failed to do so. Eventually, Stopford barely catches a later train and meets Thorndyke and Jervis at Halbury Junction, where they change to a branch line.\n\nThorndyke laments the lack of preparation, as they directly confront a serious inquiry without prior briefings. He reads a newspaper account of the murder discovered by a railway porter who found a fashionably dressed woman dead in a first-class train compartment. Medical examination reveals the woman had been killed by a penetrating wound to the head, caused by a pointed implement with great force that fractured the skull and entered the brain. The police find robbery is unlikely since the victim’s expensive jewelry and belongings remain untouched. Rumors of an arrest circulate.\n\nEdward Stopford divulges details of his connection to the case: the murdered woman, Edith Grant, was a former artist’s model and acquaintance of his brother, Harold Stopford, an established painter. The two had a complicated personal history, including exchanged letters and gifts, notably a beaded chain with a locket containing Harold’s portrait. Edith refused to return the locket when Harold, now engaged to another, requested its exchange for a less compromising present. \n\nOn the morning of the murder, Harold and Edith boarded the branch line train together; she was traveling to Worthing, and he was heading to Shinglehurst, the stop before Woldhurst. They occupied a first-class compartment alone and were witnessed by railway staff quarrelling. At Shinglehurst, Harold exited the train, carrying his complete sketching kit, including a large holland umbrella with a distinctive lower joint made from ash fitted with a powerful steel spike. Shortly after, police arrested Harold. \n\nCircumstantial evidence mounts against Harold: he was the last person seen with Edith, they argued just prior to her death, and he possessed the potential murder weapon, the umbrella-spike. The broken locket and chain were found in his possession, apparently torn from Edith by force. However, his character is widely known as gentle and amiable, leading Stopford to worry that the evidence is overwhelmingly against him but might be misleading.\n\nThorndyke and the others arrive at Woldhurst, where the murdered woman’s first-class compartment is sealed by the police. The station master informs them no other first-class passengers were aboard and no one boarded after Halbury. Thorndyke investigates the compartment exterior meticulously, paying special attention to the footboards and windows, collecting minute evidence and applying a fine powder to reveal details not visible to the naked eye.\n\nThorndyke also speaks with the local platelayers who were working near the crime scene. These men, strangers to the district and considered rough characters, are not suspected by Thorndyke, who insists on gathering all facts without prejudice.\n\nThe next step is visiting the police station, where the inspector shows them Harold Stopford’s effects, including his painting materials, the umbrella-spike weapon, and the sketch he completed on the morning of the murder. Thorndyke notes the artistic materials are unexpectedly tidy and well cared for, which may be significant. The sketch is remarkable for its speed of execution and quality, possibly indicating Harold’s focused and untroubled state during the time he was painting, conflicting with the idea of guilt.\n\nAt the mortuary, Thorndyke examines Edith Grant’s clothing and personal effects with a touching sense of pathos. Her \"picture hat\" adorned with dark-blue sequins has a ragged hole on the brim, matching the location where the fatal wound was inflicted. Thorndyke collects some fallen sequins and hair from the wound edges for analysis. The victim’s body shows two principal wounds: the fatal circular hole in the skull behind and above the left ear and a contused bruise or cut running down the right cheek, which ethereal padding in the compartment seats cannot easily explain. The disfigurement caused by a peroxide hair treatment is noted, adding a dimension to her appearance. Thorndyke wonders about the mechanics of the injuries and their circumstances within the confined compartment.\n\nAware of the approaching post-mortem examination, Thorndyke realizes he requires ox-gall, a substance used in his forensic techniques to uncover invisible details—a sign of his meticulous and scientific approach to investigation. Finding no ox-gall at the local chemist, he negotiates with the local butcher, Mr. Felton, to have a healthy steer slaughtered immediately to produce a fresh supply. While examining the cattle, Thorndyke discovers one beast has a sensitive and possibly unhealthy horn, which he instructs the butcher to remove and send for microscopic examination.\n\nBack at their hotel, Thorndyke conducts a detailed microscopic analysis of the removed horn, identifying that it contains cortical brain tissue rather than just simple horn material. This result surprises Edward Stopford and Jervis, as it implies that the horn tissue is not normal, and offers a crucial clue that will influence the defense's case and likely exonerate Harold Stopford. Thorndyke declares that the defense’s case is practically complete based on this discovery.\n\nIn summary, \"The Blue Sequin\" presents a complex murder mystery involving a brutal killing on a train, a host of circumstantial evidence pointing to the prime suspect Harold Stopford, and the methodical, scientific investigation led by Dr. Thorndyke. The narrative details the social and emotional context connecting the suspect and victim, the nature of the wounds, and Thorndyke's forensic examination and clever deduction. A mysterious biological anomaly discovered in the supposedly inanimate weapon promises to shift the case dramatically, highlighting the blend of empirical science and detective intuition central to the story.",
