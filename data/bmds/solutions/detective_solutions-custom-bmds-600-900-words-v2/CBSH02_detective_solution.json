    "full_text": "“The Blanched Soldier” recounts a curious and unsettling case presented to Sherlock Holmes by Mr. James M. Dodd, a robust and earnest stockbroker and former Imperial Yeomanry soldier who had recently returned from the Boer War. The narrative is told by Holmes himself, who remarks early on that his friend Dr. Watson’s accounts tend toward the sensational rather than the strictly factual—a fact that motivated Holmes to tell this particular story from his own perspective.\n\nThe case begins in January 1903, shortly after the Boer War had concluded. Holmes was alone at his lodgings, as Watson had recently married and was temporarily absent. Dodd arrived, sunburned from his service in South Africa, with an urgent and perplexing problem concerning his close friend and fellow soldier, Godfrey Emsworth. James M. Dodd explains that Godfrey was the son of Colonel Emsworth, a harsh, intimidating man known for his military discipline and formidable personality.\n\nGodfrey and Dodd had forged a close friendship during their service in the war, sharing hardships and camaraderie for over a year. However, Godfrey had been seriously wounded near Pretoria by an elephant gun, after which communication from him abruptly ceased for more than six months. When the war ended and they returned to England, Dodd sought to contact Godfrey but received a curt reply from Colonel Emsworth. The Colonel claimed that Godfrey had embarked on a year-long world voyage for health reasons and advised against further inquiries. This vague explanation seemed suspicious to Dodd, especially given the known tension between father and son and Godfrey’s spirited nature.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Dodd wrote to Godfrey’s mother, who responded warmly and invited him to visit their family estate, Tuxbury Old Park near Bedford. On arrival, Dodd found the old manor to be a sprawling, ancient, and gloomy dwelling with an air of mystery. The household staff consisted chiefly of the aging butler Ralph and his wife, who had served as Godfrey’s nurse during his youth and was kindly disposed toward him.\n\nDodd quickly learned that Colonel Emsworth was a difficult and stern man. His initial meeting with the Colonel was fraught with tension. The Colonel dismissed Dodd’s story of their friendship, doubted its authenticity despite being shown letters from Godfrey to Dodd, and reiterated that Godfrey was traveling abroad for health reasons. When Dodd pressed for details of the voyage, refusing to relent, the Colonel brusquely warned him to cease making inquiries into their family affairs, emphasizing that the past was a closed matter. Despite this, Dodd resolved to persist.\n\nThat evening, Dodd was approached by the old butler Ralph, who revealed a shocking emotional response when questioned about Godfrey’s fate. Ralph described Godfrey as courageous and beloved but implied something was terribly wrong—his words carried an undertone of despair and hinted at a secret. When Dodd confronted Ralph directly about whether Godfrey was dead, the butler’s anguished reply, “I wish to God he was,” deepened the mystery and filled Dodd with dread.\n\nLater that night, as Dodd sat by the fire in his bedroom, he suddenly saw a ghostly figure—Godfrey himself—pressing a pale, ghastly face against the glass of the garden window. Godfrey’s skin was bleached to a sickly “fish-belly” whiteness, far different from the man Dodd had known. The spectacle was so startling that Godfrey fled into the darkness upon being seen, leaving Dodd to pursue him only to hear the sound of a door shutting somewhere outside the house. Though Dodd searched, he could not find his friend and returned troubled and perplexed.\n\nThe next day, Dodd attempted to snoop around the estate grounds and was drawn to a detached outbuilding that did not seem a typical gardener’s lodge. From there emerged a sharply dressed, brisk little man named Mr. Kent, who appeared surprised by Dodd’s presence and locked the doors behind him suspiciously. Dodd observed that the windows were curtained and shuttered, but noticed signs of life inside, including a warm fire and a small lamp. That night, he returned covertly and peered inside through a crack to see the little man smoking a pipe and a second man sitting near the fire with his back to the window. Dodd was convinced without seeing the face that this was Godfrey, deeply melancholy and withdrawn.\n\nBefore Dodd could act further, Colonel Emsworth appeared suddenly, furious at Dodd’s intrusion and ordering him to leave immediately, even threatening violence if he returned. Dodd declared his intention not to rest until Godfrey was confirmed safe and free, challenging Emsworth’s secrecy. The Colonel’s rage was volcanic, but Dodd stood firm.\n\nHolmes, upon hearing this convoluted account, recognized the case’s essential facts: Godfrey was hidden at home under some mysterious restraint or condition, his health or status obscured by the father’s authoritarian control. The few household servants, especially the strangely behaved butler Ralph and the enigmatic Mr. Kent, added to the puzzle.\n\nHolmes accompanied Dodd back to Tuxbury Old Park with a discreet ally for assistance. Upon arrival, Holmes immediately noticed a faint but distinctive tarry smell emanating from a pair of brown leather gloves left on the hall table by Ralph, an unusual clue. Their wait was brief before Colonel Emsworth stormed in with violent expletives, warning them again to depart or face deadly force. Holmes revealed to the Colonel a piece of evidence — the word “Phossy Jaw” written in his notebook — which evidently struck a nerve and forced him to relent. The Colonel reluctantly agreed to allow them to see Godfrey, acknowledging that events had forced his hand.\n\nThe party proceeded to the detached lodge where Godfrey awaited them. The son looked older, ill, and physically altered — his robust sun-tanned features marred by irregular patches of blanched, pallid skin, lending him a ghastly, sickly appearance. He rejected physical contact from Dodd and spoke with bitterness and melancholy, acknowledging how his condition had warped his life and existence.\n\nThough the story breaks off at this point, it points toward a tragic condition underlying Godfrey’s concealment — likely a chronic illness or deformity, hinted at by the bleached skin and references to “Phossy Jaw,” a serious workplace-related bone disease caused by phosphorus exposure typically in match factory workers. The father’s rigid and secretive demeanor, the isolation of the son in a secluded lodge, and the protective butler’s despair all coalesce into a narrative of concealed suffering and familial shame.\n\nThe case stands out for its combination of military comradeship, mysterious illness, family conflict, and the haunting image of a once-vigorous soldier reduced to a spectral and isolated figure. Holmes’ involvement promises to bring the hidden truths to light through logic, observation, and persistence, highlighting the limits of appearances and the depths of personal tragedy behind outward facades.\n\nIn summary, “The Blanched Soldier” is a haunting detective story centered on the disappearance and mysterious fate of Godfrey Emsworth, a young soldier returned from the Boer War but shrouded in secrecy and physical decline. The investigation traverses the terrain of loyalty, paternal authority, and the social stigma of illness, with Holmes called upon to unravel a poignant and eerie mystery concealed within an ancient English estate.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Identify what the “mystery” really is  \n   •  Godfrey is alive but hidden.  \n   •  His skin is patchily white (“blanched”).  \n   •  A tar-like medicated odour comes from gloves that have been handling ointment.  \n   •  Holmes writes “PHOSSY JAW” simply to shock the Colonel; the smell is not phosphorus but one closely resembling the ichthyol, creosote or tar preparations then rubbed on certain skin diseases.  \n   •  Mr Kent is obviously a physician, not a gaoler.  \n   •  Everything the household does is to keep Godfrey out of sight, not to hurt him.\n\n2. Ask what disease produces patchy pallor, was greatly feared in 1903, required isolation, and was often treated—clandestinely—with tar/ichthyol dressings.  \n   → Leprosy (Hansen’s Disease).  Its bacillus is the real “assailant”.\n\n3. Motive analysis  \n   •  Colonel Emsworth: wishes to spare the family name from scandal and, in his own harsh way, to protect the public from contagion.  \n   •  Ralph & his wife: loyalty; they pity the young master.  \n   •  Mr Kent: purely medical duty.  \n   •  No one wants to injure Godfrey; indeed they are all striving to shield or heal him.\n\n4. Opportunity & physical evidence  \n   •  No sign of poisoning, assault, fraud or any ordinary crime.  \n   •  Only physical “evidence” is the skin lesions and the medicated smell—pointing to an illness, not to an aggressor.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n   If every “suspect” is acting to conceal rather than to harm, then the agent that harmed Godfrey must be impersonal.  The culprit, therefore, is the disease organism that infected him: Mycobacterium leprae.  There is consequently no human criminal; merely a medical tragedy.\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nColonel Emsworth, Mr. Ralph the butler, Mrs. Ralph (the nurse-housekeeper), Mr. Kent (the little doctor), Godfrey Emsworth himself, An unknown assailant, The disease (leprosy)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMycobacterium leprae – the leprosy bacillus (i.e., the disease itself)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1.  Godfrey Emsworth is wounded in South Africa and, while recuperating in a military hospital, contracts leprosy.  \n2.  Fearful of official segregation in a leper colony and of social disgrace, Colonel Emsworth smuggles his son back to Tuxbury Old Park and installs him in a detached lodge.  \n3.  The Colonel engages Dr. Kent, a specialist in skin diseases, to live on the grounds and treat Godfrey with the then-usual tar/ichthyol applications.  Ralph and his wife act as confidential attendants.  \n4.  All correspondence is intercepted; the Colonel tells everyone Godfrey has gone round the world.  \n5.  James M. Dodd, unaware of the illness, comes to visit, senses something amiss, and finally glimpses the pale, altered face of his friend at the window.  \n6.  His snooping forces a confrontation.  Holmes, noting the medicated smell and the behaviour of the household, deduces leprosy.  \n7.  Confronted with Holmes’s deduction, the Colonel capitulates, allowing Dodd to see Godfrey and promising to place him under specialist care at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases.  No crime has been committed beyond an over-zealous—if misguided—paternal attempt at secrecy.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Colonel Emsworth: domineering and secretive but motivated by fear and love, not malice.  He neither injured nor imprisoned Godfrey unlawfully; he kept him on the estate at Godfrey’s own request to avoid compulsory segregation.  \n•  Mr. Kent: a physician giving continuous medical attention; any secrecy he maintained was part of professional confidentiality.  \n•  Ralph and his wife: lifelong servants obeying the family and caring for Godfrey; their grief shows they are not perpetrators.  \n•  Godfrey Emsworth: victim, not villain.  \n•  No unknown assailant exists; the only “attack” came from infection in South Africa.  \nThus, every human “suspect” is exonerated; the only true culprit is the disease itself.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "text": "The ideas of my friend Watson, though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own. Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures. “Try it yourself, Holmes!” he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader. The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection, though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take this opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances. A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closed book, is indeed an ideal helpmate.\nI find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War, that I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I can recall in our association. I was alone.\nIt is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them. Mr. James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview. I did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions.\n“From South Africa, sir, I perceive.”\n“Yes, sir,” he answered, with some surprise.\n“Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy.”\n“Exactly.”\n“Middlesex Corps, no doubt.”\n“That is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.”\nI smiled at his bewildered expression.\n“When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. You wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. You have the cut of a riding-man. As to Middlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street. What other regiment would you join?”\n“You see everything.”\n“I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park?”\n“Mr. Holmes—!”\n“My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred.”\n“Yes, indeed. But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since then. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out—”\n“Kicked you out!”\n“Well, that was what it amounted to. He is a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. I couldn't have stuck the colonel if it had not been for Godfrey's sake.”\nI lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair.\n“Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about.”\nMy client grinned mischievously.\n“I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told,” said he. “But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean. I've been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible does it become.\n“When I joined up in January, 1901—just two years ago—young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron. He was Colonel Emsworth's only son—Emsworth, the Crimean V. C.—and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. There was not a finer lad in the regiment. We formed a friendship—the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. He was my mate—and that means a good deal in the Army. We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. I got one letter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from Southampton. Since then not a word—not one word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal.\n“Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back for a year. That was all.\n“I wasn't satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was a good lad, and he would not drop a pal like that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No, I wasn't satisfied, and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter. It happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years' absence, and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey's case again. But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through.”\nMr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke.\n“Well, what have you done?” I asked.\n“My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother, therefore—I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father—and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. That was what took me down on Monday.\n“Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible—five miles from anywhere. There was no trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suitcase, and it was nearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery. There was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house, and there was his wife, who might have been older. She had been Godfrey's nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The mother I liked also—a gentle little white mouse of a woman. It was only the colonel himself whom I barred.\n“We had a bit of barney right away, and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. I was shown straight into his study, and there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling gray beard, seated behind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture's beak, and two fierce gray eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father.\n“‘Well, sir,’ said he in a rasping voice, ‘I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit.’\n“I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife.\n“‘Yes, yes, you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa. We have, of course, only your word for that.’\n“‘I have his letters to me in my pocket.’\n“‘Kindly let me see them.’\n“He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back.\n“‘Well, what then?’ he asked.\n“‘I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir. Many ties and memories united us. Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?’\n“‘I have some recollections, sir, that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. He has gone upon a voyage round the world. His health was in a poor way after his African experiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter.’\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered. ‘But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him.’\n“My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. His great eyebrows came down over his eyes, and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it.\n“‘Many people, Mr. Dodd,’ said he, ‘would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence.’\n“‘You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.’\n“‘Exactly. I have already made every allowance upon that score. I must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however well-intentioned. My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone. Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position.’\n“So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There was no getting past it. I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend's fate had been cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about one's quarters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals.\n“‘I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold.’\n“He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face.\n“‘Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner. You know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so I may say I am his foster-father. It's natural we should take an interest. And you say he carried himself well, sir?’\n“‘There was no braver man in the regiment. He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here.’\n“The old butler rubbed his skinny hands.\n“‘Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over. He was always courageous. There's not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. Nothing would stop him. He was a fine boy—and oh, sir, he was a fine man.’\n“I sprang to my feet.\n“‘Look here!’ I cried. ‘You say he was. You speak as if he were dead. What is all this mystery? What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?’\n“I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away.\n“‘I don't know what you mean, sir. Ask the master about Master Godfrey. He knows. It is not for me to interfere.’\n“He was leaving the room, but I held his arm.\n“‘Listen,’ I said. ‘You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night. Is Godfrey dead?’\n“He could not face my eyes. He was like a man hypnotized. The answer was dragged from his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one.\n“‘I wish to God he was!’ he cried, and, tearing himself free, he dashed from the room.\n“You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. The old man's words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or, at the least, disreputable transaction which touched the family honour. That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light. Godfrey was a reckless fellow. He was easily influenced by those around him. No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me.”\nMy client had paused as one in deep emotion.\n“Pray continue,” I said. “Your problem presents some very unusual features.”\n“He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. I have told you that I looked out at the night. When I did so I left the curtains partly open. His figure was framed in this gap. The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. He was deadly pale—never have I seen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness.\n“There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes. It wasn't merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. It was more subtle than that—something slinking, something furtive, something guilty— something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known. It left a feeling of horror in my mind.\n“But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window. There was an awkward catch, and I was some little time before I could throw it up. Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken.\n“It was a long path and the light was not very good, but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. I ran on and called his name, but it was no use. When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away from me, and he had shut a door behind him. Of that I was certain.\n“There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. Next day I found the colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved.\n“The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. If the secret lay there it was difficult for me to penetrate it. But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house. I must explore the garden and see what I could find. There was no difficulty in the way, for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices.\n“There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size—large enough for a gardener's or a gamekeeper's residence. Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? I approached it in a careless fashion as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat—not at all the gardener type—came out of the door. To my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face.\n“‘Are you a visitor here?’ he asked.\n“I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey’s.\n“‘What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me,’ I continued.\n“‘Quite so. Exactly,’ said he with a rather guilty air. ‘No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time.’ He passed on, but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden.\n“I had a good look at the little house as I passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. I might spoil my own game and even be ordered off the premises if I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched. Therefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry. When all was dark and quiet I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge.\n“I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well. Some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this. I was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter, so that I could see the inside of the room. It was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning. He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper.”\n“What paper?” I asked.\nMy client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative.\n“Can it matter?” he asked.\n“It is most essential.”\n“I really took no notice.”\n“Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies.”\n“Now that you mention it, it was not large. It might have been the Spectator. However, I had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey. I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the fire. I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me.\n“‘This way, sir!’ said he in a low voice. He walked in silence to the house, and I followed him into my own bedroom. He had picked up a time-table in the hall.\n“‘There is a train to London at 8.30,’ said he. ‘The trap will be at the door at eight.’\n“He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend.\n“‘The matter will not bear discussion,’ said he abruptly. ‘You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. You were here as a guest and you have become a spy. I have nothing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.’\n“At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth.\n“‘I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do.’\n“The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to attack me. I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. For my part, I took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written.”\nSuch was the problem which my visitor laid before me. It presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions.\n“The servants,” I asked; “how many were in the house?”\n“To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the simplest fashion.”\n“There was no servant, then, in the detached house?”\n“None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. He seemed, however, to be quite a superior person.”\n“That seems very suggestive. Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other?”\n“Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment.”\n“Did you make any local inquiries?”\n“Yes, I did. I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, Godfrey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. He had come home and then had almost at once started off again. The story was evidently universally accepted.”\n“You said nothing of your suspicions?”\n“Nothing.”\n“That was very wise. The matter should certainly be inquired into. I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park.”\n“To-day?”\nIt happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-gray aspect, with whom I had made the necessary arrangements.\n“This is an old friend,” said I to Dodd. “It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter.”\nThe narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said, and the three of us continued our journey together. In the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear.\n“You say that you saw your friend's face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity?”\n“I have no doubt about it whatever. His nose was pressed against the glass. The lamplight shone full upon him.”\n“It could not have been someone resembling him?”\n“No, no, it was he.”\n“But you say he was changed?”\n“Only in colour. His face was—how shall I describe it?—it was of a fish-belly whiteness. It was bleached.”\n“Was it equally pale all over?”\n“I think not. It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window.”\n“Did you call to him?”\n“I was too startled and horrified for the moment. Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but without result.”\nMy case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. When, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. It seemed to centre on the hall-table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. I passed on into the study with my case complete. Alas, that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story! It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales.\nColonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph's message. We heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen. He held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments.\n“Have I not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off the premises? Never dare to show your damned face here again. If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence. I'll shoot you, sir! By God, I will! As to you, sir,” turning upon me, “I extend the same warning to you. I am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. There is no opening for them here.”\n“I cannot leave here,” said my client firmly, “until I hear from Godfrey's own lips that he is under no restraint.”\nOur involuntary host rang the bell.\n“Ralph,” he said, “telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. Tell him there are burglars in the house.”\n“One moment,” said I. “You must be aware, Mr. Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. On the other hand, he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. I venture to hope that if I were allowed to have five minutes’ conversation with Colonel Emsworth I could certainly alter his view of the matter.”\n“I am not so easily altered,” said the old soldier. “Ralph, do what I have told you. What the devil are you waiting for? Ring up the police!”\n“Nothing of the sort,” I said, putting my back to the door. “Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread.” I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. “That,” said I as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, “is what has brought us here.”\nHe stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished.\n“How do you know?” he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair.\n“It is my business to know things. That is my trade.”\nHe sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. Then he made a gesture of resignation.\n“Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall. It is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that in five minutes we shall be with them.”\nAt the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face.\n“This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,” said he. “This will disarrange all our plans.”\n“I can't help it, Mr. Kent. Our hands have been forced. Can Mr. Godfrey see us?”\n“Yes, he is waiting inside.” He turned and led us into a large, plainly furnished front room. A man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand.\n“Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine!”\nBut the other waved him back.\n“Don't touch me, Jimmie. Keep your distance. Yes, you may well stare! I don't quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do I?”\nHis appearance was certainly extraordinary. One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an African sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin.\n“That's why I don't court visitors,” said he. “I don't mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done without your friend. I suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.”\n“I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey. I saw you that night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up.”\n“Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn't help taking a peep at you. I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up.”\n“But what in heaven's name is the matter?”\n",
      "prompt": "Summarize the following document for Detective story 'The Blanched Soldier' by Unknown. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\nThe ideas of my friend Watson, though limited, are exceedingly pertinacious. For a long time he has worried me to write an experience of my own. Perhaps I have rather invited this persecution, since I have often had occasion to point out to him how superficial are his own accounts and to accuse him of pandering to popular taste instead of confining himself rigidly to facts and figures. “Try it yourself, Holmes!” he has retorted, and I am compelled to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader. The following case can hardly fail to do so, as it is among the strangest happenings in my collection, though it chanced that Watson had no note of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend and biographer, I would take this opportunity to remark that if I burden myself with a companion in my various little inquiries it is not done out of sentiment or caprice, but it is that Watson has some remarkable characteristics of his own to which in his modesty he has given small attention amid his exaggerated estimates of my own performances. A confederate who foresees your conclusions and course of action is always dangerous, but one to whom each development comes as a perpetual surprise, and to whom the future is always a closed book, is indeed an ideal helpmate.\nI find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the conclusion of the Boer War, that I had my visit from Mr. James M. Dodd, a big, fresh, sunburned, upstanding Briton. The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I can recall in our association. I was alone.\nIt is my habit to sit with my back to the window and to place my visitors in the opposite chair, where the light falls full upon them. Mr. James M. Dodd seemed somewhat at a loss how to begin the interview. I did not attempt to help him, for his silence gave me more time for observation. I have found it wise to impress clients with a sense of power, and so I gave him some of my conclusions.\n“From South Africa, sir, I perceive.”\n“Yes, sir,” he answered, with some surprise.\n“Imperial Yeomanry, I fancy.”\n“Exactly.”\n“Middlesex Corps, no doubt.”\n“That is so. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard.”\nI smiled at his bewildered expression.\n“When a gentleman of virile appearance enters my room with such tan upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his handkerchief in his sleeve instead of in his pocket, it is not difficult to place him. You wear a short beard, which shows that you were not a regular. You have the cut of a riding-man. As to Middlesex, your card has already shown me that you are a stockbroker from Throgmorton Street. What other regiment would you join?”\n“You see everything.”\n“I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I see. However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of observation that you called upon me this morning. What has been happening at Tuxbury Old Park?”\n“Mr. Holmes—!”\n“My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter came with that heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it was clear that something sudden and important had occurred.”\n“Yes, indeed. But the letter was written in the afternoon, and a good deal has happened since then. If Colonel Emsworth had not kicked me out—”\n“Kicked you out!”\n“Well, that was what it amounted to. He is a hard nail, is Colonel Emsworth. The greatest martinet in the Army in his day, and it was a day of rough language, too. I couldn't have stuck the colonel if it had not been for Godfrey's sake.”\nI lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair.\n“Perhaps you will explain what you are talking about.”\nMy client grinned mischievously.\n“I had got into the way of supposing that you knew everything without being told,” said he. “But I will give you the facts, and I hope to God that you will be able to tell me what they mean. I've been awake all night puzzling my brain, and the more I think the more incredible does it become.\n“When I joined up in January, 1901—just two years ago—young Godfrey Emsworth had joined the same squadron. He was Colonel Emsworth's only son—Emsworth, the Crimean V. C.—and he had the fighting blood in him, so it is no wonder he volunteered. There was not a finer lad in the regiment. We formed a friendship—the sort of friendship which can only be made when one lives the same life and shares the same joys and sorrows. He was my mate—and that means a good deal in the Army. We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard fighting. Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the action near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. I got one letter from the hospital at Cape Town and one from Southampton. Since then not a word—not one word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my closest pal.\n“Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he would be back for a year. That was all.\n“I wasn't satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole thing seemed to me so damned unnatural. He was a good lad, and he would not drop a pal like that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to know that he was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not always hit it off too well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No, I wasn't satisfied, and I determined that I would get to the root of the matter. It happened, however, that my own affairs needed a lot of straightening out, after two years' absence, and so it is only this week that I have been able to take up Godfrey's case again. But since I have taken it up I mean to drop everything in order to see it through.”\nMr. James M. Dodd appeared to be the sort of person whom it would be better to have as a friend than as an enemy. His blue eyes were stern and his square jaw had set hard as he spoke.\n“Well, what have you done?” I asked.\n“My first move was to get down to his home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford, and to see for myself how the ground lay. I wrote to the mother, therefore—I had had quite enough of the curmudgeon of a father—and I made a clean frontal attack: Godfrey was my chum, I had a great deal of interest which I might tell her of our common experiences, I should be in the neighbourhood, would there be any objection, et cetera? In reply I had quite an amiable answer from her and an offer to put me up for the night. That was what took me down on Monday.\n“Tuxbury Old Hall is inaccessible—five miles from anywhere. There was no trap at the station, so I had to walk, carrying my suitcase, and it was nearly dark before I arrived. It is a great wandering house, standing in a considerable park. I should judge it was of all sorts of ages and styles, starting on a half-timbered Elizabethan foundation and ending in a Victorian portico. Inside it was all panelling and tapestry and half-effaced old pictures, a house of shadows and mystery. There was a butler, old Ralph, who seemed about the same age as the house, and there was his wife, who might have been older. She had been Godfrey's nurse, and I had heard him speak of her as second only to his mother in his affections, so I was drawn to her in spite of her queer appearance. The mother I liked also—a gentle little white mouse of a woman. It was only the colonel himself whom I barred.\n“We had a bit of barney right away, and I should have walked back to the station if I had not felt that it might be playing his game for me to do so. I was shown straight into his study, and there I found him, a huge, bow-backed man with a smoky skin and a straggling gray beard, seated behind his littered desk. A red-veined nose jutted out like a vulture's beak, and two fierce gray eyes glared at me from under tufted brows. I could understand now why Godfrey seldom spoke of his father.\n“‘Well, sir,’ said he in a rasping voice, ‘I should be interested to know the real reasons for this visit.’\n“I answered that I had explained them in my letter to his wife.\n“‘Yes, yes, you said that you had known Godfrey in Africa. We have, of course, only your word for that.’\n“‘I have his letters to me in my pocket.’\n“‘Kindly let me see them.’\n“He glanced at the two which I handed him, and then he tossed them back.\n“‘Well, what then?’ he asked.\n“‘I was fond of your son Godfrey, sir. Many ties and memories united us. Is it not natural that I should wonder at his sudden silence and should wish to know what has become of him?’\n“‘I have some recollections, sir, that I had already corresponded with you and had told you what had become of him. He has gone upon a voyage round the world. His health was in a poor way after his African experiences, and both his mother and I were of opinion that complete rest and change were needed. Kindly pass that explanation on to any other friends who may be interested in the matter.’\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered. ‘But perhaps you would have the goodness to let me have the name of the steamer and of the line by which he sailed, together with the date. I have no doubt that I should be able to get a letter through to him.’\n“My request seemed both to puzzle and to irritate my host. His great eyebrows came down over his eyes, and he tapped his fingers impatiently on the table. He looked up at last with the expression of one who has seen his adversary make a dangerous move at chess, and has decided how to meet it.\n“‘Many people, Mr. Dodd,’ said he, ‘would take offence at your infernal pertinacity and would think that this insistence had reached the point of damned impertinence.’\n“‘You must put it down, sir, to my real love for your son.’\n“‘Exactly. I have already made every allowance upon that score. I must ask you, however, to drop these inquiries. Every family has its own inner knowledge and its own motives, which cannot always be made clear to outsiders, however well-intentioned. My wife is anxious to hear something of Godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone. Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a delicate and difficult position.’\n“So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There was no getting past it. I could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow inwardly that I would never rest until my friend's fate had been cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined quietly, the three of us, in a gloomy, faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently could and retired to my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of sleeping upon the veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about one's quarters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden, remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. Then I sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I was interrupted, however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of coals.\n“‘I thought you might run short in the night-time, sir. It is bitter weather and these rooms are cold.’\n“He hesitated before leaving the room, and when I looked round he was standing facing me with a wistful look upon his wrinkled face.\n“‘Beg your pardon, sir, but I could not help hearing what you said of young Master Godfrey at dinner. You know, sir, that my wife nursed him, and so I may say I am his foster-father. It's natural we should take an interest. And you say he carried himself well, sir?’\n“‘There was no braver man in the regiment. He pulled me out once from under the rifles of the Boers, or maybe I should not be here.’\n“The old butler rubbed his skinny hands.\n“‘Yes, sir, yes, that is Master Godfrey all over. He was always courageous. There's not a tree in the park, sir, that he has not climbed. Nothing would stop him. He was a fine boy—and oh, sir, he was a fine man.’\n“I sprang to my feet.\n“‘Look here!’ I cried. ‘You say he was. You speak as if he were dead. What is all this mystery? What has become of Godfrey Emsworth?’\n“I gripped the old man by the shoulder, but he shrank away.\n“‘I don't know what you mean, sir. Ask the master about Master Godfrey. He knows. It is not for me to interfere.’\n“He was leaving the room, but I held his arm.\n“‘Listen,’ I said. ‘You are going to answer one question before you leave if I have to hold you all night. Is Godfrey dead?’\n“He could not face my eyes. He was like a man hypnotized. The answer was dragged from his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one.\n“‘I wish to God he was!’ he cried, and, tearing himself free, he dashed from the room.\n“You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very happy state of mind. The old man's words seemed to me to bear only one interpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become involved in some criminal or, at the least, disreputable transaction which touched the family honour. That stern old man had sent his son away and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light. Godfrey was a reckless fellow. He was easily influenced by those around him. No doubt he had fallen into bad hands and been misled to his ruin. It was a piteous business, if it was indeed so, but even now it was my duty to hunt him out and see if I could aid him. I was anxiously pondering the matter when I looked up, and there was Godfrey Emsworth standing before me.”\nMy client had paused as one in deep emotion.\n“Pray continue,” I said. “Your problem presents some very unusual features.”\n“He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against the glass. I have told you that I looked out at the night. When I did so I left the curtains partly open. His figure was framed in this gap. The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. He was deadly pale—never have I seen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man. He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished into the darkness.\n“There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes. It wasn't merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the darkness. It was more subtle than that—something slinking, something furtive, something guilty— something very unlike the frank, manly lad that I had known. It left a feeling of horror in my mind.\n“But when a man has been soldiering for a year or two with brother Boer as a playmate, he keeps his nerve and acts quickly. Godfrey had hardly vanished before I was at the window. There was an awkward catch, and I was some little time before I could throw it up. Then I nipped through and ran down the garden path in the direction that I thought he might have taken.\n“It was a long path and the light was not very good, but it seemed to me something was moving ahead of me. I ran on and called his name, but it was no use. When I got to the end of the path there were several others branching in different directions to various outhouses. I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the sound of a closing door. It was not behind me in the house, but ahead of me, somewhere in the darkness. That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away from me, and he had shut a door behind him. Of that I was certain.\n“There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory which would cover the facts. Next day I found the colonel rather more conciliatory, and as his wife remarked that there were some places of interest in the neighbourhood, it gave me an opening to ask whether my presence for one more night would incommode them. A somewhat grudging acquiescence from the old man gave me a clear day in which to make my observations. I was already perfectly convinced that Godfrey was in hiding somewhere near, but where and why remained to be solved.\n“The house was so large and so rambling that a regiment might be hid away in it and no one the wiser. If the secret lay there it was difficult for me to penetrate it. But the door which I had heard close was certainly not in the house. I must explore the garden and see what I could find. There was no difficulty in the way, for the old people were busy in their own fashion and left me to my own devices.\n“There were several small outhouses, but at the end of the garden there was a detached building of some size—large enough for a gardener's or a gamekeeper's residence. Could this be the place whence the sound of that shutting door had come? I approached it in a careless fashion as though I were strolling aimlessly round the grounds. As I did so, a small, brisk, bearded man in a black coat and bowler hat—not at all the gardener type—came out of the door. To my surprise, he locked it after him and put the key in his pocket. Then he looked at me with some surprise on his face.\n“‘Are you a visitor here?’ he asked.\n“I explained that I was and that I was a friend of Godfrey’s.\n“‘What a pity that he should be away on his travels, for he would have so liked to see me,’ I continued.\n“‘Quite so. Exactly,’ said he with a rather guilty air. ‘No doubt you will renew your visit at some more propitious time.’ He passed on, but when I turned I observed that he was standing watching me, half-concealed by the laurels at the far end of the garden.\n“I had a good look at the little house as I passed it, but the windows were heavily curtained, and, so far as one could see, it was empty. I might spoil my own game and even be ordered off the premises if I were too audacious, for I was still conscious that I was being watched. Therefore, I strolled back to the house and waited for night before I went on with my inquiry. When all was dark and quiet I slipped out of my window and made my way as silently as possible to the mysterious lodge.\n“I have said that it was heavily curtained, but now I found that the windows were shuttered as well. Some light, however, was breaking through one of them, so I concentrated my attention upon this. I was in luck, for the curtain had not been quite closed, and there was a crack in the shutter, so that I could see the inside of the room. It was a cheery place enough, a bright lamp and a blazing fire. Opposite to me was seated the little man whom I had seen in the morning. He was smoking a pipe and reading a paper.”\n“What paper?” I asked.\nMy client seemed annoyed at the interruption of his narrative.\n“Can it matter?” he asked.\n“It is most essential.”\n“I really took no notice.”\n“Possibly you observed whether it was a broad-leafed paper or of that smaller type which one associates with weeklies.”\n“Now that you mention it, it was not large. It might have been the Spectator. However, I had little thought to spare upon such details, for a second man was seated with his back to the window, and I could swear that this second man was Godfrey. I could not see his face, but I knew the familiar slope of his shoulders. He was leaning upon his elbow in an attitude of great melancholy, his body turned towards the fire. I was hesitating as to what I should do when there was a sharp tap on my shoulder, and there was Colonel Emsworth beside me.\n“‘This way, sir!’ said he in a low voice. He walked in silence to the house, and I followed him into my own bedroom. He had picked up a time-table in the hall.\n“‘There is a train to London at 8.30,’ said he. ‘The trap will be at the door at eight.’\n“He was white with rage, and, indeed, I felt myself in so difficult a position that I could only stammer out a few incoherent apologies in which I tried to excuse myself by urging my anxiety for my friend.\n“‘The matter will not bear discussion,’ said he abruptly. ‘You have made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. You were here as a guest and you have become a spy. I have nothing more to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.’\n“At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth.\n“‘I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of your own you are concealing him from the world. I have no idea what your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure that he is no longer a free agent. I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that until I am assured as to the safety and well-being of my friend I shall never desist in my efforts to get to the bottom of the mystery, and I shall certainly not allow myself to be intimidated by anything which you may say or do.’\n“The old fellow looked diabolical, and I really thought he was about to attack me. I have said that he was a gaunt, fierce old giant, and though I am no weakling I might have been hard put to it to hold my own against him. However, after a long glare of rage he turned upon his heel and walked out of the room. For my part, I took the appointed train in the morning, with the full intention of coming straight to you and asking for your advice and assistance at the appointment for which I had already written.”\nSuch was the problem which my visitor laid before me. It presented, as the astute reader will have already perceived, few difficulties in its solution, for a very limited choice of alternatives must get to the root of the matter. Still, elementary as it was, there were points of interest and novelty about it which may excuse my placing it upon record. I now proceeded, using my familiar method of logical analysis, to narrow down the possible solutions.\n“The servants,” I asked; “how many were in the house?”\n“To the best of my belief there were only the old butler and his wife. They seemed to live in the simplest fashion.”\n“There was no servant, then, in the detached house?”\n“None, unless the little man with the beard acted as such. He seemed, however, to be quite a superior person.”\n“That seems very suggestive. Had you any indication that food was conveyed from the one house to the other?”\n“Now that you mention it, I did see old Ralph carrying a basket down the garden walk and going in the direction of this house. The idea of food did not occur to me at the moment.”\n“Did you make any local inquiries?”\n“Yes, I did. I spoke to the station-master and also to the innkeeper in the village. I simply asked if they knew anything of my old comrade, Godfrey Emsworth. Both of them assured me that he had gone for a voyage round the world. He had come home and then had almost at once started off again. The story was evidently universally accepted.”\n“You said nothing of your suspicions?”\n“Nothing.”\n“That was very wise. The matter should certainly be inquired into. I will go back with you to Tuxbury Old Park.”\n“To-day?”\nIt happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I had also a commission from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week, as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to Bedfordshire in company with Mr. James M. Dodd. As we drove to Euston we picked up a grave and taciturn gentleman of iron-gray aspect, with whom I had made the necessary arrangements.\n“This is an old friend,” said I to Dodd. “It is possible that his presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further into the matter.”\nThe narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case is actually under consideration. Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing more was said, and the three of us continued our journey together. In the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion to hear.\n“You say that you saw your friend's face quite clearly at the window, so clearly that you are sure of his identity?”\n“I have no doubt about it whatever. His nose was pressed against the glass. The lamplight shone full upon him.”\n“It could not have been someone resembling him?”\n“No, no, it was he.”\n“But you say he was changed?”\n“Only in colour. His face was—how shall I describe it?—it was of a fish-belly whiteness. It was bleached.”\n“Was it equally pale all over?”\n“I think not. It was his brow which I saw so clearly as it was pressed against the window.”\n“Did you call to him?”\n“I was too startled and horrified for the moment. Then I pursued him, as I have told you, but without result.”\nMy case was practically complete, and there was only one small incident needed to round it off. When, after a considerable drive, we arrived at the strange old rambling house which my client had described, it was Ralph, the elderly butler, who opened the door. I had requisitioned the carriage for the day and had asked my elderly friend to remain within it unless we should summon him. Ralph, a little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. I have, as my friend Watson may have remarked, an abnormally acute set of senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. It seemed to centre on the hall-table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a foot of the gloves. Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the curious tarry odour was oozing. I passed on into the study with my case complete. Alas, that I should have to show my hand so when I tell my own story! It was by concealing such links in the chain that Watson was enabled to produce his meretricious finales.\nColonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on receipt of Ralph's message. We heard his quick, heavy step in the passage. The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have seen. He held our cards in his hand, and he tore them up and stamped on the fragments.\n“Have I not told you, you infernal busybody, that you are warned off the premises? Never dare to show your damned face here again. If you enter again without my leave I shall be within my rights if I use violence. I'll shoot you, sir! By God, I will! As to you, sir,” turning upon me, “I extend the same warning to you. I am familiar with your ignoble profession, but you must take your reputed talents to some other field. There is no opening for them here.”\n“I cannot leave here,” said my client firmly, “until I hear from Godfrey's own lips that he is under no restraint.”\nOur involuntary host rang the bell.\n“Ralph,” he said, “telephone down to the county police and ask the inspector to send up two constables. Tell him there are burglars in the house.”\n“One moment,” said I. “You must be aware, Mr. Dodd, that Colonel Emsworth is within his rights and that we have no legal status within his house. On the other hand, he should recognize that your action is prompted entirely by solicitude for his son. I venture to hope that if I were allowed to have five minutes’ conversation with Colonel Emsworth I could certainly alter his view of the matter.”\n“I am not so easily altered,” said the old soldier. “Ralph, do what I have told you. What the devil are you waiting for? Ring up the police!”\n“Nothing of the sort,” I said, putting my back to the door. “Any police interference would bring about the very catastrophe which you dread.” I took out my notebook and scribbled one word upon a loose sheet. “That,” said I as I handed it to Colonel Emsworth, “is what has brought us here.”\nHe stared at the writing with a face from which every expression save amazement had vanished.\n“How do you know?” he gasped, sitting down heavily in his chair.\n“It is my business to know things. That is my trade.”\nHe sat in deep thought, his gaunt hand tugging at his straggling beard. Then he made a gesture of resignation.\n“Well, if you wish to see Godfrey, you shall. It is no doing of mine, but you have forced my hand. Ralph, tell Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Kent that in five minutes we shall be with them.”\nAt the end of that time we passed down the garden path and found ourselves in front of the mystery house at the end. A small bearded man stood at the door with a look of considerable astonishment upon his face.\n“This is very sudden, Colonel Emsworth,” said he. “This will disarrange all our plans.”\n“I can't help it, Mr. Kent. Our hands have been forced. Can Mr. Godfrey see us?”\n“Yes, he is waiting inside.” He turned and led us into a large, plainly furnished front room. A man was standing with his back to the fire, and at the sight of him my client sprang forward with outstretched hand.\n“Why, Godfrey, old man, this is fine!”\nBut the other waved him back.\n“Don't touch me, Jimmie. Keep your distance. Yes, you may well stare! I don't quite look the smart Lance-Corporal Emsworth, of B Squadron, do I?”\nHis appearance was certainly extraordinary. One could see that he had indeed been a handsome man with clear-cut features sunburned by an African sun, but mottled in patches over this darker surface were curious whitish patches which had bleached his skin.\n“That's why I don't court visitors,” said he. “I don't mind you, Jimmie, but I could have done without your friend. I suppose there is some good reason for it, but you have me at a disadvantage.”\n“I wanted to be sure that all was well with you, Godfrey. I saw you that night when you looked into my window, and I could not let the matter rest till I had cleared things up.”\n“Old Ralph told me you were there, and I couldn't help taking a peep at you. I hoped you would not have seen me, and I had to run to my burrow when I heard the window go up.”\n“But what in heaven's name is the matter?”\n\n\nProvide a comprehensive summary (between 600 and 900 words long) of the key events, information, and important details from this document."

    "final_summary": "“The Blanched Soldier” recounts a curious and unsettling case presented to Sherlock Holmes by Mr. James M. Dodd, a robust and earnest stockbroker and former Imperial Yeomanry soldier who had recently returned from the Boer War. The narrative is told by Holmes himself, who remarks early on that his friend Dr. Watson’s accounts tend toward the sensational rather than the strictly factual—a fact that motivated Holmes to tell this particular story from his own perspective.\n\nThe case begins in January 1903, shortly after the Boer War had concluded. Holmes was alone at his lodgings, as Watson had recently married and was temporarily absent. Dodd arrived, sunburned from his service in South Africa, with an urgent and perplexing problem concerning his close friend and fellow soldier, Godfrey Emsworth. James M. Dodd explains that Godfrey was the son of Colonel Emsworth, a harsh, intimidating man known for his military discipline and formidable personality.\n\nGodfrey and Dodd had forged a close friendship during their service in the war, sharing hardships and camaraderie for over a year. However, Godfrey had been seriously wounded near Pretoria by an elephant gun, after which communication from him abruptly ceased for more than six months. When the war ended and they returned to England, Dodd sought to contact Godfrey but received a curt reply from Colonel Emsworth. The Colonel claimed that Godfrey had embarked on a year-long world voyage for health reasons and advised against further inquiries. This vague explanation seemed suspicious to Dodd, especially given the known tension between father and son and Godfrey’s spirited nature.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Dodd wrote to Godfrey’s mother, who responded warmly and invited him to visit their family estate, Tuxbury Old Park near Bedford. On arrival, Dodd found the old manor to be a sprawling, ancient, and gloomy dwelling with an air of mystery. The household staff consisted chiefly of the aging butler Ralph and his wife, who had served as Godfrey’s nurse during his youth and was kindly disposed toward him.\n\nDodd quickly learned that Colonel Emsworth was a difficult and stern man. His initial meeting with the Colonel was fraught with tension. The Colonel dismissed Dodd’s story of their friendship, doubted its authenticity despite being shown letters from Godfrey to Dodd, and reiterated that Godfrey was traveling abroad for health reasons. When Dodd pressed for details of the voyage, refusing to relent, the Colonel brusquely warned him to cease making inquiries into their family affairs, emphasizing that the past was a closed matter. Despite this, Dodd resolved to persist.\n\nThat evening, Dodd was approached by the old butler Ralph, who revealed a shocking emotional response when questioned about Godfrey’s fate. Ralph described Godfrey as courageous and beloved but implied something was terribly wrong—his words carried an undertone of despair and hinted at a secret. When Dodd confronted Ralph directly about whether Godfrey was dead, the butler’s anguished reply, “I wish to God he was,” deepened the mystery and filled Dodd with dread.\n\nLater that night, as Dodd sat by the fire in his bedroom, he suddenly saw a ghostly figure—Godfrey himself—pressing a pale, ghastly face against the glass of the garden window. Godfrey’s skin was bleached to a sickly “fish-belly” whiteness, far different from the man Dodd had known. The spectacle was so startling that Godfrey fled into the darkness upon being seen, leaving Dodd to pursue him only to hear the sound of a door shutting somewhere outside the house. Though Dodd searched, he could not find his friend and returned troubled and perplexed.\n\nThe next day, Dodd attempted to snoop around the estate grounds and was drawn to a detached outbuilding that did not seem a typical gardener’s lodge. From there emerged a sharply dressed, brisk little man named Mr. Kent, who appeared surprised by Dodd’s presence and locked the doors behind him suspiciously. Dodd observed that the windows were curtained and shuttered, but noticed signs of life inside, including a warm fire and a small lamp. That night, he returned covertly and peered inside through a crack to see the little man smoking a pipe and a second man sitting near the fire with his back to the window. Dodd was convinced without seeing the face that this was Godfrey, deeply melancholy and withdrawn.\n\nBefore Dodd could act further, Colonel Emsworth appeared suddenly, furious at Dodd’s intrusion and ordering him to leave immediately, even threatening violence if he returned. Dodd declared his intention not to rest until Godfrey was confirmed safe and free, challenging Emsworth’s secrecy. The Colonel’s rage was volcanic, but Dodd stood firm.\n\nHolmes, upon hearing this convoluted account, recognized the case’s essential facts: Godfrey was hidden at home under some mysterious restraint or condition, his health or status obscured by the father’s authoritarian control. The few household servants, especially the strangely behaved butler Ralph and the enigmatic Mr. Kent, added to the puzzle.\n\nHolmes accompanied Dodd back to Tuxbury Old Park with a discreet ally for assistance. Upon arrival, Holmes immediately noticed a faint but distinctive tarry smell emanating from a pair of brown leather gloves left on the hall table by Ralph, an unusual clue. Their wait was brief before Colonel Emsworth stormed in with violent expletives, warning them again to depart or face deadly force. Holmes revealed to the Colonel a piece of evidence — the word “Phossy Jaw” written in his notebook — which evidently struck a nerve and forced him to relent. The Colonel reluctantly agreed to allow them to see Godfrey, acknowledging that events had forced his hand.\n\nThe party proceeded to the detached lodge where Godfrey awaited them. The son looked older, ill, and physically altered — his robust sun-tanned features marred by irregular patches of blanched, pallid skin, lending him a ghastly, sickly appearance. He rejected physical contact from Dodd and spoke with bitterness and melancholy, acknowledging how his condition had warped his life and existence.\n\nThough the story breaks off at this point, it points toward a tragic condition underlying Godfrey’s concealment — likely a chronic illness or deformity, hinted at by the bleached skin and references to “Phossy Jaw,” a serious workplace-related bone disease caused by phosphorus exposure typically in match factory workers. The father’s rigid and secretive demeanor, the isolation of the son in a secluded lodge, and the protective butler’s despair all coalesce into a narrative of concealed suffering and familial shame.\n\nThe case stands out for its combination of military comradeship, mysterious illness, family conflict, and the haunting image of a once-vigorous soldier reduced to a spectral and isolated figure. Holmes’ involvement promises to bring the hidden truths to light through logic, observation, and persistence, highlighting the limits of appearances and the depths of personal tragedy behind outward facades.\n\nIn summary, “The Blanched Soldier” is a haunting detective story centered on the disappearance and mysterious fate of Godfrey Emsworth, a young soldier returned from the Boer War but shrouded in secrecy and physical decline. The investigation traverses the terrain of loyalty, paternal authority, and the social stigma of illness, with Holmes called upon to unravel a poignant and eerie mystery concealed within an ancient English estate.",
