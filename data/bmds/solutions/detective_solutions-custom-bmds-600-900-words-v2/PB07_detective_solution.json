    "full_text": "“The Poisoner” is a gripping detective story centered around the mysterious and tragic poisoning of Letitia Woodriff, the beloved daughter of John Woodriff. The narrative opens with the somber concluding statement by the Coroner’s jury, which finds that Letitia, affectionately called Letty, was accidentally poisoned by morphia. However, the exact means of how the poison was taken or administered remains unclear, leaving the case unresolved and steeped in sorrow. The jury expresses sympathy to the grieving father, setting a tone of profound loss and unanswered questions.\n\nJohn Woodriff’s heartbreak is portrayed with poignant intimacy. He visits Letty’s room after the inquest, where she lies dead, serene and beautiful in death. His grief is overwhelming—he touches her cold hand, kisses her icy lips, and sobs uncontrollably. Milly, Letty’s twin sister, gently comforts their father, reminding him that letting despair consume him would grieve Letty even in heaven. The siblings’ shared pain and tenderness highlight the emotional core of the story. John then reveals his deep fear that Milly, now his only remaining daughter, may also be in danger, as Letty is not the first to be poisoned in their family.\n\nTo investigate this dire suspicion, John has summoned Paul Beck, an old schoolfriend turned esteemed London detective, known for his keen intellect. Beck arrives after the inquest, and their reunion reveals old camaraderie juxtaposed against the dark present crisis. As they walk along the seaside near the Woodriff estate, John confides his fears and recounts the bizarre, frightening deaths that have befallen his family. Only a year earlier, his eldest daughter Barbara died suddenly at school in Germany under similar circumstances, originally diagnosed as heart disease but now suspected to have been poisoning by morphia, like Letty’s death.\n\nJohn describes the circumstances of Letty’s death in detail: Letty was lively and well the morning she died, had breakfast with Milly and a cousin, Susan Coolin, who is visiting from Liverpool, and remained home while the others went to a party. Letty was awaiting a letter and went into town to meet the postman. Soon after, she was found dead on her bed, having apparently taken a fatal dose of morphia — approximately ten grains, enough to cause death rapidly. No suicide motive was deemed plausible given Letty’s bright and cheerful demeanor, and no servants or family members present were suspected due to their affection for her and absence of motive.\n\nThe possible motive emerges from John’s family history and inheritance complications. The Woodriff family originally comprised five siblings, but two brothers, Dick and Robert, are now deceased. Dick, who died three years ago after a successful but reckless business career, left his sizable fortune to John’s three daughters, on condition they reach adulthood. Otherwise, the inheritance would revert to a cousin, Dr. Coleman Woodriff, Robert’s son and a Liverpool doctor of good reputation but a potentially dubious beneficiary. Although John trusts Coleman and dismisses any foul play on his part, Paul Beck is alert to the inheritance as a strong motive for murder, despite John’s protests.\n\nPaul Beck’s investigatory methodicalness is demonstrated when he examines Letty’s room, finding carefully concealed clues among the ashes of burned papers, dust sweepings, and fragments of items including a melted piece of blue glass, half-burned pasteboard, antique gold ring, notched white ribbon, colorful silk threads, and hairpins. These cryptic findings suggest hidden correspondence or evidence related to the murder, indicating intricate plotting or concealment.\n\nSoon after, Beck returns disguised as Peter Woodriff, the Woodriff brother who resides in Chicago. This bold ruse allows him to observe the household and its inhabitants without raising suspicion. His assumed identity is so convincing that even John Woodriff, despite his usual difficulty with pretense, accepts him as his brother, and the girls grow fond of their “uncle,” especially Susan Coolin, who is shy, innocent, and deeply affected by Letty’s death. Susan confides her dislike for Dr. Coleman Woodriff, a sentiment she struggles to reconcile with his kind actions, which adds complexity to the character dynamics and possible tensions.\n\nAs the days pass, Beck-as-Peter becomes a fixture in the household, participating in daily life and gaining trust. Milly sometimes brightens, though her grief remains palpable, while Susan maintains a steady, gentle presence. The familial relationships and social interactions are portrayed with subtlety, showing Beck’s immersion in the case and environment.\n\nAn evocative episode centers around a particular morning when the postman delivers an unusually large batch of letters and packages, including a wedge-shaped box of wedding cake addressed to “Louisa Thompson.” This cake seems innocent but carries significance, as Beck’s careful observation of its arrival and the ribbon used sparks intrigue. Milly and Susan share the cake by cutting it into two pieces, but Uncle Peter quietly intervenes, switching the pieces between them with a subtle gesture, hinting at his awareness and suspicion about the contents or message embedded in this gift, and underscoring the tension of concealed dangers.\n\nThroughout the story, key themes emerge: grief and familial love, the shadow of inheritance motives, the pervasive fear of an unseen poisoner, and the interplay of trust and suspicion within intimate relationships. The narrative builds a suspenseful atmosphere marked by layers of mystery—each new revelation deepens the enigma of Letty’s death and the potential threat to Milly.\n\nPaul Beck’s calm, analytical presence contrasts with John Woodriff’s wild grief and mounting terror, embodying the rational pursuit of truth amid emotional turmoil. Beck’s strategic decision to infiltrate the household in disguise demonstrates ingenuity and a firm commitment to uncovering the murderer before the tragic pattern claims another victim.\n\nIn conclusion, “The Poisoner” is a richly textured detective story that explores a family haunted by suspicious deaths, where grief, fear, and suspicion intertwine. The unexpected deaths of two daughter figures—Letty and Barbara—both attributed to morphia poisoning, prompt a desperate investigation fueled by inheritance motives and simmering family resentments.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First look for a reason strong enough to make repeated murder in the same family worthwhile.  \n\t•  Uncle Dick Woodriff’s will leaves a very large fortune to John Woodriff’s three girls – Barbara, Letty and Milly – but ONLY if they live to be of age.  \n\t•  If even one of them dies the fortune is divided among the survivors; if all three are dead the money goes to the late Robert Woodriff’s only child, Dr Coleman Woodriff of Liverpool.  \n\t→  No-one in the story has a motive one-tenth as powerful as Dr Coleman: if all the girls die he becomes a rich man at one stroke.\n\n2. Could Coleman reach the girls?  \n\t•  He is a medical man – obtaining morphia is easy.  \n\t•  He lives in Liverpool, far away; but Letty was poisoned while alone in her own room, so the poison had to reach her in or by post.  \n\t•  A Liverpool visitor – Susan Coolin, Cole­man’s cousin and near neighbour – happens to be staying in the house at the critical time.  She is the obvious intermediary.\n\n3. Clues found in Letty’s grate:  \n\t•  Melted blue glass, pasteboard, silk, ribbon, pins, a little ring – exactly the rubbish that is left when the tiny bride-and-bridegroom ornament that tops a slice of *wedding cake* is burnt.  \n\t•  Therefore Letty received a parcel of wedding cake and destroyed the trimmings after eating the slice.  The morphia must have been hidden in, or smeared upon, the almond icing of that cake.\n\n4. The second slice of wedding cake:  \n\t•  A few days later the postman again brings a *wedge-shaped box of cake*, addressed this time to the fictitious “Louisa Thompson”.  \n\t•  Susan and Milly open it and cut the cake in two.  Susan unobtrusively pushes *one* half towards Milly and keeps the other for herself.  \n\t•  Beck, watching as “Uncle Peter”, quietly changes the two pieces.  This only has a point if he believes ONE half – the one Susan tried to give Milly – is poisoned and the other is safe.  \n\t→  The incident proves Susan knows which piece contains the drug.  She can know that only if she and the sender planned the dose between them.\n\n5. Opportunity & alibi:  \n\t•  On the morning Letty died, only Susan was in the house with her.  She had time to hand Letty the fatal slice and afterwards burn the box and ornaments in the bedroom grate before leaving for the party with Milly.  \n\t•  No servant had occasion to meddle with morphia; John, Milly and the maids are all without motive and are away or watched at the material times.\n\n6. Logical chain  \n\tmotive – Coleman.  \n\tdrug supply – Coleman (doctor).  \n\taccess to victim – Susan (resident in house).  \n\tevidence – wedding-cake ornaments; attempted second poisoning; Beck’s switch.  \n\t→  Two-person conspiracy: mastermind Dr Coleman Woodriff, agent and accomplice Susan Coolin.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDr Coleman Woodriff, Susan Coolin, Milly Woodriff, John Woodriff, the servants\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nDr Coleman Woodriff\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nSusan Coolin\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Uncle Dick’s will promises his large fortune to the three Woodriff girls if they live to twenty-one; otherwise the money passes to their cousin, Dr Coleman Woodriff.  \n•  Greedy for the fortune, Coleman plans to remove the girls.  Because he cannot be constantly near them he enlists the help of his younger cousin and neighbour in Liverpool, Susan Coolin, who is secretly in love with him and expects to share the spoil.  He supplies her with morphia tablets and the idea of hiding them in the almond icing of “harmless” gifts of wedding cake posted from Liverpool.  \n•  A year earlier a box of cake reaches Barbara at her German school: she eats, is found dead; the school doctor calls it heart failure.  \n•  In the present story Susan is staying with the family.  On the morning of the fête she gives Letty the latest parcel of cake, watches her eat it and then burns the cardboard box and gay little bride-and-bridegroom ornament in the bedroom fire grate before going out with Milly.  Letty dies a few minutes later.  \n•  Coleman posts a further parcel, again containing wedding cake, addressed to the fictitious “Louisa Thompson”, timing it so it will arrive when Susan can serve it to the last obstacle, Milly.  \n•  Beck, now inside the household as “Uncle Peter”, has already realised from the scorched fragments that cake was the vehicle of the first poison.  He therefore keeps a special watch on the post.  \n•  When the second parcel appears he sees Susan manoeuvre the two slices so that Milly shall get the prepared half.  He quietly changes the plates.  Susan must either eat her own poison or betray herself by refusing.  Her panic, and the chemical proof Beck will afterwards obtain from the slice, complete the case.  \n•  Coleman, confronted by Susan’s confession and Beck’s evidence, is arrested as the man who conceived and supplied the morphia; Susan is arrested as the hand that administered it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Milly Woodriff – Although she stood to share a larger portion of the inheritance after Letty’s death, she gained nothing by Barbara’s earlier death and would lose everything if she herself died; she had no access to morphia in Germany, and Beck’s cake-switch experiment shows she was the intended victim, not the poisoner.  \n•  John Woodriff – A devoted father ruined by grief; murdering his own daughters would rob him, not enrich him.  He was away from the house when the poison was taken.  \n•  Servants – They neither profit by the deaths nor possess the morphia or the opportunity to post parcels; none was near Letty when she swallowed the fatal dose.  \nHence only the Coleman–Susan combination fits *motive, means, opportunity* and is corroborated by the physical clues.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

      "text": "“WE find that Letitia Woodriff was accidentally poisoned by morphia. How taken or administered there is not sufficient evidence before us to show, and we desire to express our profound sympathy with the afflicted father, Mr. Woodriff, in the sad bereavement that has befallen him.”\n* * *\nThe Coroner’s jury could reach no deeper than this in the perplexing mystery. Their verdict given, with grave faces and quiet tread they left the father’s house, where by special favour the inquest had been held.\nThen John Woodriff stole up softly, as though he feared to waken her, to the room where his dead daughter lay, beautiful in death. With a timid gentleness he touched the little hand cold and white on the coverlet. The placid face with the still smile on the pale lips half frightened him. It seemed as if death had lifted his dear little girl—his own familiar pet and plaything—so far above him that even his thoughts could not reach to her now. It was no longer his girl that he had so loved and that so loved him, that lay there so calm and cold. An angel was in the room, pure and placid. His own bright, warm, loving Letty was lost to him for ever.\nWith a spasm of pain that gripped his very heartstrings, he bent over and kissed those poor chill lips passionately. The ice-cold touch stabbed him with a sudden agony of new grief, though his daughter was now two days dead. He pressed his face upon the counterpane, and his deep sobs shook the bed where the placid dead lay.\nThen the door opened softly and a face showed itself at the opening—a young girl’s face, wan and white, with red rims under the eyes.\n“Father,” said a soft voice, replete with tenderness, and Milly Woodriff stole to where her father knelt, shaken by sorrow, and threw her arm round his neck and strove to whisper words of comfort in his ear, though her own heart was breaking.\n“Don’t, father, don’t!” she said; “it would grieve her, even in heaven, to see you thus; she, who was always so gentle, so cheery, and so loving. It’s hard to bear, God knows, it’s hard to bear, but we have each other left to love and live for until we meet our darling again.”\nThe broken-hearted man yielded like a tired child to her caressing touch, and she led him from the room.\n“Thank God, Milly,” he whispered, “you are still left to me,” as they sat together with clasped hands in the big silent sitting-room, where even the sunlight seemed to come sadly now.\nA sudden fear, a pang of sharp remembrance came upon him as he spoke. He caught her hand so tightly that he hurt it. “Oh! my God,” he cried, in a sort of frenzy, “must I lose her too!”\nAfter that he sat for a long time looking at her earnestly, softly stroking the brown silky hair, and all the time a yearning, frightened look in his eyes.\nPresently he seemed to steady himself with an effort, like one who has a purpose in view.\n“Has any one come by the train, Milly?” he asked.\n“The train is hardly in yet, father,” she answered, with a glance at the marble clock on the mantelpiece, “and it’s a good half-hour from town, you know. Do you expect any one?”\n“I wired the day before yesterday to London for a detective—a man named Beck—Paul Beck. We were at school together, and great friends then, though we have not met since. I have heard he is the keenest detective in London. I hoped to have had him down for the inquest. If any man can find out how poor Letty died, he can.”\n“What’s the use, father, of worrying over that now? It will only help to keep the wound open in your heart. It won’t bring our darling back to us.”\n“Milly,” he said, with such earnestness he frightened her, “I would give my right hand this moment to know how death came to poor Letty.”\nThere was silence again. Presently he asked abruptly, “Where is Susan?”\n“In her room, father, utterly broken down. She has hardly eaten or slept since. In some things Susan is like a little child, and she and Letty were such friends!”\n“Go to her, my dear. You will comfort each other. I’m restless and impatient for this man to come. I’ll walk down a bit of the road and meet him.”\nMr. Woodriff’s house was a tall, red-brick building that looked out from the breast of a wooded slope far over the sea. About three miles inland was the large and prosperous town of Deringham, where Mr. Woodriff, as an ironmaster, had acquired the ample fortune which enabled him to purchase the house and grounds of Merview, and live in comfort on the borders of the sea which he had loved from a boy.\nAs he strode steadily down the high-road, half-way between the town and his house, a hansom went past him rapidly. One quick glance showed him seated in it a placid, dull-looking man, whom he at once set down as a commercial traveller. But the hansom pulled up sharply before it had got twenty yards past. The dull-looking man leaped out like a schoolboy and ran back towards him, calling his name.\n“Don’t you know me, Jack?” he cried cordially, with hand outstretched. “I knew you at first sight.”\nMr. Woodriff looked for a moment bewildered; then a light dawned on him. “Surely you cannot be little Paul Beck?” he cried.\n“Little or great, I’m Paul Beck as surely as you are John Woodriff—the very same Paul Beck you saved from many a basting at school when I was a small boy, and you were a big one. I’m heartily sorry, Jack, that our first meeting again should be such a sad one.”\n“You got my wire, then?”\n“And your letter; both the same time. I was out of town when the wire came or I should have been down for the inquest. What was the verdict?”\n“Accidental death.”\nMr. Beck glanced at his face. “And what do you think yourself?”\n“I really don’t know what to think.”\nAgain Mr. Beck looked at him keenly and steadily. “You are horribly cut up, Jack, and all of a shiver. There is something else besides grief troubling you; something frightening you. I’ll send the cab on to the house; we will talk this thing out while we walk. I always feel most alone where there are no walls.”\nThey walked on together for a few moments without a word, till they came to a by-path on the left hand that led straight to the sea. They turned off the higher road, still without speaking. Mr. Woodriff’s face was haggard and perplexed and his eyes on the ground, and Mr. Beck glanced at him now and again as if striving to read his thoughts. The by-road took them out on a broad stretch of smooth strand. Beyond this to the sky-line the sea lay sparkling, and the long, clear ripples split themselves on the sand, foaming softly like champagne. At their back the cliffs rose in a black wall.\n“What is it?” asked Mr. Beck abruptly, as they walked close to the sea’s margin.\n“I’m afraid.”\n“Afraid of what?”\n“I don’t know of what or of whom, but I’m in deadly terror that my daughter Milly—my only daughter now—may be taken from me. Letty is not the first that has been poisoned. I dread she may not be the last.” He was trembling all over.\nMr. Beck took his arm. “Jack,” he said quietly, “if I can help you, I will, for old times’ sake, if for nothing else. Things may seem blacker to you than they really are. Tell me straight out what you know and what you fear.”\n“It’s a long story, Paul.”\nIt was curious how naturally the old schoolfellows dropped into the tone and names of a quarter of a century ago.\n“I’m in no hurry. Tell it your own way, but tell the whole of it.”\n“Only a year ago my eldest daughter Barbara died suddenly at school in the south of Germany. The telegram announcing her death miscarried, and she was buried before I arrived. The doctor said it was heart disease. I didn’t doubt it at the time; I had no reason to doubt it. But now I’m sure she was poisoned with morphia, as poor Letty was poisoned. It happened just the same way. Babs had been quite well all the morning, and breakfasted with the other girls. After breakfast she went to her room to read her letters from home. An hour later they found her lying back, huddled up in an easy-chair. They thought her sleeping, but she was dead.”\n“Your daughter Letty died in the same way?”\n“Precisely. Her twin-sister, Milly, and her cousin, Susan Coolin, who is on a visit with us, were at a young peoples’ party at the other side of the town, and stayed overnight. Letty insisted on remaining at home with me. We breakfasted together, and she was full of life and spirits. She was expecting a letter from an old schoolfellow, and she walked into town to meet the postman. We were together as far as the turn to the sea. I went out for a few hours’ mackerel fishing. She kept the road towards the town. Twenty yards away she turned smilingly to kiss hands to me as I passed the corner. I never saw her alive again.\n“When I returned the house was in an uproar of alarm and grief. The girls had just returned, and found Letty lying half across her bed, as if she had fallen on it, dead. At the inquest morphia poison was proved. She must have taken nearly ten grains of pure morphia the doctor declared—enough to cause death in less than half an hour.”\n“Had your daughters any love affairs?”\n“None that I ever heard of. They are very young—poor Letty wasn’t eighteen; a perfect schoolgirl. Did I tell you that she and Milly were twins? Babs was about the same age when she died—when she was poisoned in Germany.”\n“They were cheery girls, you say?”\n“As gay as larks. You may put suicide out of your head, if that is what you are thinking of.”\n“Suicide and accident dismissed; then we come to murder. Who were in the house when your daughter Letty was poisoned?”\n“Family servants, every man and woman of them. I’d as soon think of suspecting myself. Besides, there was no motive, and they all loved her.”\nSomething in the way the word “motive” was said caught Mr. Beck’s quick ear.\nHe turned round and faced John Woodriff there on the lonely sand, breaking off their walk abruptly.\n“What are you hiding from me, Jack? What motive do you know for this crime?”\n“I know of none.”\n“What do you guess, then? Come, be frank if I am to help you.”\n“The very thought is so preposterous—so horrible—that I don’t like even to put it in words. Besides, it is impossible.”\n“Let me judge of that. By clearing the impossibles out of the way we come to the possibles.”\n“I must go back a bit, then, to explain. You may remember we Woodriffs were five in family; four brothers and a sister. The eldest, Robert, became a doctor and settled down in Liverpool. He put his only son, Coleman Woodriff, to the same profession, and left him his practice—not a very good one, by all accounts—when he died. My second brother, Peter, has been in Chicago for thirty years, a bachelor, doing well and promising every year to pay us a visit. But he has nothing to do with what I have to say to you. The two youngest were myself and Dick. Dick always hated Robert like poison, but he and I were the best of friends till, as ill-luck would have it, we fell in love with the same girl. We fought our battle out fairly, like brothers, for her love, and I won! Poor Alice! No man ever had a better wife, but she died after the twins were born. I loved the little ones the dearer for her sake. Dick never got over his grief. He didn’t quarrel with me—he was too decent a chap for that—but he threw up his business; he was doing well as a stockbroker in Liverpool, and went to Australia, and stayed there till he died about three years ago. He speculated recklessly in land and building lots. But everything turned up trumps for him—crossed in love, you know the proverb—and he made a big pile.\n“He and I were good friends to the very last. He wrote every other post. He was very fond of the girls—for Alice’s sake, I think, as much as mine—constantly sent them handsome presents, and when he died he left them every farthing he had in the world, close on a quarter of a million.”\n“Share and share alike?”\n“Share and share alike, or to the survivors or survivor after they reached the age of eighteen years.”\nMr. Beck whistled under his breath. “If none reached the age of eighteen?” he asked, after a pause.\n“There was no provision in the will for that. I suppose poor Dick never thought of that. But I have consulted a lawyer about it. He tells me that if my three daughters should die under eighteen there is an ‘intestacy,’ and as the property is what he calls ‘real,’ that is houses and lands, it all goes to Dr. Coleman Woodriff, as heir-at-law to the deceased.”\n“Here’s our motive, anyway,” said Mr. Beck, “clear enough and strong enough.”\n“But the thing is preposterous,” protested Mr. Woodriff earnestly, “admitting that the man, my brother’s son, could be such a devil, and I won’t and don’t admit it! Still he could have no hand in this. He was in Liverpool when Babs was poisoned in Germany; he was in Liverpool when Letty was poisoned here.”\n“What kind of a fellow is this Dr. Coleman Woodriff?” persisted Mr. Beck.\n“A very decent fellow, by all accounts, and clever, too; though he has been always pulling the devil by the tail. I haven’t seen much of him, but I liked what I saw. My sister and his aunt, Mrs. Coolin, who is a widow, and lives in Liverpool, knows him well, and likes him greatly. It’s her only daughter, Susan, that I told you is staying with us.”\n“What does Susan think of Dr. Coleman?”\n“Well, she doesn’t like him—that’s a fact. But it’s only a young girl’s whim. She’s a quiet, shy little body, two years older than Milly, but you’d think she was three years younger—she’s like a child in the ways of the world. In spite of her unreasoning dislike of Dr. Coleman, she has nothing but what is good to say of him. Believe me, Paul, if you want to get to the bottom of this thing, you’d best leave him out of your head.”\n“Humph!” was Mr. Beck’s sole comment on this appeal, and there was a long lapse into silence.\n“Did your daughter Letty get the letter she was expecting?” he asked presently.\n“I cannot say. There was a fire in her room, and we found the ashes of some papers in the grate.”\n“No trace of poison found anywhere?”\n“None. The servants swore that she tasted nothing after her return. I have had her room locked since she died, hoping you would come.”\nIt was only by a palpable effort that the man forced himself to answer Mr. Beck’s questions calmly and clearly, keeping down by a strong effort the grief and fear that tortured him. Mr. Beck walked on in silence, with a face as blank as a gravestone, and the other watched him with eyes of helpless, piteous appeal, like a dog’s.\nIn a moment or two John Woodriff’s impatience mastered him.\n“For God’s sake, speak, man!” he broke out.\n“I have nothing to say worth saying,” Mr. Beck answered quietly.\n“You believe there has been foul play. You think Milly is in danger?”\n“I fear so.”\nThe self-restraint of the father snapped suddenly, and his grief and fear broke loose.\n“You will help me to save her, Paul, my poor little girl—my last? God pity me! For the sake of old times, you will help me to save her?”\nA look of deep sympathy came to Mr. Beck’s face, transforming it for a moment. For answer he gripped his old schoolmate’s hand.\n“Steady, Jack!” he said. “You will need all your nerve before this business is through. How old is your daughter Milly?”\n“She wants barely a month of eighteen.”\n“That shortens the job. This elder brother in Chicago—Peter, I think you said—can we have him back at once?”\nJohn Woodriff stared at him as if he had gone suddenly mad.\n“I mean, can I be your eldest brother and live with you for a month or so without arousing suspicion?”\n“Oh, certainly! No one here knows him, and everybody knows that I have been expecting him.”\n“That’s settled then. The day after to-morrow your eldest brother Peter will turn up unexpectedly from Chicago. But, mind, the secret is between us two. Not a word to a single soul.”\n“Not even to Milly or Susan?\n“Most certainly not! I must be Peter Woodriff to every one but you. Now there is one thing more. I want to have a look at the room where your daughter died before I go back to town.”\nBut Mr. Woodriff objected shrewdly. “If you are coming back as Peter, best not show yourself at all now.”\n“Does any one know that Mr. Beck, the detective, was expected?”\n“No one except my daughter Milly.”\n“I think I had best put in an appearance,” said Mr. Beck. “It’s no harm that I should have a look round with two pair of eyes—Mr. Paul Beck’s and Mr. Peter Woodriff’s. I don’t think the young ladies—or any one else for that matter—are likely to recognise me on my next visit. By the way, what is brother Peter like?”\n“Like me they say, only taller.”\nWhen they got to the house they found Milly Woodriff shy and frightened of the London detective. It was meek-eyed Susan Coolin that saw to his comfort, sat with him at lunch, and showed him to the room where her dead cousin still lay.\n“If I can help you in any way, Mr. Beck, please tell me,” she said, looking wistfully in his face with guileless blue eyes. “I was very fond of poor Letty.”\n“I’m sure of that, my poor child,” he said gently. “But I do my work best alone.”\nHe locked the room door on the inside, and began his search at once. Nothing escaped his quick eyes and hands. Finally he swept all the dust into a corner and examined it carefully, and then sifted the ashes in the grate through his fingers. In the ashes he found a blob of blue glass, melted to a long needle at one end, and a fragment, half burned, of a white pasteboard box. In the dust sweepings there was a little twisted gold ring of antique make and small value, a strip of narrow white ribbon notched like the edges of a saw; a tangle of bright-coloured silk threads, and innumerable pins and hairpins.\nHe showed his treasures in the palm of his big hand to John Woodriff just before he started.\n“I have a notion,” he said, “that there are one or two letters of our riddle here, if I can only manage to pick them out of the rubbish.”\n* * *\nTwo days later a tall, loose-limbed man, with unmistakable suggestions of the Yankee in voice, dress, and figure, inquired at Merview for Mr. John Woodriff.\nFor a moment Mr. Woodriff was puzzled. But when the stranger said in a quiet drawl, slightly flavoured with a nasal twang: “Reckon, John, you don’t know your own brother Peter who has come away round the big ball for a squint at you,” Mr. Woodriff grasped his hand heartily, and welcomed Mr. Beck with unaffected cordiality.\nIt was a marvellous make-up. Peter Woodriff, of Chicago, was a very tall man—nearly three inches taller than Mr. Beck, whom he in no way resembled. About the lines of eyes and mouth there was a strong family resemblance to Mr. John Woodriff, which people noticed immediately, declaring they could tell them to be brothers at first sight.\nThe two girls were called down to welcome their uncle Peter and took to him at once. He was so shrewd and yet so kindly-hearted; so grieved at their grief when he came to know of it, that he won his way straight to their hearts.\nDay by day they grew to be better friends. But though he plainly loved them both, Susan Coolin seemed his favourite. The dead load of grief for her twin-sister who was part of herself still lay heavy on the heart of the once gay and frolicsome Milly Woodriff. Now and again for a few happy moments her grief would be forgotten and the bright black eyes would sparkle with their former light, and she would answer her uncle’s quaint jests with saucy liveliness. Now and again a gay verse would start from her lips, spontaneous as the wild bird’s song. But it was only for a moment; the next the sparkle of her eyes would be quenched and the music of her voice hushed by the sad insistent memory of her sorrow.\nBut Susan was of a more placid mood. Grief itself could not ruffle the even gentleness of her nature. They were a curious contrast; the big, rough, shrewd man and the quiet, innocent little maid. But the contrast seemed to have its charm for both.\nPeter Woodriff passed at once into the inner circle of their home-life. So perfect was the charm of his identity that John Woodriff, who was not good at make-belief, often found himself, quite naturally, speaking to him, and even thinking of him, as his brother.\nTo Susan, Peter Woodriff was the kindest of uncles, and she repaid his affection with little innocent confidences concerning her home-life in Liverpool, in which he seemed deeply interested. She told him frankly that she did not like her cousin, Dr. Coleman Woodriff. After a while it came out that the doctor had made love to the shy little maid and frightened her. Presently she was filled with remorse lest she had injured her poor cousin with his rich Uncle Peter, and accused herself of prejudice, and praised the young doctor’s kind heart and cleverness, and told little stories of his doings amongst the poorer patients that showed her praise just.\nSo the weeks slipped by as pleasantly as might be, and Time, the healer, smoothed away the first keen agony of their grief, till even the lurking terror in John Woodriff’s heart was half asleep.\nBrother Peter seemed to enjoy the society of his nieces more than that of his brother, and brother John contentedly allowed him to take his own course.\nThe girls had got the habit of walking out to meet the postman on his way from town, and Uncle Peter never missed the chance of being with them on those occasions. There was a red postal pillar-box, about two-thirds of the way into town, on which he would lean, lazily smoking, while his nieces rifled the postman and shared the spoils.\nOne morning in October, a memorable morning for all concerned, there was an unusually large delivery, and there fell to Milly’s share, in addition to half a dozen letters, the crowning prize of a wedge-shaped box of wedding-cake, neatly tied in white paper and sealed with pale blue sealing-wax.\nThe girls carried their treasures back to the house, and, in the big sitting-room before a bright fire, gossiped over their letters, and read the interesting bits aloud for each other, while their Uncle Peter lounged in an easy rocking-chair, specially imported from town for his delectation, absorbed in newspaper and cigar.\nThe wedding-cake was kept as a bonne bouche for the last.\nMilly cut the string and broke the seal, and got out the card box, tied in the orthodox narrow white ribbon edged liked a saw.\nInside the box lay a card with names in silver letters; the bride’s maiden name run through with a silver arrow.\n“Louisa Thompson!” cried Milly, in surprise and disappointment. “Oh! Susie, look here! I don’t know any Louisa Thompson.”\n“Perhaps some of her friends know you, dear, and sent it. The address is plain enough anyway, and it looks very nice cake.”\n“Then you shall have half,” said Milly generously; “take it yourself, and make a fair division.”\nSusan took the box, and with great deliberation divided the cake into two parts with an ivory paperknife. She turned the cake out on a sheet of notepaper, and tossed the box and its wrappings into the fire. Then she pushed the paper towards Milly, offering her the bigger piece for her share. Very inviting the cake looked, dark on the white paper in two solid wedge-shaped slabs, with a deep selvedge of almond sugar at the thick ends.\nMilly’s fingers were almost on her piece when the big hand of Uncle Peter interposed so quietly and so suddenly that he startled both the girls.\nHe caught the paper by the corner and shifted it round, so that Susan’s piece was towards Milly, and Milly’s piece towards Susan.\n",
      "prompt": "Summarize the following document for Detective story 'The Poisoner' by Unknown. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\n“WE find that Letitia Woodriff was accidentally poisoned by morphia. How taken or administered there is not sufficient evidence before us to show, and we desire to express our profound sympathy with the afflicted father, Mr. Woodriff, in the sad bereavement that has befallen him.”\n* * *\nThe Coroner’s jury could reach no deeper than this in the perplexing mystery. Their verdict given, with grave faces and quiet tread they left the father’s house, where by special favour the inquest had been held.\nThen John Woodriff stole up softly, as though he feared to waken her, to the room where his dead daughter lay, beautiful in death. With a timid gentleness he touched the little hand cold and white on the coverlet. The placid face with the still smile on the pale lips half frightened him. It seemed as if death had lifted his dear little girl—his own familiar pet and plaything—so far above him that even his thoughts could not reach to her now. It was no longer his girl that he had so loved and that so loved him, that lay there so calm and cold. An angel was in the room, pure and placid. His own bright, warm, loving Letty was lost to him for ever.\nWith a spasm of pain that gripped his very heartstrings, he bent over and kissed those poor chill lips passionately. The ice-cold touch stabbed him with a sudden agony of new grief, though his daughter was now two days dead. He pressed his face upon the counterpane, and his deep sobs shook the bed where the placid dead lay.\nThen the door opened softly and a face showed itself at the opening—a young girl’s face, wan and white, with red rims under the eyes.\n“Father,” said a soft voice, replete with tenderness, and Milly Woodriff stole to where her father knelt, shaken by sorrow, and threw her arm round his neck and strove to whisper words of comfort in his ear, though her own heart was breaking.\n“Don’t, father, don’t!” she said; “it would grieve her, even in heaven, to see you thus; she, who was always so gentle, so cheery, and so loving. It’s hard to bear, God knows, it’s hard to bear, but we have each other left to love and live for until we meet our darling again.”\nThe broken-hearted man yielded like a tired child to her caressing touch, and she led him from the room.\n“Thank God, Milly,” he whispered, “you are still left to me,” as they sat together with clasped hands in the big silent sitting-room, where even the sunlight seemed to come sadly now.\nA sudden fear, a pang of sharp remembrance came upon him as he spoke. He caught her hand so tightly that he hurt it. “Oh! my God,” he cried, in a sort of frenzy, “must I lose her too!”\nAfter that he sat for a long time looking at her earnestly, softly stroking the brown silky hair, and all the time a yearning, frightened look in his eyes.\nPresently he seemed to steady himself with an effort, like one who has a purpose in view.\n“Has any one come by the train, Milly?” he asked.\n“The train is hardly in yet, father,” she answered, with a glance at the marble clock on the mantelpiece, “and it’s a good half-hour from town, you know. Do you expect any one?”\n“I wired the day before yesterday to London for a detective—a man named Beck—Paul Beck. We were at school together, and great friends then, though we have not met since. I have heard he is the keenest detective in London. I hoped to have had him down for the inquest. If any man can find out how poor Letty died, he can.”\n“What’s the use, father, of worrying over that now? It will only help to keep the wound open in your heart. It won’t bring our darling back to us.”\n“Milly,” he said, with such earnestness he frightened her, “I would give my right hand this moment to know how death came to poor Letty.”\nThere was silence again. Presently he asked abruptly, “Where is Susan?”\n“In her room, father, utterly broken down. She has hardly eaten or slept since. In some things Susan is like a little child, and she and Letty were such friends!”\n“Go to her, my dear. You will comfort each other. I’m restless and impatient for this man to come. I’ll walk down a bit of the road and meet him.”\nMr. Woodriff’s house was a tall, red-brick building that looked out from the breast of a wooded slope far over the sea. About three miles inland was the large and prosperous town of Deringham, where Mr. Woodriff, as an ironmaster, had acquired the ample fortune which enabled him to purchase the house and grounds of Merview, and live in comfort on the borders of the sea which he had loved from a boy.\nAs he strode steadily down the high-road, half-way between the town and his house, a hansom went past him rapidly. One quick glance showed him seated in it a placid, dull-looking man, whom he at once set down as a commercial traveller. But the hansom pulled up sharply before it had got twenty yards past. The dull-looking man leaped out like a schoolboy and ran back towards him, calling his name.\n“Don’t you know me, Jack?” he cried cordially, with hand outstretched. “I knew you at first sight.”\nMr. Woodriff looked for a moment bewildered; then a light dawned on him. “Surely you cannot be little Paul Beck?” he cried.\n“Little or great, I’m Paul Beck as surely as you are John Woodriff—the very same Paul Beck you saved from many a basting at school when I was a small boy, and you were a big one. I’m heartily sorry, Jack, that our first meeting again should be such a sad one.”\n“You got my wire, then?”\n“And your letter; both the same time. I was out of town when the wire came or I should have been down for the inquest. What was the verdict?”\n“Accidental death.”\nMr. Beck glanced at his face. “And what do you think yourself?”\n“I really don’t know what to think.”\nAgain Mr. Beck looked at him keenly and steadily. “You are horribly cut up, Jack, and all of a shiver. There is something else besides grief troubling you; something frightening you. I’ll send the cab on to the house; we will talk this thing out while we walk. I always feel most alone where there are no walls.”\nThey walked on together for a few moments without a word, till they came to a by-path on the left hand that led straight to the sea. They turned off the higher road, still without speaking. Mr. Woodriff’s face was haggard and perplexed and his eyes on the ground, and Mr. Beck glanced at him now and again as if striving to read his thoughts. The by-road took them out on a broad stretch of smooth strand. Beyond this to the sky-line the sea lay sparkling, and the long, clear ripples split themselves on the sand, foaming softly like champagne. At their back the cliffs rose in a black wall.\n“What is it?” asked Mr. Beck abruptly, as they walked close to the sea’s margin.\n“I’m afraid.”\n“Afraid of what?”\n“I don’t know of what or of whom, but I’m in deadly terror that my daughter Milly—my only daughter now—may be taken from me. Letty is not the first that has been poisoned. I dread she may not be the last.” He was trembling all over.\nMr. Beck took his arm. “Jack,” he said quietly, “if I can help you, I will, for old times’ sake, if for nothing else. Things may seem blacker to you than they really are. Tell me straight out what you know and what you fear.”\n“It’s a long story, Paul.”\nIt was curious how naturally the old schoolfellows dropped into the tone and names of a quarter of a century ago.\n“I’m in no hurry. Tell it your own way, but tell the whole of it.”\n“Only a year ago my eldest daughter Barbara died suddenly at school in the south of Germany. The telegram announcing her death miscarried, and she was buried before I arrived. The doctor said it was heart disease. I didn’t doubt it at the time; I had no reason to doubt it. But now I’m sure she was poisoned with morphia, as poor Letty was poisoned. It happened just the same way. Babs had been quite well all the morning, and breakfasted with the other girls. After breakfast she went to her room to read her letters from home. An hour later they found her lying back, huddled up in an easy-chair. They thought her sleeping, but she was dead.”\n“Your daughter Letty died in the same way?”\n“Precisely. Her twin-sister, Milly, and her cousin, Susan Coolin, who is on a visit with us, were at a young peoples’ party at the other side of the town, and stayed overnight. Letty insisted on remaining at home with me. We breakfasted together, and she was full of life and spirits. She was expecting a letter from an old schoolfellow, and she walked into town to meet the postman. We were together as far as the turn to the sea. I went out for a few hours’ mackerel fishing. She kept the road towards the town. Twenty yards away she turned smilingly to kiss hands to me as I passed the corner. I never saw her alive again.\n“When I returned the house was in an uproar of alarm and grief. The girls had just returned, and found Letty lying half across her bed, as if she had fallen on it, dead. At the inquest morphia poison was proved. She must have taken nearly ten grains of pure morphia the doctor declared—enough to cause death in less than half an hour.”\n“Had your daughters any love affairs?”\n“None that I ever heard of. They are very young—poor Letty wasn’t eighteen; a perfect schoolgirl. Did I tell you that she and Milly were twins? Babs was about the same age when she died—when she was poisoned in Germany.”\n“They were cheery girls, you say?”\n“As gay as larks. You may put suicide out of your head, if that is what you are thinking of.”\n“Suicide and accident dismissed; then we come to murder. Who were in the house when your daughter Letty was poisoned?”\n“Family servants, every man and woman of them. I’d as soon think of suspecting myself. Besides, there was no motive, and they all loved her.”\nSomething in the way the word “motive” was said caught Mr. Beck’s quick ear.\nHe turned round and faced John Woodriff there on the lonely sand, breaking off their walk abruptly.\n“What are you hiding from me, Jack? What motive do you know for this crime?”\n“I know of none.”\n“What do you guess, then? Come, be frank if I am to help you.”\n“The very thought is so preposterous—so horrible—that I don’t like even to put it in words. Besides, it is impossible.”\n“Let me judge of that. By clearing the impossibles out of the way we come to the possibles.”\n“I must go back a bit, then, to explain. You may remember we Woodriffs were five in family; four brothers and a sister. The eldest, Robert, became a doctor and settled down in Liverpool. He put his only son, Coleman Woodriff, to the same profession, and left him his practice—not a very good one, by all accounts—when he died. My second brother, Peter, has been in Chicago for thirty years, a bachelor, doing well and promising every year to pay us a visit. But he has nothing to do with what I have to say to you. The two youngest were myself and Dick. Dick always hated Robert like poison, but he and I were the best of friends till, as ill-luck would have it, we fell in love with the same girl. We fought our battle out fairly, like brothers, for her love, and I won! Poor Alice! No man ever had a better wife, but she died after the twins were born. I loved the little ones the dearer for her sake. Dick never got over his grief. He didn’t quarrel with me—he was too decent a chap for that—but he threw up his business; he was doing well as a stockbroker in Liverpool, and went to Australia, and stayed there till he died about three years ago. He speculated recklessly in land and building lots. But everything turned up trumps for him—crossed in love, you know the proverb—and he made a big pile.\n“He and I were good friends to the very last. He wrote every other post. He was very fond of the girls—for Alice’s sake, I think, as much as mine—constantly sent them handsome presents, and when he died he left them every farthing he had in the world, close on a quarter of a million.”\n“Share and share alike?”\n“Share and share alike, or to the survivors or survivor after they reached the age of eighteen years.”\nMr. Beck whistled under his breath. “If none reached the age of eighteen?” he asked, after a pause.\n“There was no provision in the will for that. I suppose poor Dick never thought of that. But I have consulted a lawyer about it. He tells me that if my three daughters should die under eighteen there is an ‘intestacy,’ and as the property is what he calls ‘real,’ that is houses and lands, it all goes to Dr. Coleman Woodriff, as heir-at-law to the deceased.”\n“Here’s our motive, anyway,” said Mr. Beck, “clear enough and strong enough.”\n“But the thing is preposterous,” protested Mr. Woodriff earnestly, “admitting that the man, my brother’s son, could be such a devil, and I won’t and don’t admit it!

Grief itself could not ruffle the even gentleness of her nature. They were a curious contrast; the big, rough, shrewd man and the quiet, innocent little maid. But the contrast seemed to have its charm for both.\nPeter Woodriff passed at once into the inner circle of their home-life. So perfect was the charm of his identity that John Woodriff, who was not good at make-belief, often found himself, quite naturally, speaking to him, and even thinking of him, as his brother.\nTo Susan, Peter Woodriff was the kindest of uncles, and she repaid his affection with little innocent confidences concerning her home-life in Liverpool, in which he seemed deeply interested. She told him frankly that she did not like her cousin, Dr. Coleman Woodriff. After a while it came out that the doctor had made love to the shy little maid and frightened her. Presently she was filled with remorse lest she had injured her poor cousin with his rich Uncle Peter, and accused herself of prejudice, and praised the young doctor’s kind heart and cleverness, and told little stories of his doings amongst the poorer patients that showed her praise just.\nSo the weeks slipped by as pleasantly as might be, and Time, the healer, smoothed away the first keen agony of their grief, till even the lurking terror in John Woodriff’s heart was half asleep.\nBrother Peter seemed to enjoy the society of his nieces more than that of his brother, and brother John contentedly allowed him to take his own course.\nThe girls had got the habit of walking out to meet the postman on his way from town, and Uncle Peter never missed the chance of being with them on those occasions. There was a red postal pillar-box, about two-thirds of the way into town, on which he would lean, lazily smoking, while his nieces rifled the postman and shared the spoils.\nOne morning in October, a memorable morning for all concerned, there was an unusually large delivery, and there fell to Milly’s share, in addition to half a dozen letters, the crowning prize of a wedge-shaped box of wedding-cake, neatly tied in white paper and sealed with pale blue sealing-wax.\nThe girls carried their treasures back to the house, and, in the big sitting-room before a bright fire, gossiped over their letters, and read the interesting bits aloud for each other, while their Uncle Peter lounged in an easy rocking-chair, specially imported from town for his delectation, absorbed in newspaper and cigar.\nThe wedding-cake was kept as a bonne bouche for the last.\nMilly cut the string and broke the seal, and got out the card box, tied in the orthodox narrow white ribbon edged liked a saw.\nInside the box lay a card with names in silver letters; the bride’s maiden name run through with a silver arrow.\n“Louisa Thompson!” cried Milly, in surprise and disappointment. “Oh! Susie, look here! I don’t know any Louisa Thompson.”\n“Perhaps some of her friends know you, dear, and sent it. The address is plain enough anyway, and it looks very nice cake.”\n“Then you shall have half,” said Milly generously; “take it yourself, and make a fair division.”\nSusan took the box, and with great deliberation divided the cake into two parts with an ivory paperknife. She turned the cake out on a sheet of notepaper, and tossed the box and its wrappings into the fire. Then she pushed the paper towards Milly, offering her the bigger piece for her share. Very inviting the cake looked, dark on the white paper in two solid wedge-shaped slabs, with a deep selvedge of almond sugar at the thick ends.\nMilly’s fingers were almost on her piece when the big hand of Uncle Peter interposed so quietly and so suddenly that he startled both the girls.\nHe caught the paper by the corner and shifted it round, so that Susan’s piece was towards Milly, and Milly’s piece towards Susan.\n\n\nProvide a comprehensive summary (between 600 and 900 words long) of the key events, information, and important details from this document."

    "final_summary": "“The Poisoner” is a gripping detective story centered around the mysterious and tragic poisoning of Letitia Woodriff, the beloved daughter of John Woodriff. The narrative opens with the somber concluding statement by the Coroner’s jury, which finds that Letitia, affectionately called Letty, was accidentally poisoned by morphia. However, the exact means of how the poison was taken or administered remains unclear, leaving the case unresolved and steeped in sorrow. The jury expresses sympathy to the grieving father, setting a tone of profound loss and unanswered questions.\n\nJohn Woodriff’s heartbreak is portrayed with poignant intimacy. He visits Letty’s room after the inquest, where she lies dead, serene and beautiful in death. His grief is overwhelming—he touches her cold hand, kisses her icy lips, and sobs uncontrollably. Milly, Letty’s twin sister, gently comforts their father, reminding him that letting despair consume him would grieve Letty even in heaven. The siblings’ shared pain and tenderness highlight the emotional core of the story. John then reveals his deep fear that Milly, now his only remaining daughter, may also be in danger, as Letty is not the first to be poisoned in their family.\n\nTo investigate this dire suspicion, John has summoned Paul Beck, an old schoolfriend turned esteemed London detective, known for his keen intellect. Beck arrives after the inquest, and their reunion reveals old camaraderie juxtaposed against the dark present crisis. As they walk along the seaside near the Woodriff estate, John confides his fears and recounts the bizarre, frightening deaths that have befallen his family. Only a year earlier, his eldest daughter Barbara died suddenly at school in Germany under similar circumstances, originally diagnosed as heart disease but now suspected to have been poisoning by morphia, like Letty’s death.\n\nJohn describes the circumstances of Letty’s death in detail: Letty was lively and well the morning she died, had breakfast with Milly and a cousin, Susan Coolin, who is visiting from Liverpool, and remained home while the others went to a party. Letty was awaiting a letter and went into town to meet the postman. Soon after, she was found dead on her bed, having apparently taken a fatal dose of morphia — approximately ten grains, enough to cause death rapidly. No suicide motive was deemed plausible given Letty’s bright and cheerful demeanor, and no servants or family members present were suspected due to their affection for her and absence of motive.\n\nThe possible motive emerges from John’s family history and inheritance complications. The Woodriff family originally comprised five siblings, but two brothers, Dick and Robert, are now deceased. Dick, who died three years ago after a successful but reckless business career, left his sizable fortune to John’s three daughters, on condition they reach adulthood. Otherwise, the inheritance would revert to a cousin, Dr. Coleman Woodriff, Robert’s son and a Liverpool doctor of good reputation but a potentially dubious beneficiary. Although John trusts Coleman and dismisses any foul play on his part, Paul Beck is alert to the inheritance as a strong motive for murder, despite John’s protests.\n\nPaul Beck’s investigatory methodicalness is demonstrated when he examines Letty’s room, finding carefully concealed clues among the ashes of burned papers, dust sweepings, and fragments of items including a melted piece of blue glass, half-burned pasteboard, antique gold ring, notched white ribbon, colorful silk threads, and hairpins. These cryptic findings suggest hidden correspondence or evidence related to the murder, indicating intricate plotting or concealment.\n\nSoon after, Beck returns disguised as Peter Woodriff, the Woodriff brother who resides in Chicago. This bold ruse allows him to observe the household and its inhabitants without raising suspicion. His assumed identity is so convincing that even John Woodriff, despite his usual difficulty with pretense, accepts him as his brother, and the girls grow fond of their “uncle,” especially Susan Coolin, who is shy, innocent, and deeply affected by Letty’s death. Susan confides her dislike for Dr. Coleman Woodriff, a sentiment she struggles to reconcile with his kind actions, which adds complexity to the character dynamics and possible tensions.\n\nAs the days pass, Beck-as-Peter becomes a fixture in the household, participating in daily life and gaining trust. Milly sometimes brightens, though her grief remains palpable, while Susan maintains a steady, gentle presence. The familial relationships and social interactions are portrayed with subtlety, showing Beck’s immersion in the case and environment.\n\nAn evocative episode centers around a particular morning when the postman delivers an unusually large batch of letters and packages, including a wedge-shaped box of wedding cake addressed to “Louisa Thompson.” This cake seems innocent but carries significance, as Beck’s careful observation of its arrival and the ribbon used sparks intrigue. Milly and Susan share the cake by cutting it into two pieces, but Uncle Peter quietly intervenes, switching the pieces between them with a subtle gesture, hinting at his awareness and suspicion about the contents or message embedded in this gift, and underscoring the tension of concealed dangers.\n\nThroughout the story, key themes emerge: grief and familial love, the shadow of inheritance motives, the pervasive fear of an unseen poisoner, and the interplay of trust and suspicion within intimate relationships. The narrative builds a suspenseful atmosphere marked by layers of mystery—each new revelation deepens the enigma of Letty’s death and the potential threat to Milly.\n\nPaul Beck’s calm, analytical presence contrasts with John Woodriff’s wild grief and mounting terror, embodying the rational pursuit of truth amid emotional turmoil. Beck’s strategic decision to infiltrate the household in disguise demonstrates ingenuity and a firm commitment to uncovering the murderer before the tragic pattern claims another victim.\n\nIn conclusion, “The Poisoner” is a richly textured detective story that explores a family haunted by suspicious deaths, where grief, fear, and suspicion intertwine. The unexpected deaths of two daughter figures—Letty and Barbara—both attributed to morphia poisoning, prompt a desperate investigation fueled by inheritance motives and simmering family resentments. Through careful observation, disguise, and psychological insight, detective Paul Beck begins to unravel the mystery, probing hidden messages and secrets concealed within a mourning household on the windswept coast. The story ends poised on the brink of further revelations, with Beck’s subtle interventions hinting at the unraveling of the poisoner’s sinister design and a fight to protect the surviving daughter Milly from a grave, lurking peril.",
