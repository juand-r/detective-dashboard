    "full_text": "\"Tracked by Teeth\" unfolds as a gripping detective narrative centered on a chilling murder in a London boarding house near the British Museum, an area once distinguished by grand eighteenth-century residences, now largely inhabited by modest lodgers. The story opens on a summer morning bathed in sunlight, exposing a somber, incongruous room where old wood panelling and a sixteenth-century mirror clash with vulgar modern prints and mismatched furniture. This setting becomes the scene of a grim discovery that jolts the household and later envelops the city in intrigue.\n\nIn this room, the lifeless body of a woman is found hidden in a wardrobe with visible bloodstains smeared across the carpet, bed linens, and pillows, marking the gravity of the crime. The victim, a woman about thirty-five years old, was murdered just four days prior, likely stabbed to death while asleep in the bed. The cruelty and suddenness of the murder contrast deeply with the otherwise quiet boarding house. The victim's body shows multiple stab wounds inflicted with a broken, ornate blade typical of Southern Europe, suggesting a violent and deliberate attack. The knife, left bloodied on the floor, indicates the killers were nervous and unsteady. \n\nBefore the murder, three visitors, identifying themselves as the Luchessi family—an Italian gentleman, his “wife,” and a young woman claiming to be his sister—had arrived seeking lodging. They rented the largest bedroom, the very room where the tragedy later unfolded, along with a smaller bedroom and a sitting room. They paid a month’s rent upfront and appeared reserved and reclusive, isolating themselves from others in the house. Their luggage was minimal, which at the time seemed unremarkable, but later aroused suspicion given the crime.\n\nOn the morning of the discovery, the absence of the Luchessis was noticed. When the chambermaid, Alice Worthington, found their door unlocked and the bloodstained bed sheets, alarm grew rapidly. The landlady and her husband soon confirmed the presence of blood soaked into the bed and on the pillows. The body’s ghastly concealment inside the wardrobe emerged only when Mr. Ravel opened its door. This shattering moment unleashed panic and calls for help; police and a doctor were summoned, authorities notified, and the news exploded throughout London and beyond, igniting a widespread manhunt.\n\nTyler Tatlock, the detective entrusted with the investigation, is portrayed deep in thought amid the crime scene’s lingering disturbances. Committed to assembling a coherent narrative from scant clues, Tatlock intuits a carefully planned murder executed by the Luchessis, implicating the man and his supposed sister as conspirators. The victim’s body, crammed into the wardrobe after death, likely was an effort to prevent blood from staining floors below. Tatlock deduces a distinct involvement between the two women and the gentleman in successive stabbing blows, the last and fatal attack delivered with brute force by the man. \n\nImportant forensic and circumstantial evidence supports Tatlock’s deductions. The broken blade weapon, the spilled perfume bottle containing continental scent, and the scattered English coins around a chair imply a chaotic but deliberate act interrupted by nervous haste. Among the coins lay a small gold plate fitted with three artificial front teeth, a detail Tatlock highlights for suspect identification, theorizing the man might have missing front teeth. Other belongings like a foreign hairbrush and travel rug confirm the outsiders’ continental origins. Clothes recovered feature Italian corsets labeled from Milan and Bond Street shoes purchased a week earlier with a newly recorded five-pound note, tying the victim’s wardrobe and movements closely to these individuals.\n\nTatlock’s investigation broadens to tracing the ten-pound note used during the footwear purchase. It was linked to a French bank’s London branch, which had recently conducted a large transaction with a Signora Valetta Luchessi bearing letters of credit totaling nearly three thousand pounds. The day before the murder, this woman had withdrawn a significant sum in gold, assisted by a cab—a vehicle also used to bring the Luchessis to the boarding house. Their flight after the crime was presumed to involve an early morning escape to one of several ‘boat train’ departures leading to continental Europe. The limited luggage and hurried departure reinforced suspicions that the foreigners intended to vanish quickly.\n\nFurther testimonial evidence notes the victim was adorned with costly jewellery—rings, a gold watch, brooches, pearls worn in her hair—but all valuables were missing, suggesting robbery as a likely motive alongside murder. Curiously, a wedding-ring that was too tight was left undisturbed on her finger, hinting at the robbers’ limits or haste. Tatlock, while piecing together motives, struggles but leans toward plunder as the primary cause underpinning the crime, dismissing other possibilities due to the calculated nature of the murder and flight.\n\nThe Luchessis’ personalities and behaviors strike the landlady and servants as odd but not overtly alarming. Their reserved demeanor, avoidance of interaction, and efficient but shy conduct conceal the deadly intentions beneath. Such cold and calculated criminality particularly fascinates Tatlock. The purported relationship between the man and the two women is accepted at face value, although he remains alert to the possibility of aliases, deception, or further conspiracies.\n\nAs newspapers nationwide clamor for details, sensationalizing what they dub the \"Tragedy in Blank Street,\" the investigation intensifies. The press’s voracious appetite for twists and rumors adds pressure on Tatlock and the police to solve the case quickly before the fugitives vanish beyond reach. Tatlock’s combination of forensic insight, sharp observation, and the subtle reading of human behavior becomes key to unravelling the web surrounding the murder.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Tracked by Teeth\" is a detective story rooted deeply in forensic detail and logical deduction, painting a stark image of betrayal, cold-blooded murder, and the complexities of tracing foreign fugitives in bustling London. The use of small but telling evidence—blood patterns, broken knife blades, coins, artificial teeth, and financial transactions—builds a vivid tapestry from which the detective attempts to reconstruct the crime and identify the culprits. The narrative underscores themes of deception, disguise, and human greed while illustrating the painstaking intelligence work that underpins effective criminal investigations.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Identify what is fact and what is conjecture\n • Facts: the corpse is a woman of c. 35, stabbed many times in the bed in the Luchessis’ main bedroom; her jewels and the gold she drew from the bank the previous day are gone; a Southern-European ornamental knife (broken in the attack), a puddle of foreign scent, scattered English coins, and a small gold plate carrying three artificial upper front teeth are left on the floor.  \n • Facts: three people calling themselves “the Luchessi family” had rented the only rooms that give direct access to the place where the body was found; they paid a month in advance, travelled light, avoided acquaintance, and disappeared during the night that immediately followed the murder.  \n • Facts: a ten-pound note they spent on shoes leads back to Signora Valetta Luchessi, who had letters of credit for c. £3,000 and drew a large sum in gold the afternoon before she was killed.  \n • Observations: the body was hidden hurriedly in a wardrobe, presumably to arrest blood-flow to the floor beneath; the wounds are of differing force—light hesitating cuts followed by a last vicious thrust.  \n • Observation: the false teeth on the carpet indicate that one of the killers now lacks three upper incisors.  \n\n2. Work out motive\n • Robbery is obvious: the cash and jewels have vanished.  \n • But WHOSE money was it?  The bank records prove it was Signora Valetta’s own property.  If she is the victim, the murder converts the cash from her property to her husband’s pocket.  \n • If a stranger had killed her, he would need to know she had just collected several hundred sovereigns; only her two intimates (husband & “sister”) possessed that knowledge.  \n ⇒ The most reasonable motive is elimination of the lawful owner (the wife) by the husband who covets the money, helped by the young woman who pretends to be his sister but is far more probably his lover.\n\n3. Opportunity\n • No one except the three Italians had access to the locked suite during the night.  \n • Landlady, landlord and maid all slept two floors below and have alibis that check with each other and with the time of death (≈ 2 a.m.).  \n • Hence only the husband and the “sister” could be in the room at the critical hour without forcing an entry.\n\n4. Physical evidence\n • Knife: a Florentine paper-knife that had ornamented the Italian gentleman’s writing-case seen earlier by the chambermaid when she carried up coal.  \n • Perfume: unmistakably continental and recognised by the same maid as coming from the young lady’s dressing-table.  \n • False teeth: the landlord remembers the gentleman’s “bright gold stopping” in his smile; after the murder he will be conspicuous by three missing upper teeth.  \n • Money trail: the bank links the cash withdrawal to Signora Valetta; the cabman who fetched the gold is the same who brought the trio and their trunks to the house.  \n • Flight: only the two survivors run; the third trunk (the wife’s) is left behind because its owner is dead.\n\n5. Alibis\n • None are offered by the two fugitives; everyone else is ruled out by place and time.\n\nLogical chain\n 1. Wife draws a fortune in gold.  \n 2. Same night she is found butchered in the very bed she shared with her husband.  \n 3. Husband and “sister” carry off the gold and jewels, abandon the corpse, and vanish on the first morning train for the Continent.  \n 4. All scene objects (knife, scent, teeth) belong to the two runaways.  \n 5. Therefore they are the killers; the wife is the victim.\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSignor “Luchessi” (Italian gentleman, real name unknown), Signora Valetta Luchessi (wife), Young woman posing as his sister (real name unknown), Mrs. Ravel (landlady), Mr. Ravel (landlord), Alice Worthington (chambermaid), Unknown outsider/burglar\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nSignor “Luchessi” (alias; Italian gentleman, wearer of gold plate false teeth)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nThe young woman posing as his “sister” (alias unknown; lover and co-conspirator)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Friday, 2 p.m. – Signora Valetta Luchessi visits the London branch of the French bank, cashes letters of credit worth several hundred sovereigns, and is driven back to Blank Street in a four-wheeler accompanied by her husband and the young woman.  \n2. That evening – An angry quarrel breaks out in the sitting-room; the husband and the “sister” have long plotted to rid themselves of the wife and seize her fortune.  Final details are fixed: strike while she sleeps, hide the body, flee at dawn.  \n3. 2 a.m. – The girl sprinkles scent to mask the smell of blood and steadies the victim’s head; the man uses the ornamental Florentine blade from his desk for the initial blows.  His hand wavers, the blade snaps, so he drives the jagged stump deep into the chest, killing his wife.  In the struggle his gold plate denture is dislodged and drops to the carpet.  \n4. 2:15-3:00 a.m. – They strip off the jewels, pocket the sovereigns, drag the corpse into the wardrobe, turn the mattress, remake the bed, yet cannot erase all the blood.  \n5. 4:30 a.m. – With only two valises (cash, jewels, few clothes) they slip out, catch the first boat-train from Charing Cross to Dover, and cross to Calais before the murder is discovered.  \n6. Monday morning – The maid finds the stained sheets and sounds the alarm; police arrive; Tatlock pieces together the evidence and circulates descriptions of an Italian man now lacking three front teeth and a dark-haired girl of twenty-two travelling under a false surname with a heavy swag of jewellery and gold.\n\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Signora Valetta Luchessi – She is the victim, proved by bank records showing the withdrawn gold was hers and by the blood-pattern indicating the person who usually slept in that side of the bed was the one attacked.  \n• Mrs. and Mr. Ravel – Were asleep two floors below; no blood on their clothes; no motive; they raised the alarm and voluntarily opened all rooms to police.  \n• Alice Worthington – Merely the discoverer; her fingerprints are confined to the door-handle and the linen she handled in her normal duties; she had neither knowledge of the large cash withdrawal nor the physical chance to enter the locked suite that night.  \n• Unknown outsider/burglar – No sign of forced entry, no attempt to ransack the house beyond the one suite, and only the two fugitives knew of the newly acquired fortune.  An outsider would not leave behind personal dentures nor choose a distinctly Italian knife that was known to be in the gentleman’s possession.\n\nTherefore all evidence converges on Signor “Luchessi” as the prime mover and his alleged sister as his willing helper.  No other resident had the motive, opportunity, or forensic link to the crime.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "text": "THE sun of a summer morning streamed through the open window of a London house, and lighted up a sombrely furnished room. It was an unusually large room; the walls were lined with a wooden panelling, and there was a large old-fashioned fireplace, with a carved wooden mantel-piece, on which stood some trumpery ornaments, but over it was suspended a small oval-shaped sixteenth-century mirror. In striking contrast to this some cheap and vulgar coloured prints were hung on the walls. Nor was this the only incongruity, for old and modern furniture were mixed without any regard for taste or art.\nIn a spacious chair, in an attitude of profound thought, sat a man, his left elbow leaning on the arm of the chair, his index finger laid upon his temples. His eyes, scarcely visible, seemed fixed on space.\nThe sunlight streaming in fell upon a ponderous mahogany wardrobe, the door of which stood open. On the floor of the wardrobe was a large blotch as of spilled liquor, of a reddish-brown tint, and in the immediate front of the wardrobe the carpet bore a similar stain, although not so easily detected as that in the wardrobe. And the stain was the stain of blood—of human blood. It had soaked into the carpet and was not yet properly dry, and if the hand had touched that part it would have been reddened. There were two windows in the room. Opposite the one that was not opened stood a quaint four-post bedstead. The bedclothes were turned down. The bed had evidently been occupied recently, and the undersheet was a ghastly sight, for it was stained with a huge patch, irregular and uneven. The stain was also a stain of blood—human blood. The pillows were splashed, and on one could clearly be traced the impress of blood-wetted fingers.\nThe house was one of the large old-fashioned residences which are still to be found in the neighbourhood of the British Museum, and were the town abodes of fashion during the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century. But nowadays they are for the most part occupied by indigent people, who eke out their existence by letting apartments. Not a few of these noble houses have been the scenes of strange comedies of real life, and of grim tragedy, but no grimmer tragedy had surely ever been enacted than that which had produced those bloodstains in the sunlit room.\nYes, a tragedy! A woman, only four days agone, had been foully and cruelly slain as—there was no doubt about it—she lay in bed. And when life had ebbed away, or it might have been before it had gone, her body had been thrust into the wardrobe, where the blood continued to ooze before rigor mortis set in. Her age was guessed at about thirty-five. She was exceedingly well developed, well nourished, good-looking, with a great quantity of very dark, almost jet-black hair. It was a case of murder, and even at that moment when the sun filled the room with a brilliant light the coroner's jury was holding the necessary legal inquiry, and the mortal remains of the victim were lying stark and stiff in the parish mortuary.\nExactly a fortnight before the ghastly discovery of the woman's doubled-up body in the wardrobe, a 'gentleman' of fair speech and manners, and sartorially respectable, called in company with a lady, whom he represented as his wife, to inquire about apartments. The tenants of the house, a Mr. and Mrs. Ravel, took in boarding lodgers. The lady and gentleman were foreigners. They gave their names as Luchessi, which is Italian, but they spoke English well, though with an accent. They wanted two bedrooms and a sitting-room. The reason for two bedrooms was, as the gentleman explained, his sister was to arrive that night or the next morning. They were on a visit of pleasure to the British metropolis, and expected to remain for three or four weeks. The best bedroom in the house—the room in which the tragedy was enacted—was vacant, and a smaller one on the other side of the passage, and a small sitting-room on the first floor. 'Nothing,' said the gentleman, could suit them better.' The only meal they would take in the house, probably, would be breakfast. When asked for a reference or a deposit, the gentleman readily pulled out a well-filled purse, and paid a whole month in advance. Nothing could have been more satisfactory to the landlady, who was only concerned in getting her rent. Lodgers came and went. Hers was the class of house where people did not stay long. To her they were mere passing shadows, in whom she took no interest beyond the amount of rent they stipulated to pay during their temporary sojourn under her roof. The gentleman incidentally, as it seemed, remarked that he and his wife had little luggage with them, as, being merely on a flying visit, they had not burdened themselves with anything beyond what was absolutely essential.\nHaving settled the preliminaries, Mr. and Mrs. Luchessi went away, saying they would return in the evening. Accordingly, about seven o'clock, they drove up in a four-wheeled cab with a third person, a young woman, who was represented as the husband's sister, and whose name was given as 'Miss Bella Luchessi.' They had with them a small portmanteau, a couple of handbags, and a bundle of rugs. Having deposited their things in their respective rooms, they went out almost immediately, and did not return until midnight.\nAs the day went on, the landlady felt very satisfied with her new guests, although she thought they were perhaps a little eccentric and unduly reserved. They never associated with anyone else in the house. They were quiet, apparently shy, and gave no trouble. They seldom rose before midday. Then they partook of breakfast, which invariably consisted of coffee and bread. After that they went out, and generally returned late. So much and little more did the landlady know of her foreign visitors when the household was stunned by the discovery of the crime. At noon on the day of the discovery the Luchessis had not appeared. Nor were there any signs of them at one o'clock. A chambermaid named Alice Worthington thereupon tapped on Mr. and Mrs. Luchessi's door, and, getting no response, she returned in about a quarter of an hour with the same result. Something induced her to turn the handle. The door, to her surprise, was not locked. She peeped into the room. It was empty. The bed was disarranged, and there was some confusion of portions of the furniture. The girl's attention was drawn to the pillows, which seemed stained in a suspicious manner. She turned the upper clothes down, and started back with horror as she saw that the sheet was saturated with blood. Scarcely able to repress a scream, she tore down breathlessly to her mistress and made known what she had seen. Upstairs went Mr. and Mrs. Ravel to verify the statement, followed by the girl. Yes; it was true enough. The sheet was wet with blood, which had soaked through to the mattress. The landlady ran off to Miss Luchessi's room. That was empty too, but there was no blood there. A scream rang through the house. She rushed back to the big bedroom, to find that her servant had fallen to the floor in a fainting fit, while her husband stood almost spellbound. He had, not knowing what he was going to reveal, opened the wardrobe door, and there, doubled up, was the body of Mrs. Luchessi.\n'Murder; my God, murder!' seemed to thrill through the air and fall on the ears of all, and there was an instinctive shrinking back and a general shuddering.\nIt is an ugly word, no matter when and where uttered. But when, as in this case, it is the exclamatory outburst of horror begotten by the sight of the victim and the victim's blood, its ugliness is intensified. Mr. Ravel recovered his presence of mind.\n'Run quickly and get hold of a policeman,' was his order; and the servants, as if only too glad to hurry away from that now accursed room, went pell-mell down the stairs. Then the man picked up Alice Worthington, bore her to a sofa in another room, and bade his wife attend to her, and he himself went down to the street door, where he awaited the arrival of a constable, to whom he quickly imparted the startling news. The two went upstairs, and in a few minutes a doctor, who lived close by, and had been summoned by one of the alarmed servants, followed them. He did not disturb the body, but satisfied himself that life was absolutely extinct. The three retired. Nothing in the room was disturbed. The door was locked, and an intimation of the occurrence conveyed without loss of time to the proper authorities, and in a very short time the telegraph wires were flashing the news of the crime to every seaport, every railway station in London, and every town of importance in the kingdom. From the first it was seen that the murder was one of a somewhat unusual character, and it was deemed probable that the suspected parties, being foreigners, would get out of the country with the least possible delay. Tyler Tatlock was communicated with, and he was urgently requested to try and get on the track of the fugitives.\nThe man referred to at the opening of this narrative as sitting in a thoughtful attitude in the room where the crime had been committed was Tyler Tatlock himself. He was endeavouring to work out a rational theory for the crime. To him it seemed clear that the murder was a deliberate and deeply-planned one. Three foreigners arrived with very little luggage—nothing but what they could conveniently carry about with them. That in itself was a suspicious circumstance when considered in connection with other things. The woman who passed as Bella Luchessi was, as seemed pretty evident, in league with the man, and if she did not actually kill the other woman she was an accessory to the crime. The object in placing the dead body in the wardrobe was not quite clear, except on one hypothesis. When the body was discovered life had been extinct, according to the medical report, about eight or nine hours. It was two o'clock when the discovery was made.\nShe had, therefore, probably been killed about six or even before. Anyway, the criminals had gone off without anyone in the house hearing them.\nThe victim had been stabbed to death as she lay in bed, and possibly while she was asleep. There were indications that the murderer was nervous, and his or her hand unsteady. The woman had been struck in the first instance on the right side, but the knife was turned by the ribs. Another blow had then been aimed full at the bosom, and the weapon had come in contact with the breast bone, the tip of the blade being broken off, and subsequently recovered during the post mortem examination. Notwithstanding that the weapon was now pointless it had been driven with great force into the left breast, and perforated the pericardium. There must have been a tremendous flow of blood from the three wounds, and Tatlock's deduction was that the body had been removed and placed in the wardrobe to prevent the blood soaking through the bed on to the floor, and so through to the ceiling of the room underneath.\nAnother deduction of his was this. The first and second blow was struck by a woman's hand—Bella Luchessi's. The third and fatal blow, in which great force must have been exerted, by the man. The weapon used was one common in Italy, Spain, and Portugal—a fine blade, about six inches long, shutting up in a handle like a clasp-knife. By touching a spring the blade can be made to fly out, and the knife then forms a dagger of a very formidable kind. This knife, very much bloodstained, had been picked up on the floor between the bed and the wall, showing pretty conclusively that the criminals had become confused, and had lost their heads. There was further evidence of this in a scent-bottle which had been capsized on the dressing-table. The glass stopper of the bottle had come out, rolled to the floor, and the contents of the bottle had been spilled. The scent was frangipanni, a perfume much affected by Continental women.\nWhen the crime was committed the man was not dressed. He had drawn on his trousers afterwards, while his mind was confused and his nerves unstrung. Tatlock came to this conclusion from the fact that round about and beneath a cane-bottom chair at the foot of the bed several English coins were picked up. In drawing on his trousers the contents of a pocket had tumbled out, and he must have been so preoccupied that he did not observe that the coins had fallen. Amongst the money were two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, some silver and coppers. Now, unless a man had been suffering from great mental excitement, he would hardly have left this money scattered about the floor. But what was still stronger evidence of the condition of his mind was that with the coins was a small gold plate with three artificial teeth—front teeth—attached. Tatlock regarded that as of great importance as a clue, and he advised the authorities in describing the man to say that it was probable three of his front teeth were missing. Nothing else was left behind by the fugitives, except a hair-brush, found in the room occupied by Bella Luchessi, and an old travelling-rug. Both of these articles were of foreign make, as was the murdered woman's clothing, which was lying on a couch. The corsets, linen, and other articles were of good quality, and all foreign. The corsets bore the name of a Milan maker. The stockings were English, and had been worn for the first time. And a pair of almost new shoes had the name of a Bond Street shoemaker inside.\nThis man remembered the shoes being bought a week previous to the murder. A man and two ladies entered his shop, and one of the two ladies asked to see some shoes. She and her companions conversed with each other in a foreign tongue. The lady was very hard to please, and tried on many pairs of shoes before deciding. She was so long about the business that the patience of her companions became exhausted, and they went away, nor did they return. The lady remained in the shop nearly twenty minutes after they had gone. She paid for her purchase with a brand-new five-pound Bank of England note. As soon as this note came into his possession the tradesman, as was his wont in such cases, entered the number of it in a book kept for the purpose.\nSuch luggage as the fugitives had with them, they could possibly carry. They must have gone off at an early hour, before anyone was about except the servants, who at that time would be occupied in the kitchen and the breakfast-room.\nIn constructing his theory Tatlock decided that the probabilities were strongly in favour of the criminals having made their way at once to one of the railway stations from which trains started in the morning for the Continent. Now, there were no fewer than seven stations from which a morning 'boat train' left. The question was—Which one of those seven did they go to? The distance from the scene of the crime to the nearest station was relatively considerable, having regard to the fact that the Luchessis were carrying a bundle of rugs and wraps, a couple of hand-bags, and some odds and ends. Probably, therefore, they would go to the nearest cab-stand or hire a passing vehicle. Tatlock also decided in favour of Luchessi being the right name of the people, and for this reason. Assuming that the murdered woman had been deliberately and by preconcerted plan brought to England to be killed, if she had been asked to go under an assumed name her suspicions would have been aroused. There was also the likelihood of the younger woman really being the sister of the man, though, of course, there was something to be said against that theory.\nMr. and Mrs. Ravel testified that the victim always wore a profusion of jewellery. She had numerous rings on her fingers, rings in her ears, a costly gold watch and chain, brooches, and a string of valuable pearls which she used to wear in her hair when she went to a theatre. The landlady had been struck with the beauty of these pearls. But pearls, rings, brooches, everything had gone. Absolutely nothing was left in the victim's pockets. A wedding-ring was on her finger—it fitted too tightly to be removed. The one thing that Tatlock felt a difficulty in deciding was the motive of the crime, but a careful study of all the aspects of the affair left him no alternative but to decide that plunder was at the bottom of it.\nFour days had passed, but never a trace of the fugitives had been obtained, and yet not for a long time had such a hue-and-cry been raised. Every paper, even the ultra-respectable ones which affected a pious horror of the sensational, made good copy out of the minutest detail they could lay hold of. And where nothing authentic could be obtained the wildest rumours were published. The public were morbidly eager for information, while the proprietors of the papers were eager for the public's pennies, and so the 'Tragedy in Blank Street' was served up every day ad nauseam.\nThe five-pound note which had been paid to the Bond Street shoemaker was the first thing to which Tatlock directed his attention. Inquiry at the Bank of England revealed the fact that the note was one of a number paid to the London branch of a French bank, having its head-quarters in Paris. Inquiry at this branch resulted in very important information. The day before the murder a lady entered the bank and presented three letters of credit, aggregating two thousand seven hundred and eighty-four pounds. The letters had been issued by a Milan bank in favour of one Signora Valetta Luchessi. The lady was alone, and, of course, she was asked if she was the Valetta Luchessi alluded to. She stated she was, and furnished satisfactory proofs of her identity. With the exception of ten five-pound notes, the whole of the money was, by her own request, paid to her in gold. She had brought with her a large wash-leather bag to receive it. As the bag was heavy, she requested the bank porter to carry it for her to a cab, which was waiting. The man did this, and he noted that seated in the cab were a lady and gentleman. As he opened the door and placed the bag on the seat, the gentleman said something to Mrs. Luchessi in a foreign language which the porter did not understand.\nTatlock had not much difficulty in finding the driver of this cab—a four-wheeler. But all the man could tell was that on the day in question he was waiting with his cab on the Bloomsbury stand, when a gentleman, accompanied by two ladies, hired him, and he drove them to the bank, and thence to the house where the murder was committed.\nThe Milan bank was communicated with by telegraph. But all they knew was that they had issued the letters of credit to Signora Valetta Luchessi, who had paid the money chiefly by Italian notes. They knew nothing of the lady, but she had incidentally mentioned that she was going on a pleasure trip with her husband to England. This induced the clerk who transacted the business for her to venture the remark that the sum of money she was taking with her was an unusually large one for such a journey. Whereupon she exclaimed:\n'Oh, you don't suppose I'm going to spend all that, do you? I'm putting it in letters of credit by my husband's advice for safety. He says it's just as though I deposited the amount with a banker.'\nThe clerk was much struck by this remark, and thought the woman very simple. It was in his mind to suggest to her that it would be far wiser and safer to place the greater part of the money to a deposit account in her name, and have a cheque-book; but he refrained from giving expression to his thoughts, as, after all, it was no business of his.\n",

Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\nTHE sun of a summer morning streamed through the open window of a London house, and lighted up a sombrely furnished room. It was an unusually large room; the walls were lined with a wooden panelling, and there was a large old-fashioned fireplace, with a carved wooden mantel-piece, on which stood some trumpery ornaments, but over it was suspended a small oval-shaped sixteenth-century mirror. In striking contrast to this some cheap and vulgar coloured prints were hung on the walls. Nor was this the only incongruity, for old and modern furniture were mixed without any regard for taste or art.\nIn a spacious chair, in an attitude of profound thought, sat a man, his left elbow leaning on the arm of the chair, his index finger laid upon his temples. His eyes, scarcely visible, seemed fixed on space.\nThe sunlight streaming in fell upon a ponderous mahogany wardrobe, the door of which stood open. On the floor of the wardrobe was a large blotch as of spilled liquor, of a reddish-brown tint, and in the immediate front of the wardrobe the carpet bore a similar stain, although not so easily detected as that in the wardrobe. And the stain was the stain of blood—of human blood. It had soaked into the carpet and was not yet properly dry, and if the hand had touched that part it would have been reddened. There were two windows in the room. Opposite the one that was not opened stood a quaint four-post bedstead. The bedclothes were turned down. The bed had evidently been occupied recently, and the undersheet was a ghastly sight, for it was stained with a huge patch, irregular and uneven. The stain was also a stain of blood—human blood. The pillows were splashed, and on one could clearly be traced the impress of blood-wetted fingers.\nThe house was one of the large old-fashioned residences which are still to be found in the neighbourhood of the British Museum, and were the town abodes of fashion during the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century. But nowadays they are for the most part occupied by indigent people, who eke out their existence by letting apartments. Not a few of these noble houses have been the scenes of strange comedies of real life, and of grim tragedy, but no grimmer tragedy had surely ever been enacted than that which had produced those bloodstains in the sunlit room.\nYes, a tragedy! A woman, only four days agone, had been foully and cruelly slain as—there was no doubt about it—she lay in bed. And when life had ebbed away, or it might have been before it had gone, her body had been thrust into the wardrobe, where the blood continued to ooze before rigor mortis set in. Her age was guessed at about thirty-five. She was exceedingly well developed, well nourished, good-looking, with a great quantity of very dark, almost jet-black hair. It was a case of murder, and even at that moment when the sun filled the room with a brilliant light the coroner's jury was holding the necessary legal inquiry, and the mortal remains of the victim were lying stark and stiff in the parish mortuary.\nExactly a fortnight before the ghastly discovery of the woman's doubled-up body in the wardrobe, a 'gentleman' of fair speech and manners, and sartorially respectable, called in company with a lady, whom he represented as his wife, to inquire about apartments. The tenants of the house, a Mr. and Mrs. Ravel, took in boarding lodgers. The lady and gentleman were foreigners. They gave their names as Luchessi, which is Italian, but they spoke English well, though with an accent. They wanted two bedrooms and a sitting-room. The reason for two bedrooms was, as the gentleman explained, his sister was to arrive that night or the next morning. They were on a visit of pleasure to the British metropolis, and expected to remain for three or four weeks. The best bedroom in the house—the room in which the tragedy was enacted—was vacant, and a smaller one on the other side of the passage, and a small sitting-room on the first floor. 'Nothing,' said the gentleman, could suit them better.' The only meal they would take in the house, probably, would be breakfast. When asked for a reference or a deposit, the gentleman readily pulled out a well-filled purse, and paid a whole month in advance. Nothing could have been more satisfactory to the landlady, who was only concerned in getting her rent. Lodgers came and went. Hers was the class of house where people did not stay long. To her they were mere passing shadows, in whom she took no interest beyond the amount of rent they stipulated to pay during their temporary sojourn under her roof. The gentleman incidentally, as it seemed, remarked that he and his wife had little luggage with them, as, being merely on a flying visit, they had not burdened themselves with anything beyond what was absolutely essential.\nHaving settled the preliminaries, Mr. and Mrs. Luchessi went away, saying they would return in the evening. Accordingly, about seven o'clock, they drove up in a four-wheeled cab with a third person, a young woman, who was represented as the husband's sister, and whose name was given as 'Miss Bella Luchessi.' They had with them a small portmanteau, a couple of handbags, and a bundle of rugs. Having deposited their things in their respective rooms, they went out almost immediately, and did not return until midnight.\nAs the day went on, the landlady felt very satisfied with her new guests, although she thought they were perhaps a little eccentric and unduly reserved. They never associated with anyone else in the house. They were quiet, apparently shy, and gave no trouble. They seldom rose before midday. Then they partook of breakfast, which invariably consisted of coffee and bread. After that they went out, and generally returned late. So much and little more did the landlady know of her foreign visitors when the household was stunned by the discovery of the crime. At noon on the day of the discovery the Luchessis had not appeared. Nor were there any signs of them at one o'clock. A chambermaid named Alice Worthington thereupon tapped on Mr. and Mrs. Luchessi's door, and, getting no response, she returned in about a quarter of an hour with the same result. Something induced her to turn the handle. The door, to her surprise, was not locked. She peeped into the room. It was empty. The bed was disarranged, and there was some confusion of portions of the furniture. The girl's attention was drawn to the pillows, which seemed stained in a suspicious manner. She turned the upper clothes down, and started back with horror as she saw that the sheet was saturated with blood. Scarcely able to repress a scream, she tore down breathlessly to her mistress and made known what she had seen. Upstairs went Mr. and Mrs. Ravel to verify the statement, followed by the girl. Yes; it was true enough. The sheet was wet with blood, which had soaked through to the mattress. The landlady ran off to Miss Luchessi's room. That was empty too, but there was no blood there. A scream rang through the house. She rushed back to the big bedroom, to find that her servant had fallen to the floor in a fainting fit, while her husband stood almost spellbound. He had, not knowing what he was going to reveal, opened the wardrobe door, and there, doubled up, was the body of Mrs. Luchessi.\n'Murder; my God, murder!' seemed to thrill through the air and fall on the ears of all, and there was an instinctive shrinking back and a general shuddering.\nIt is an ugly word, no matter when and where uttered. But when, as in this case, it is the exclamatory outburst of horror begotten by the sight of the victim and the victim's blood, its ugliness is intensified. Mr. Ravel recovered his presence of mind.\n'Run quickly and get hold of a policeman,' was his order; and the servants, as if only too glad to hurry away from that now accursed room, went pell-mell down the stairs. Then the man picked up Alice Worthington, bore her to a sofa in another room, and bade his wife attend to her, and he himself went down to the street door, where he awaited the arrival of a constable, to whom he quickly imparted the startling news. The two went upstairs, and in a few minutes a doctor, who lived close by, and had been summoned by one of the alarmed servants, followed them. He did not disturb the body, but satisfied himself that life was absolutely extinct. The three retired. Nothing in the room was disturbed. The door was locked, and an intimation of the occurrence conveyed without loss of time to the proper authorities, and in a very short time the telegraph wires were flashing the news of the crime to every seaport, every railway station in London, and every town of importance in the kingdom. From the first it was seen that the murder was one of a somewhat unusual character, and it was deemed probable that the suspected parties, being foreigners, would get out of the country with the least possible delay. Tyler Tatlock was communicated with, and he was urgently requested to try and get on the track of the fugitives.\nThe man referred to at the opening of this narrative as sitting in a thoughtful attitude in the room where the crime had been committed was Tyler Tatlock himself. He was endeavouring to work out a rational theory for the crime. To him it seemed clear that the murder was a deliberate and deeply-planned one. Three foreigners arrived with very little luggage—nothing but what they could conveniently carry about with them. That in itself was a suspicious circumstance when considered in connection with other things. The woman who passed as Bella Luchessi was, as seemed pretty evident, in league with the man, and if she did not actually kill the other woman she was an accessory to the crime. The object in placing the dead body in the wardrobe was not quite clear, except on one hypothesis. When the body was discovered life had been extinct, according to the medical report, about eight or nine hours. It was two o'clock when the discovery was made.\nShe had, therefore, probably been killed about six or even before. Anyway, the criminals had gone off without anyone in the house hearing them.\nThe victim had been stabbed to death as she lay in bed, and possibly while she was asleep. There were indications that the murderer was nervous, and his or her hand unsteady. The woman had been struck in the first instance on the right side, but the knife was turned by the ribs. Another blow had then been aimed full at the bosom, and the weapon had come in contact with the breast bone, the tip of the blade being broken off, and subsequently recovered during the post mortem examination. Notwithstanding that the weapon was now pointless it had been driven with great force into the left breast, and perforated the pericardium. There must have been a tremendous flow of blood from the three wounds, and Tatlock's deduction was that the body had been removed and placed in the wardrobe to prevent the blood soaking through the bed on to the floor, and so through to the ceiling of the room underneath.\nAnother deduction of his was this. The first and second blow was struck by a woman's hand—Bella Luchessi's. The third and fatal blow, in which great force must have been exerted, by the man. The weapon used was one common in Italy, Spain, and Portugal—a fine blade, about six inches long, shutting up in a handle like a clasp-knife. By touching a spring the blade can be made to fly out, and the knife then forms a dagger of a very formidable kind. This knife, very much bloodstained, had been picked up on the floor between the bed and the wall, showing pretty conclusively that the criminals had become confused, and had lost their heads. There was further evidence of this in a scent-bottle which had been capsized on the dressing-table. The glass stopper of the bottle had come out, rolled to the floor, and the contents of the bottle had been spilled. The scent was frangipanni, a perfume much affected by Continental women.\nWhen the crime was committed the man was not dressed. He had drawn on his trousers afterwards, while his mind was confused and his nerves unstrung. Tatlock came to this conclusion from the fact that round about and beneath a cane-bottom chair at the foot of the bed several English coins were picked up. In drawing on his trousers the contents of a pocket had tumbled out, and he must have been so preoccupied that he did not observe that the coins had fallen. Amongst the money were two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, some silver and coppers. Now, unless a man had been suffering from great mental excitement, he would hardly have left this money scattered about the floor. But what was still stronger evidence of the condition of his mind was that with the coins was a small gold plate with three artificial teeth—front teeth—attached. Tatlock regarded that as of great importance as a clue, and he advised the authorities in describing the man to say that it was probable three of his front teeth were missing. Nothing else was left behind by the fugitives, except a hair-brush, found in the room occupied by Bella Luchessi, and an old travelling-rug. Both of these articles were of foreign make, as was the murdered woman's clothing, which was lying on a couch. The corsets, linen, and other articles were of good quality, and all foreign. The corsets bore the name of a Milan maker. The stockings were English, and had been worn for the first time. And a pair of almost new shoes had the name of a Bond Street shoemaker inside.\nThis man remembered the shoes being bought a week previous to the murder. A man and two ladies entered his shop, and one of the two ladies asked to see some shoes. She and her companions conversed with each other in a foreign tongue.

    "final_summary": "\"Tracked by Teeth\" unfolds as a gripping detective narrative centered on a chilling murder in a London boarding house near the British Museum, an area once distinguished by grand eighteenth-century residences, now largely inhabited by modest lodgers. The story opens on a summer morning bathed in sunlight, exposing a somber, incongruous room where old wood panelling and a sixteenth-century mirror clash with vulgar modern prints and mismatched furniture. This setting becomes the scene of a grim discovery that jolts the household and later envelops the city in intrigue.\n\nIn this room, the lifeless body of a woman is found hidden in a wardrobe with visible bloodstains smeared across the carpet, bed linens, and pillows, marking the gravity of the crime. The victim, a woman about thirty-five years old, was murdered just four days prior, likely stabbed to death while asleep in the bed. The cruelty and suddenness of the murder contrast deeply with the otherwise quiet boarding house. The victim's body shows multiple stab wounds inflicted with a broken, ornate blade typical of Southern Europe, suggesting a violent and deliberate attack. The knife, left bloodied on the floor, indicates the killers were nervous and unsteady. \n\nBefore the murder, three visitors, identifying themselves as the Luchessi family—an Italian gentleman, his “wife,” and a young woman claiming to be his sister—had arrived seeking lodging. They rented the largest bedroom, the very room where the tragedy later unfolded, along with a smaller bedroom and a sitting room. They paid a month’s rent upfront and appeared reserved and reclusive, isolating themselves from others in the house. Their luggage was minimal, which at the time seemed unremarkable, but later aroused suspicion given the crime.\n\nOn the morning of the discovery, the absence of the Luchessis was noticed. When the chambermaid, Alice Worthington, found their door unlocked and the bloodstained bed sheets, alarm grew rapidly. The landlady and her husband soon confirmed the presence of blood soaked into the bed and on the pillows. The body’s ghastly concealment inside the wardrobe emerged only when Mr. Ravel opened its door. This shattering moment unleashed panic and calls for help; police and a doctor were summoned, authorities notified, and the news exploded throughout London and beyond, igniting a widespread manhunt.\n\nTyler Tatlock, the detective entrusted with the investigation, is portrayed deep in thought amid the crime scene’s lingering disturbances. Committed to assembling a coherent narrative from scant clues, Tatlock intuits a carefully planned murder executed by the Luchessis, implicating the man and his supposed sister as conspirators. The victim’s body, crammed into the wardrobe after death, likely was an effort to prevent blood from staining floors below. Tatlock deduces a distinct involvement between the two women and the gentleman in successive stabbing blows, the last and fatal attack delivered with brute force by the man. \n\nImportant forensic and circumstantial evidence supports Tatlock’s deductions. The broken blade weapon, the spilled perfume bottle containing continental scent, and the scattered English coins around a chair imply a chaotic but deliberate act interrupted by nervous haste. Among the coins lay a small gold plate fitted with three artificial front teeth, a detail Tatlock highlights for suspect identification, theorizing the man might have missing front teeth. Other belongings like a foreign hairbrush and travel rug confirm the outsiders’ continental origins. Clothes recovered feature Italian corsets labeled from Milan and Bond Street shoes purchased a week earlier with a newly recorded five-pound note, tying the victim’s wardrobe and movements closely to these individuals.\n\nTatlock’s investigation broadens to tracing the ten-pound note used during the footwear purchase. It was linked to a French bank’s London branch, which had recently conducted a large transaction with a Signora Valetta Luchessi bearing letters of credit totaling nearly three thousand pounds. The day before the murder, this woman had withdrawn a significant sum in gold, assisted by a cab—a vehicle also used to bring the Luchessis to the boarding house. Their flight after the crime was presumed to involve an early morning escape to one of several ‘boat train’ departures leading to continental Europe. The limited luggage and hurried departure reinforced suspicions that the foreigners intended to vanish quickly.\n\nFurther testimonial evidence notes the victim was adorned with costly jewellery—rings, a gold watch, brooches, pearls worn in her hair—but all valuables were missing, suggesting robbery as a likely motive alongside murder. Curiously, a wedding-ring that was too tight was left undisturbed on her finger, hinting at the robbers’ limits or haste. Tatlock, while piecing together motives, struggles but leans toward plunder as the primary cause underpinning the crime, dismissing other possibilities due to the calculated nature of the murder and flight.\n\nThe Luchessis’ personalities and behaviors strike the landlady and servants as odd but not overtly alarming. Their reserved demeanor, avoidance of interaction, and efficient but shy conduct conceal the deadly intentions beneath. Such cold and calculated criminality particularly fascinates Tatlock. The purported relationship between the man and the two women is accepted at face value, although he remains alert to the possibility of aliases, deception, or further conspiracies.\n\nAs newspapers nationwide clamor for details, sensationalizing what they dub the \"Tragedy in Blank Street,\" the investigation intensifies. The press’s voracious appetite for twists and rumors adds pressure on Tatlock and the police to solve the case quickly before the fugitives vanish beyond reach. Tatlock’s combination of forensic insight, sharp observation, and the subtle reading of human behavior becomes key to unravelling the web surrounding the murder.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Tracked by Teeth\" is a detective story rooted deeply in forensic detail and logical deduction, painting a stark image of betrayal, cold-blooded murder, and the complexities of tracing foreign fugitives in bustling London. The use of small but telling evidence—blood patterns, broken knife blades, coins, artificial teeth, and financial transactions—builds a vivid tapestry from which the detective attempts to reconstruct the crime and identify the culprits. The narrative underscores themes of deception, disguise, and human greed while illustrating the painstaking intelligence work that underpins effective criminal investigations. Tatlock’s methodical approach not only seeks justice for the murdered woman but also portrays the broader social dynamics of London’s lodger houses and the shadowy lives of transient foreigners in the city’s underbelly.",
