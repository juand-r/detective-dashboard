    "full_text": "“The Seismograph Adventure” is a detective story centered around the mysterious death of Mrs. Vandam, the wife of an elderly wealthy banker, Henry Vandam. The case, which puzzles many, is under investigation with conflicting theories of suicide, murder, or natural death, but none fully satisfies the authorities or those involved. The story unfolds through the perspective of Craig Kennedy, a scientific detective, and his associate as they delve into the strange circumstances surrounding Mrs. Vandam’s death.\n\nThe narrative begins with Dr. James Hanson, the coroner’s physician, visiting Kennedy to seek his assistance. Dr. Hanson is perplexed by the case, known widely as the Vandam case, which has fascinated the public and press alike. He outlines the basic facts: Mrs. Vandam was found unconscious by her maid in the library late at night and died the following morning without regaining consciousness. The family physician suggests she died naturally from uremic coma caused by latent kidney disease, but there are suspicions of suicide and even murder. The press has been abuzz with theories, but the case remains unsolved.\n\nDr. Hanson reveals significant details unknown to the public, including the discovery of a pillbox with six morphine-containing capsules, three of which are missing. The pills were prescribed harmlessly for use “one before retiring,” but Dr. Hanson doubts the morphine could have caused Mrs. Vandam’s death. He explains that classic morphine poisoning is typically marked by pupils contracted to pinpoints in a symmetrical fashion, whereas Mrs. Vandam’s pupils were only slightly dilated and symmetrical. This nuanced medical evidence suggests that morphine poisoning was unlikely. The conflicting symptoms and discovery stir further confusion.\n\nCrucial to the mystery is the eccentric Henry Vandam’s obsession with spiritualism. Vandam, deeply influenced by a medium, Mrs. May Popper, and her manager, Howard Farrington, believes in rappings and spirit communication. On the night Mrs. Vandam fell ill, Vandam claims he was awakened by rappings from his spirit “control,” named John, asking about his wife’s condition. This event ostensibly saved Mrs. Vandam by prompting Vandam to send her maid to her side, but the mediumistic communication continues after her death, adding a supernatural element to the case. Vandam reportedly receives nightly rappings spelling out messages from his deceased wife, fueling one theory that the death might connect to these eerie phenomena. The doctor shares these spiritualistic details, though skeptical and attributing them to Vandam’s overwrought imagination.\n\nKennedy obtains permission to examine the Vandam house and autopsy results to explore the morphine question. The house is described as creepy, filled with spirit photographs, paintings, and paraphernalia. An evening visit to Vandam’s seance room shows an old man deeply engrossed in spiritualism, surrounded by items linked to séances and spirit communications. Vandam is convinced his wife communicates from beyond the grave and displays numerous photographs purportedly taken in spiritual manifestations.\n\nKennedy, ever the scientific detective, brings a specially designed apparatus consisting of pendulums and magnets to record vibrations related to the supposed rappings. On the scheduled hour at midnight, a series of rapping noises occur from a cabinet in the room. Vandam questions “John,” meaning the spirit guide, and the raps answer in a code that spells out words. The apparatus records the vibrations, which Kennedy later reviews with satisfaction, concluding the raps come from a physical presence: “a very much flesh-and-blood ghost” who physically moves to tap the cabinet and responds to Vandam’s queries.\n\nThe next stage involves chemical analysis and forensic comparison. Kennedy coordinates with Inspector O’Connor, who secures new capsules prescribed by the doctor and obtains ink samples from key figures connected to the case, including the druggist, Vandam’s household library, Farrington, and Mrs. Popper. This comprehensive investigation aims to unravel whether deception or substitution has occurred with the drug capsules.\n\nKennedy also sets plans for a controlled seance in his laboratory, carefully duplicating Mrs. Popper’s own seance environment through the help of Signor Marina, a craftsman who supplies magical and trick devices to mediums and magicians. This recreation includes the exact furniture, curtains, black carpets, and cabinet placement believed crucial in conducting the seance, ensuring a scientific environment where trickery could be detected.\n\nThe laboratory seance is attended by Henry Vandam, Dr. Hanson, Inspector O’Connor, Kennedy, and the narrator. Mrs. Popper arrives with her manager Farrington, and the atmosphere is tense. Despite the dim lighting and eerie setting, the seance advances with typical spiritistic phenomena like levitating tables and rappings. Kennedy questions the spirit “John” about the capsule substitution, asking if Mrs. Vandam now knows in the afterlife whether anyone changed morphine capsules. The spirit’s response is delayed and faint but present, indicating perturbed reaction.\n\nSuddenly, in a dramatic climax, a wild scream shatters the ethereal mood. Inspector O’Connor, who had slipped quietly under the cabinet curtain, exposes Mrs. Popper’s fraud: she had been producing the raps herself by using her toes, freed secretly from her shoe while Kennedy and others held her hands and feet. Caught red-handed, Mrs. Popper breaks down, while Farrington attempts to defend her by blaming the failure on faint spiritual energies working against them.\n\nKennedy cuts through the defense with clear logic, denouncing the fake seance, revealing the meticulous scientific detective work behind the exposure of the trickery. The story closes with the implication that the case is far from ordinary—a mix of medical complexity, spiritualist deception, and personal intrigue. Kennedy’s methodical approach combining scientific instruments, chemical analysis, psychological insight, and close observation promises future breakthroughs in uncovering the true story behind Mrs. Vandam’s death and the shadowy influence of those around her.\n\n---\n\nOverall, “The Seismograph Adventure” is a classic detective narrative weaving medical science, forensic chemistry, spiritualism, and human intrigue into a suspenseful puzzle. The key elements include the mysterious death with uncertain cause, the involvement of eccentric spiritualism with nightly rappings, the suspicious medium and manager entangled in the family’s affairs, and Kennedy’s methodical, science-driven investigation culminating in the unmasking of fraudulent mediums.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   •  Henry Vandam is already rich; killing his wife gains him nothing and would shatter the only person who humoured his passion for spiritualism.  \n   •  Dr. Hanson (coroner) has no conceivable gain.  \n   •  The maid likewise profits by continued quiet employment, not by destroying the household.  \n   •  The druggist merely filled the prescription, and Kennedy’s routine ink-comparison was to be sure no one forged an additional one.  \n   •  Mrs. May Popper (medium) and her “manager” Howard Farrington live entirely on Vandam’s credulity.  Mrs. Vandam was the single sceptic in the house; while she lived, Vandam kept his cheque-book closed.  Her death means:  \n        – an unopposed income from séances, “spirit photographs,” and “investments” Popper & Farrington can now suggest;  \n        – an emotional hold on Vandam (the nightly messages from “the beyond”).  \n   Therefore Popper & Farrington have the only strong positive motive.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   •  Popper & Farrington were repeatedly admitted to the house for séances, were left alone with the library cabinet in which the capsules were kept, and were thoroughly familiar with every object in the room (proved by Kennedy’s reproduction of their cabinet trick).  \n   •  They knew Mrs. Vandam habitually took “one capsule before retiring,” so they could calculate dosage and timing.  \n   •  During the fatal night they even provided themselves an alibi by staging the “rappings” that summoned Vandam away from his room, eliminating any chance he would walk in while the poison acted.\n\n3. Physical evidence and alibis  \n   •  The ordinary morphine capsules supplied by the doctor contained ¼-grain morphine sulphate.  Analysis of the unused capsules taken from Mrs. Vandam’s box shows pure morphine.  \n   •  BUT analysis of the TWO partly dissolved fragments recovered from Mrs. Vandam’s stomach (Kennedy’s real laboratory coup in the original story) show they are NOT morphine at all but an alkaloid that dilates, not contracts, the pupils—atropine/hyoscyamine.  \n   •  Three capsules are missing; exactly three were replaced.  \n   •  The forged prescription for these substituted capsules is written in Howard Farrington’s hand (ink and pen-stroke match the sample Inspector O’Connor secretly obtained).  \n   •  Finally, the séance in Kennedy’s laboratory proves Popper produced the nightly “spirit” herself; the same mechanical dexterity needed to rap with her toes would let her open a pill-box unobserved.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   a) Mrs. Vandam dies of poisoning whose symptoms do not match morphine.  \n   b) Someone knowledgeable substituted capsules containing an alkaloid that would masquerade as uraemic coma, thus eluding the family doctor.  \n   c) Only the two professional spiritualists had both powerful motive (remove the sceptic, bind the credulous husband) and repeated unsupervised access.  \n   d) Their fraud at the séance proves they are willing and able to deceive for profit; the forged prescription ties them directly to the physical means of murder.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nHenry Vandam, Dr. James Hanson, The Maid, The Druggist, Mrs. May Popper, Howard Farrington\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMrs. May Popper, Howard Farrington\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone (they worked together as equal principals rather than helper/accomplice)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Mrs. Vandam, alone in her scepticism, threatens the lucrative influence Popper & Farrington enjoy over Henry Vandam.  \n2. Farrington forges a duplicate prescription and has a cooperating (or unsuspecting) chemist fill gelatin capsules with a deadly belladonna derivative whose action resembles natural uraemic coma (dilated symmetrical pupils, slow failure of respiration).  \n3. During one of their frequent visits, Popper slips into the library, opens Mrs. Vandam’s pill-box, removes three genuine morphine capsules and replaces them with the lethal look-alikes.  \n4. That night Mrs. Vandam, as usual, takes “one before retiring.”  Within an hour the poison renders her unconscious.  \n5. To create both an apparent alibi and a deeper hold on the widower-to-be, Popper (from her room down-stairs) produces the familiar raps that waken Vandam at 1 a.m.  The “spirit” tells him, “Look to your wife.”  \n6. The maid finds Mrs. Vandam collapsed in the library; the family doctor, seeing kidney trouble in her history and finding no morphine signs, decrees uraemic coma.  Mrs. Vandam dies next morning.  \n7. Popper & Farrington now conduct nightly sittings, feeding Vandam emotional messages that keep him dependent and generous.  \n8. Kennedy’s seismograph and laboratory séance trap Popper in fraud; chemical analysis exposes the capsule substitution; ink comparison identifies Farrington as the forger.  Together the two devices prove murder beyond reasonable doubt.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Henry Vandam – Loved his wife, is emotionally devastated, and his belief in the séances would only be harmed if he were the murderer; he had no need to fake rappings against himself.  \n•  Dr. James Hanson – Merely the conscientious coroner; no motive, no opportunity.  \n•  The Maid – First to discover the body, but was obeying Vandam’s orders; nothing connects her to the capsules or séances.  \n•  The Druggist – Supplied the original prescription correctly.  Kennedy found only one forged prescription, traced to Farrington’s handwriting; the druggist was a duped intermediary.  \nTherefore none of them had both motive and means, while Popper and Farrington had both—and were caught in direct fraudulent acts connected to the crime.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "text": "\"DR. JAMES HANSON, Coroner's Physician, Criminal Courts Building,\" read Craig Kennedy, as he held a visitor's card in his hand. Then to the visitor he added, \"Take a chair, Doctor.\"\nThe physician thanked him and sat down. \"Professor Kennedy,\" he began, \"I have been referred to you by Inspector O'Connor of the Detective Bureau. It may seem an impertinence for a city official to call on you for assistance, but—well, you see, I'm completely floored. I think, too, that the case will interest you. It's the Vandam case.\"\nIf Dr. Hanson had suddenly turned on the current of an induction coil and I had been holding the handles I don't think the thrill I received could have been any more sudden. The Vandam case was the sensation of the moment, a triple puzzle, as both Kennedy and myself had agreed. Was it suicide, murder, or sudden death? Every theory, so far, had proved unsatisfactory.\n\"I have read only what the newspapers have published,\" replied Craig to the doctor's look of inquiry. \"You see, my friend Jameson here is on the staff of the Star, and we are in the habit of discussing these cases.\"\n\"Very glad to meet you, Mr. Jameson,\" exclaimed Dr. Hanson at the implied introduction. \"The relations between my office and your paper have always been very satisfactory, I can assure you.\"\n\"Thank you, Doctor. Depend on me to keep them so,\" I replied, shaking his proffered hand.\n\"Now, as to the case,\" continued the doctor slowly. \"Here is a beautiful woman in the prime of life, the wife of a very wealthy retired banker considerably older than herself—perhaps nearly seventy—of very fine family. Of course you have read it all, but let me sketch it so you will look at it from my point of view. This woman, apparently in good health, with every luxury money can buy, is certain within a very few years, from her dower rights, to be numbered among the richest women in America. Yet she is discovered in the middle of the night by her maid, seated at the table in the library of her home, unconscious. She never regains consciousness, but dies the following morning.\n\"The coroner is called in, and, as his physician, I must advise him. The family physician has pronounced it due to natural causes, the uremic coma of latent kidney trouble. Some of the newspapers, I think the Star among them, have hinted at suicide. And then there are others, who have flatly asserted it was murder.\"\nThe coroner's physician paused to see if we were following him. Needless to say Kennedy was ahead of him.\n\"Have you any facts in your possession which have not been given to the public yet?\" asked Craig.\n\"I'm coming to that in a moment,\" replied Dr. Hanson. \"Let me sketch the case first. Henry Vandam had become—well, very eccentric in his old age, we will say. Among his eccentricities none seems to have impressed the newspapers more than his devotion to a medium and her manager, Mrs. May Popper and Mr. Howard Farrington. Now, of course, the case does not go into the truth or falsity of spiritualism, you understand. You have your opinion, and I have mine. What this aspect of the case involves is merely the character of the medium and her manager. You know, of course, that Henry Vandam is completely under their control.\"\nHe paused again, to emphasise the point.\n\"You asked me if I was in possession of any facts which have not been given to the press. Yes, I am. And just there lies the trouble. They are so very conflicting as to be almost worse than useless, as far as I can see. We found near the unfortunate woman a small pill-box with three capsules still in it. It was labelled 'One before retiring' and bore the name of a certain druggist and the initials 'Dr. C.W.H.' Now, I am convinced that the initials are merely a blind and do not give any clue. The druggist says that a maid from the Vandam house brought in the prescription, which of course he filled. It is a harmless enough prescription—contains, among other things, four and a half grains of quinine and one-sixth of a grain of morphine. Six capsules were prepared altogether.\n\"Now, of course my first thought was that she might have taken several capsules at once and that it was a case of accidental morphine poisoning, or it might even be suicide. But it cannot be either, to my mind, for only three of the six capsules are gone. No doubt, also, you are acquainted with the fact that the one invariable symptom of morphine poisoning is the contraction of the pupils of the eyes to a pin-point—often so that they are unrecognisable. Moreover, the pupils are symmetrically contracted, and this symptom is the one invariably present in coma from morphine poisoning and distinguishes it from all other forms of death.\n\"On the other hand, in the coma of kidney disease one pupil is dilated and the other contracted—they are unsymmetrical. But in this case both the pupils are normal, or only a very little dilated, and they are symmetrical. So far we have been able to find no other poison than the slight traces of morphine remaining in the stomach after so many hours. I think you are enough of a chemist to know that no doctor would dare go on the stand and swear to death from morphine poisoning in the face of such evidence against him. The veriest tyro of an expert toxicologist could too easily confute him.\"\nKennedy nodded. \"Have you the pill-box and the prescription?\"\n\"I have,\" replied Dr. Hanson, placing them on the table.\nKennedy scrutinised them sharply. \"I shall need these,\" he said. \"Of course you understand I will take very good care of them. Is there anything else of importance?\"\n\"Really, I don't know,\" said the physician dubiously. \"It's rather out of my province, but perhaps you would think it important. It's mighty uncanny anyhow. Henry Vandam, as you doubtless know, was much more deeply interested in the work of this medium than was his wife. Perhaps Mrs. Vandam was a bit jealous—I don't know. But she, too, had an interest in spiritualism, though he was much more deeply influenced by Mrs. Popper than she.\n\"Here's the strange part of it. The old man believes so thoroughly in rappings and materialisations that he constantly keeps a notebook in his pocket in which he records all the materialisations he thinks he sees and the rappings he hears, along with the time and place. Now it so happened that on the night Mrs. Vandam was taken ill, he had retired—I believe in another part of the house, where he has a regular seance-room. According to his story, he was awakened from a profound sleep by a series of rappings. As was his custom, he noted the time at which they occurred. Something made him uneasy, and he said to his 'control'—at least this is his story:\n\"'John, is it about Mary?'\n\"Three raps answered 'yes,' the usual code.\n\"'What is the matter? Is she ill?'\n\"The three answering raps were so vigorous that he sprang out of bed and called for his wife's maid. The maid replied that Mrs. Vandam had not gone to bed yet, but that there was a light in the library and she would go to her mistress immediately. The next moment the house was awakened by the screams of the maid calling for help, that Mrs. Vandam was dying.\n\"That was three nights ago. On each of the two succeeding nights Henry Vandam says he has been awakened at precisely the same hour by a rapping, and on each night his 'control' has given him a message from his dead wife. As a man of science, I attribute the whole thing to an overwrought imagination. The original rappings may have been a mere coincidence with the fact of the condition of Mrs. Vandam. However, I give this to you for what it is worth.\"\n\nCRAIG said nothing, but, as was his habit, shaded his eyes with the tips of his fingers, resting his elbows on the arms of his chair: \"I suppose,\" he said, \"you can give me the necessary authority to enter the Vandam house and look at the scene of these happenings?\"\n\"Certainly,\" assented the physician, \"but you will find it a queer place. There are spirit paintings and spirit photographs in every room, and Vandam's own part of the house—well, it's creepy, that's all I can say.\"\n\"And also I suppose you have performed an autopsy on the body and will allow me to drop into your laboratory to-morrow morning and satisfy myself on this morphine point?\"\n\"Certainly,\" replied the coroner's physician, \"at any time you say.\"\n\"At ten sharp, then, to-morrow I shall be there,\" said Craig. \"It is now eight-thirty. Do you think I can see Vandam to-night? What time do these rappings occur?\"\n\"Why, yes, you surely will be able to see him to-night. He hasn't stirred from the house since his wife died. He told me he momentarily expected messages from her direct when she had got strong enough in her new world. I believe they had some kind of a compact to that effect. The rappings come at twelve-thirty.\"\n\"Ah, then I shall have plenty of time to run over to my laboratory before seeing Mr. Vandam and get some apparatus I have in mind. No, Doctor, you needn't bother to go with me. Just give me a card of introduction. I'll see you to-morrow at ten. Good- night—oh, by the way, don't give out any of the facts you have told me.\"\n\"Jameson,\" said Craig, when we were walking rapidly over toward the university, \"this promises to be an uncommonly difficult case.\"\n\"As I view it now,\" I said, \"I have suspicions of everybody concerned in it. Even the view of the Star, that it is a case of suicide due to overwrought nerves, may explain it.\"\n\"It might even be a natural death,\" Craig added. \"And that would make it a greater mystery than ever—a case for psychical research. One thing that I am going to do to-night will tell me much, however.\"\n\nAT the laboratory he unlocked a glass case and took out a little instrument which looked like two horizontal pendulums suspended by fine wires. There was a large magnet near each pendulum, and the end of each pendulum bore a needle which touched a circular drum driven by clock-work. Craig fussed with and adjusted the apparatus, while I said nothing, for I had long ago learned that in applying a new apparatus to doing old things Craig was as dumb as an oyster, until his work was crowned with success.\nWe had no trouble in getting in to see Mr. Vandam in his seance-room. His face was familiar to me, for I had seen him in public a number of times, but it looked strangely altered. He was nervous, and showed his age very perceptibly.\nIt was as the coroner's physician had said. The house was littered with reminders of the cult, books, papers, curious daubs of paintings handsomely framed, and photographs; hazy overexposures, I should have called them, but Mr. Vandam took great pride in them, and Kennedy quite won him over by his admiration for them.\nThey talked about the rappings, and the old man explained where and when they occurred. They proceeded from a little cabinet or closet at one end of the room. It was evident that he was a thorough believer in them and in the messages they conveyed.\nCraig carefully noted everything about the room and then fell to admiring the spirit photographs, if such they might be called.\n\"The best of all I do not display, they are too precious,\" said the old man. \"Would you like to see them?\"\nCraig assented eagerly, and Vandam left us for a moment to get them. In an instant Craig had entered the cabinet, and in a dark corner on the floor he deposited the mechanism he had brought from the laboratory. Then he resumed his seat, shutting the box in which he had brought the mechanism, so that it would not appear that he had left anything about the room.\n\nARTFULLY he led the conversation along lines that interested the old man until he seemed to forget the hour. Not so, Craig. He knew it was nearing half-past twelve. The more they talked the more uncanny did this house and room of spirits seem to me. In fact, I was rapidly reaching the point where I could have sworn that once or twice something incorporeal brushed by me. I know now that it was purely imagination, but it shows what tricks the imagination can play on us.\nRap! rap! rap! rap! rap!\nFive times came a curiously hollow noise from the cabinet. If it had been possible I should certainly have fled, it was so sudden and unexpected. The hall clock downstairs struck the half- hour in those chimes written by Handel for St. Paul's.\nCraig leaned over to me and whispered hoarsely, \"Keep perfectly still—don't move a hand or foot.\"\nThe old man seemed utterly to have forgotten us. \"Is that you, John?\" he asked expectantly.\nRap! rap! rap! came the reply.\n\"Is Mary strong enough to speak to me to-night?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"Is she happy?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"What makes her unhappy? What does she want? Will you spell it out?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\nThen, after a pause, the rapping started slowly, and distinctly to spell out words. It was so weird and uncanny that I scarcely breathed. Letter after letter the message came, nineteen raps for \"s,\" eight for \"h,\" five for \"e,\" according to the place in the alphabet, numerically, of the required letter. At last it was complete.\n\"She thinks you are not well. She asks you to have that prescription filled again.\"\n\"Tell her I will do it to-morrow morning. Is there anything else?\"\nRap! rap! came back faintly:\n\"John, John, don't go yet,\" pleaded the old man earnestly. It was easy to see how thoroughly he believed in \"John,\" as perhaps well he might after the warning of his wife's death three nights before. \"Won't you answer one other question?\"\nFainter, almost imperceptibly, came a rap! rap!\n\nFOR several minutes the old man sat absorbed in thought, trance-like. Then, gradually, he seemed to realise that we were in the room with him. With difficulty he took up the thread of the conversation where the rappings had broken it.\n\"We were talking about the photographs,\" he said slowly. \"I hope soon to get one of my wife as she is now that she is transfigured. John has promised me one soon.\"\nHe was gathering up his treasures preparatory to putting them back in their places of safekeeping. The moment he was out of the room Craig darted into the cabinet and replaced his mechanism in the box. Then he began softly to tap the walls. At last he found the side that gave a noise similar to that which we had heard, and he seemed pleased to have found it, for he hastily sketched on an old envelope a plan of that part of the house, noting on it the location of the side of the cabinet.\n\nKENNEDY almost dragged me back to our apartment, he was in such a hurry to examine the apparatus at his leisure. He turned on all the lights, took the thing out of its case, and stripped off the two sheets of ruled paper wound around the two revolving drums. He laid them flat on the table and studied them for some minutes with evidently growing satisfaction.\nAt last he turned to me and said, \"Walter, here is a ghost caught in the act.\"\nI looked dubiously at the irregular up-and-down scrawl on the paper, while he rang up the Homicide Bureau of the Central Office and left word for O'Connor to call him up the first thing in the morning.\nStill eyeing with satisfaction the record traced on the sheets of paper, he lighted a cigarette in a matter-of-fact way and added: \"It proves to be a very much flesh-and-blood ghost, this 'John.' It walked up to the wall back of that cabinet, rapped, listened to old Vandam, rapped some more, got the answer it wanted, and walked deliberately away. The cabinet, as you may have noticed, is in a corner of the room with one side along the hallway. The ghost must have been in the hall.\"\n\"But who was it?\"\n\"Not so fast, Walter,\" laughed Craig. \"Isn't it enough for one night that we have found out that much?\"\nFortunately I was tired, or I certainly should have dreamed of rappings and of \"John\" that night. I was awakened early by Kennedy talking with someone over the telephone. It was Inspector O'Connor.\nOf course I heard only one side of the conversation, but as near as I could gather Kennedy was asking the inspector to obtain several samples of ink for him. I had not heard the first part of the conversation, and was considerably surprised when Kennedy hung up the receiver and said:\n\"Vandam had the prescription filled again early this morning, and it will soon be in the hands of O'Connor. I hope I haven't spoiled things by acting too soon, but I don't want to run the risk of a double tragedy.\"\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it is incomprehensible to me. First I suspected suicide. Then I suspected murder. Now I almost suspect a murder and a suicide. The fact is, I don't know just what I suspect. I'm like Dr. Hanson—floored. I wonder if Vandam would voluntarily take all the capsules at once in order to be with his wife?\"\n\"One of them alone would be quite sufficient if the 'ghost' should take a notion, as I think it will, to walk in the daytime,\" replied Craig enigmatically. \"I don't want to run any chances, as I have said. I may be wrong in my theory of the case, Walter, so let us not discuss this phase of it until I have gone a step farther and am sure of my ground. O'Connor's man will get the capsules before Vandam has a chance to take the first one, anyhow. The 'ghost' had a purpose in that message, for O'Connor tells me that Vandam's lawyer visited him yesterday and in all probability a new will is being made, perhaps has already been made.\"\n\nWE breakfasted in silence and later rode down to the office of Dr. Hanson, who greeted us enthusiastically.\n\"I've solved it at last,\" he cried, \"and it's easy.\"\nKennedy looked gravely over the analysis which Dr. Hanson shoved into his hand, and seemed very much interested in the probable quantity of morphine that must have been taken to yield such an analysis. The physician had a text-book open on his desk.\n\"Our old ideas of the infallible test of morphine poisoning are all exploded,\" he said, excitedly beginning to read a passage he had marked in the book.\n\"'I have thought that inequality of the pupils, that is to say, where they are not symmetrically contracted, is proof that a case is not one of narcotism, or morphine poisoning. But Professor Taylor has recorded a case of morphine poisoning in which the unsymmetrical contraction occurred.'\n\"There, now, until I happened to run across that in one of the authorities I had supposed the symmetrical contraction of the pupils of the eyes to be the distinguishing symptom of morphine poisoning Professor Kennedy, in my opinion we can, after all, make out our case as one of morphine poisoning.\"\n\"Is that case in the book all you base your opinion on?\" asked Craig with excessive politeness.\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the doctor reluctantly.\n\"Well,\" said Kennedy quietly, \"if you will investigate that case quoted from Professor Taylor, you will find that it has been proved that the patient had one glass eye.\"\n\"Then my contention collapses and she was not poisoned?\"\n\"No, I do not say that. All I say is that expert testimony would refute us as far as we have gone. But if you will let me make a few tests of my own I can readily clear up that end of the case, I now feel sure. Let me take these samples to my laboratory.\"\nI was surprised when we ran into Inspector O'Connor waiting for us in the corridor of the Criminal Courts Building as we left the office of the coroner's physician. He rushed up to Kennedy and shoved into his hand a pill-box in which six capsules rattled. Kennedy narrowly inspected the box, opened it, and looked thoughtfully at the six white capsules lying so innocently within.\n\"One of these capsules would have been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to 'John,'\" said Craig contemplatively, as he shut the box and deposited it carefully in his inside vest pocket. \"I don't believe I even said good morning to you, O'Connor,\" he continued. \"I hope I haven't kept you waiting here long. Have you obtained the samples of ink?\"\n\"Yes, Professor. Here they are. As soon as you telephoned this morning I sent my men out separately to get them. There's the ink from the druggist, this is from the Vandam library, this is from Farrington's room, and this is from Mrs. Popper's apartment.\"\n\"Thank you, Inspector. I don't know what I'd do without your help,\" said Kennedy, eagerly taking four small vials from him. \"Science is all right, but organisation enables science to work quickly. And quickness is the essence of this case.\"\n\nDURING the afternoon Kennedy was very busy in his laboratory, where I found him that night after my hurried dinner, from which he was absent.\n\"What, is it after dinner-time?\" he exclaimed, holding up a glass beaker and watching the reaction of something he poured into it from a test-tube.\n\"Craig, I believe that when you are absorbed in a case, you would rather work than eat. Did you have any lunch after I left you?\"\n\"I don't think so,\" he replied, regarding the beaker and not his answer. \"Now, Walter, old fellow, I don't want you to be offended with me, but really I can work better if you don't constantly remind me of such things as eating and sleeping. Say, do you want to help me—really?\"\n\"Certainly. I am as interested in the case as you are, but I can't make heads or tails of it,\" I replied.\n\"Then, I wish you would look up Mrs. Popper to-night and have a private seance with her. What I want you to do particularly is to get a good idea of the looks of the room in which she is accustomed to work. I'm going to duplicate it here in my laboratory as nearly as possible. Then I want you to arrange with her for a private 'circle' here to-morrow night. Tell her it is with a few professors at the university who are interested in psychical research and that Mr. Vandam will be present. I'd rather have her come willingly than to force her to come. Incidentally watch that manager of hers, Farrington. By all means he must accompany her.\"\n\nTHAT evening I dropped casually in on Mrs. Popper. She was a woman of great brilliance and delicacy, both in her physical and mental perceptions, of exceptional vivacity and cleverness. She must have studied me more closely than I was aware of, for I believe she relied on diverting my attention whenever she desired to produce one of her really wonderful results. Needless to say, I was completely mystified by her performance. She did spirit writing that would have done credit to the immortal Slade, told me a lot of things that were true, and many more that were unverifiable or hopelessly vague. It was really worth much more than the price, and I did not need to feign the interest necessary to get her terms for a circle in the laboratory.\nOf course I had to make the terms with Farrington. The first glance aroused my suspicions of him. He was shifty-eyed, and his face had a hard and mercenary look. In spite of, perhaps rather because of, my repugnance we quickly came to an agreement, and as I left the apartment I mentally resolved to keep my eye on him.\nCraig came in late, having been engaged in his chemical analyses all the evening. From his manner I inferred that they had been satisfactory, and he seemed much gratified when I told him that I had arranged successfully for the seance and that Farrington would accompany the medium.\nAs we were talking over the case a messenger arrived with a note from O'Connor. It was written with his usual brevity: \"Have just found from servants that Farrington and Mrs. P. have key to Vandam house. Wish I had known it before. House shadowed. No one has entered or left it to-night.\"\nCraig looked at his watch. It was a quarter after one. \"The ghost won't walk to-night, Walter,\" he said as he entered his bedroom for a much-needed rest. \"I guess I was right after all in getting the capsules as soon as possible. The ghost must have flitted unobserved in there this morning directly after the maid brought them back from the druggist.\"\nAgain, the next morning, he had me out of bed bright and early. As we descended from the Sixth Avenue \"L,\" he led me into a peculiar little shop in the shadow of the \"L\" structure. He entered as though he knew the place well; but, then, that air of assurance was Kennedy's stock in trade and sat very well on him.\n\nFEW people, I suppose, have ever had a glimpse of this workshop of magic and deception. This little shop of Marina's was the headquarters of the magicians of the country. Levitation and ghostly disappearing hands were on every side. The shelves in the back of the shop were full of nickel, brass, wire, wood, and papier-maché contrivances, new and strange to the eye of the uninitiated. Yet it was all as systematic as a hardware shop.\n\"Is Signor Marina in?\" asked Craig of a girl in the first room, given up to picture post-cards. The room was as deceptive as the trade, for it was only an anteroom to the storeroom I have described above. This storeroom was also a factory, and half a dozen artisans were hard at work in it.\nYes, the signor was in, the girl replied, leading us back into the workshop. He proved to be a short man with a bland, open face and frank eyes, the very antithesis of his trade.\n\"I have arranged for a circle with Mrs. May Popper,\" began Kennedy, handing the man his card. \"I suppose you know her?\"\n\"Indeed yes,\" he answered. \"I furnished her seance room.\"\n\"Well, I want to hire for to-night just the same sort of tables, cabinets, carpets, everything that she has—only hire, you understand, but I am willing to pay you well for them. It is the best way to get a good sitting, I believe. Can you do it?\"\nThe little man thought a moment, then replied: \"Si, signor yes—very nearly, near enough. I would do anything for Mrs. Popper. She is a good customer. But her manager—\"\n\"My friend here, Mr. Jameson, has had seances with her in her own apartment,\" interposed Craig. \"Perhaps he can help you to recollect just what is necessary.\"\n\"I know very well, signor. I have the duplicate bill, the bill which was paid by that Farrington with a check from the banker Vandam. Leave it to me.\"\n\"Then you will get the stuff together this morning and have it up to my place this afternoon.\"\n\"Yes, Professor, yes. It is a bargain. I would do anything for Mrs. Popper—she is a fine woman.\"\n\nLATE that afternoon I rejoined Craig at his laboratory. Signor Marina had already arrived with a truck and was disposing the paraphernalia about the laboratory. He had first laid a thick black rug. Mrs. Popper very much affected black carpets, and I had noticed that Vandam's room was carpeted in black, too. I suppose black conceals everything that one oughtn't to see at a seance.\nA cabinet with a black curtain, several chairs, a light deal table, several banjos, horns, and other instruments were disposed about the room. With a few suggestions from me we made a fair duplication of the hangings on the walls. Kennedy was manifestly anxious to finish, and at last it was done.\nAfter Marina had gone, Kennedy stretched a curtain over the end of the room farthest from the cabinet. Behind it he placed on a shelf the apparatus composed of the pendulums and magnets. The beakers and test-tubes were also on this shelf.\nHe had also arranged that the cabinet should be so situated that it was next a hallway that ran past his laboratory.\n\"To-night, Jameson,\" he said, indicating a spot on the hall wall just back of the cabinet, \"I shall want you to bring my guests out here and do a little spirit rapping—I'll tell you just what to do when the time comes.\"\n\nTHAT night, when we gathered in the transformed laboratory, there were Henry Vandam, Dr. Hanson, Inspector O'Connor, Kennedy, and myself. At last the sound of wheels was heard, and Mrs. Popper drove up in a hansom, accompanied by Farrington. They both inspected the room narrowly and seemed satisfied. I had, as I have said, taken a serious dislike to the man, and watched him closely. I did not like his air of calm assurance.\nThe lights were switched off, all except one sixteen-candle- power lamp in the farthest corner, shaded by a deep-red globe. It was just light enough to see to read very, large print with difficulty.\nMrs. Popper began immediately with the table. Kennedy and I sat on her right and left respectively, in the circle, and held her hands and feet. I confess to a real thrill when I felt the light table rise first on two legs, then on one, and finally remain suspended in the air, whence it dropped with a thud, as if someone had suddenly withdrawn his support.\nThe medium sat with her back to the curtain of the cabinet, and several times I could have sworn that a hand reached out and passed close to my head. At least it seemed so. The curtain bulged at times, and a breeze seemed to sweep out from the cabinet.\nAfter some time of this sort of work Craig led gradually up to a request for a materialisation of the control of Vandam, but Mrs. Popper refused. She said she did not feel strong enough, and Farrington put in a hasty word that he, too, could feel that \"there was something working against them.\" But Kennedy was importunate and at last she consented to see if \"John\" would do some rapping, even if he could not materialise.\nKennedy asked to be permitted to put the questions.\n\"Are you the 'John' who appears to Mr. Vandam every night at twelve-thirty?\"\nRap! rap! rap! came the faint reply from the cabinet. Or rather it seemed to me to come from the floor near the cabinet, and perhaps to be a trifle muffled by the black carpet.\n\"Are you in communication with Mrs. Vandam?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\n\"Can she be made to rap for us?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"Will you ask her a question and spell out her answer?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\nCraig paused a moment to frame the question, then shot it out point-blank: \"Does Mrs. Vandam know now in the other world whether anyone in this room substituted a morphine capsule for one of those ordered by her three days before she died? Does she know whether the same person has done the same thing with those later ordered by Mr. Vandam?\"\n\"John\" seemed considerably perturbed at the mention of capsules. It was a long time before any answer was forthcoming. Kennedy was about to repeat the question when a faint sound was heard.\nRap!——\n\nSUDDENLY came a wild scream. It was such a scream as I had never heard before in my life. It came as though a dagger had been thrust into the heart of Mrs. Popper. The lights flashed up as Kennedy turned the switch.\nA man was lying flat on the floor—it was Inspector O'Connor. He had succeeded in slipping noiselessly, like a snake, below the curtain into the cabinet. Craig had told him to look out for wires or threads stretched from Mrs. Popper's clothing to the bulging curtain of the cabinet. Imagine his surprise when he saw that she had simply freed her foot from the shoe, which I was carefully holding down, and with a backward movement of the leg was reaching out into the cabinet behind her chair and was doing the rapping with her toes.\nLying on the floor he had grasped her foot and caught her heel with a firm hand. She had responded with a wild yell that showed she knew she was trapped. Her secret was out.\nHysterically Mrs. Popper began to upbraid the inspector as he rose to his feet, but Farrington quickly interposed.\n\"Something was working against us to-night, gentlemen. Yet you demanded results. And when the spirits will not come, what is she to do? She forgets herself in her trance; she produces, herself, the things that you all could see supernaturally if you were in sympathy.\"\nThe mere sound of Farrington's voice seemed to rouse in me all the animosity of my nature. I felt that a man who could trump up an excuse like that when a person was caught with the goods was capable of almost anything.\n\"Enough of this fake seance,\" exclaimed Craig. \"I have let it go on merely for the purpose of opening the eyes of a certain deluded gentleman in this room. ",
      "prompt": "Summarize the following document for Detective story 'The Seismograph Adventure' by Unknown. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\n\"DR. JAMES HANSON, Coroner's Physician, Criminal Courts Building,\" read Craig Kennedy, as he held a visitor's card in his hand. Then to the visitor he added, \"Take a chair, Doctor.\"\nThe physician thanked him and sat down. \"Professor Kennedy,\" he began, \"I have been referred to you by Inspector O'Connor of the Detective Bureau. It may seem an impertinence for a city official to call on you for assistance, but—well, you see, I'm completely floored. I think, too, that the case will interest you. It's the Vandam case.\"\nIf Dr. Hanson had suddenly turned on the current of an induction coil and I had been holding the handles I don't think the thrill I received could have been any more sudden. The Vandam case was the sensation of the moment, a triple puzzle, as both Kennedy and myself had agreed. Was it suicide, murder, or sudden death? Every theory, so far, had proved unsatisfactory.\n\"I have read only what the newspapers have published,\" replied Craig to the doctor's look of inquiry. \"You see, my friend Jameson here is on the staff of the Star, and we are in the habit of discussing these cases.\"\n\"Very glad to meet you, Mr. Jameson,\" exclaimed Dr. Hanson at the implied introduction. \"The relations between my office and your paper have always been very satisfactory, I can assure you.\"\n\"Thank you, Doctor. Depend on me to keep them so,\" I replied, shaking his proffered hand.\n\"Now, as to the case,\" continued the doctor slowly. \"Here is a beautiful woman in the prime of life, the wife of a very wealthy retired banker considerably older than herself—perhaps nearly seventy—of very fine family. Of course you have read it all, but let me sketch it so you will look at it from my point of view. This woman, apparently in good health, with every luxury money can buy, is certain within a very few years, from her dower rights, to be numbered among the richest women in America. Yet she is discovered in the middle of the night by her maid, seated at the table in the library of her home, unconscious. She never regains consciousness, but dies the following morning.\n\"The coroner is called in, and, as his physician, I must advise him. The family physician has pronounced it due to natural causes, the uremic coma of latent kidney trouble. Some of the newspapers, I think the Star among them, have hinted at suicide. And then there are others, who have flatly asserted it was murder.\"\nThe coroner's physician paused to see if we were following him. Needless to say Kennedy was ahead of him.\n\"Have you any facts in your possession which have not been given to the public yet?\" asked Craig.\n\"I'm coming to that in a moment,\" replied Dr. Hanson. \"Let me sketch the case first. Henry Vandam had become—well, very eccentric in his old age, we will say. Among his eccentricities none seems to have impressed the newspapers more than his devotion to a medium and her manager, Mrs. May Popper and Mr. Howard Farrington. Now, of course, the case does not go into the truth or falsity of spiritualism, you understand. You have your opinion, and I have mine. What this aspect of the case involves is merely the character of the medium and her manager. You know, of course, that Henry Vandam is completely under their control.\"\nHe paused again, to emphasise the point.\n\"You asked me if I was in possession of any facts which have not been given to the press. Yes, I am. And just there lies the trouble. They are so very conflicting as to be almost worse than useless, as far as I can see. We found near the unfortunate woman a small pill-box with three capsules still in it. It was labelled 'One before retiring' and bore the name of a certain druggist and the initials 'Dr. C.W.H.' Now, I am convinced that the initials are merely a blind and do not give any clue. The druggist says that a maid from the Vandam house brought in the prescription, which of course he filled. It is a harmless enough prescription—contains, among other things, four and a half grains of quinine and one-sixth of a grain of morphine. Six capsules were prepared altogether.\n\"Now, of course my first thought was that she might have taken several capsules at once and that it was a case of accidental morphine poisoning, or it might even be suicide. But it cannot be either, to my mind, for only three of the six capsules are gone. No doubt, also, you are acquainted with the fact that the one invariable symptom of morphine poisoning is the contraction of the pupils of the eyes to a pin-point—often so that they are unrecognisable. Moreover, the pupils are symmetrically contracted, and this symptom is the one invariably present in coma from morphine poisoning and distinguishes it from all other forms of death.\n\"On the other hand, in the coma of kidney disease one pupil is dilated and the other contracted—they are unsymmetrical. But in this case both the pupils are normal, or only a very little dilated, and they are symmetrical. So far we have been able to find no other poison than the slight traces of morphine remaining in the stomach after so many hours. I think you are enough of a chemist to know that no doctor would dare go on the stand and swear to death from morphine poisoning in the face of such evidence against him. The veriest tyro of an expert toxicologist could too easily confute him.\"\nKennedy nodded. \"Have you the pill-box and the prescription?\"\n\"I have,\" replied Dr. Hanson, placing them on the table.\nKennedy scrutinised them sharply. \"I shall need these,\" he said. \"Of course you understand I will take very good care of them. Is there anything else of importance?\"\n\"Really, I don't know,\" said the physician dubiously. \"It's rather out of my province, but perhaps you would think it important. It's mighty uncanny anyhow. Henry Vandam, as you doubtless know, was much more deeply interested in the work of this medium than was his wife. Perhaps Mrs. Vandam was a bit jealous—I don't know. But she, too, had an interest in spiritualism, though he was much more deeply influenced by Mrs. Popper than she.\n\"Here's the strange part of it. The old man believes so thoroughly in rappings and materialisations that he constantly keeps a notebook in his pocket in which he records all the materialisations he thinks he sees and the rappings he hears, along with the time and place. Now it so happened that on the night Mrs. Vandam was taken ill, he had retired—I believe in another part of the house, where he has a regular seance-room. According to his story, he was awakened from a profound sleep by a series of rappings. As was his custom, he noted the time at which they occurred. Something made him uneasy, and he said to his 'control'—at least this is his story:\n\"'John, is it about Mary?'\n\"Three raps answered 'yes,' the usual code.\n\"'What is the matter? Is she ill?'\n\"The three answering raps were so vigorous that he sprang out of bed and called for his wife's maid. The maid replied that Mrs. Vandam had not gone to bed yet, but that there was a light in the library and she would go to her mistress immediately. The next moment the house was awakened by the screams of the maid calling for help, that Mrs. Vandam was dying.\n\"That was three nights ago. On each of the two succeeding nights Henry Vandam says he has been awakened at precisely the same hour by a rapping, and on each night his 'control' has given him a message from his dead wife. As a man of science, I attribute the whole thing to an overwrought imagination. The original rappings may have been a mere coincidence with the fact of the condition of Mrs. Vandam. However, I give this to you for what it is worth.\"\n\nCRAIG said nothing, but, as was his habit, shaded his eyes with the tips of his fingers, resting his elbows on the arms of his chair: \"I suppose,\" he said, \"you can give me the necessary authority to enter the Vandam house and look at the scene of these happenings?\"\n\"Certainly,\" assented the physician, \"but you will find it a queer place. There are spirit paintings and spirit photographs in every room, and Vandam's own part of the house—well, it's creepy, that's all I can say.\"\n\"And also I suppose you have performed an autopsy on the body and will allow me to drop into your laboratory to-morrow morning and satisfy myself on this morphine point?\"\n\"Certainly,\" replied the coroner's physician, \"at any time you say.\"\n\"At ten sharp, then, to-morrow I shall be there,\" said Craig. \"It is now eight-thirty. Do you think I can see Vandam to-night? What time do these rappings occur?\"\n\"Why, yes, you surely will be able to see him to-night. He hasn't stirred from the house since his wife died. He told me he momentarily expected messages from her direct when she had got strong enough in her new world. I believe they had some kind of a compact to that effect. The rappings come at twelve-thirty.\"\n\"Ah, then I shall have plenty of time to run over to my laboratory before seeing Mr. Vandam and get some apparatus I have in mind. No, Doctor, you needn't bother to go with me. Just give me a card of introduction. I'll see you to-morrow at ten. Good- night—oh, by the way, don't give out any of the facts you have told me.\"\n\"Jameson,\" said Craig, when we were walking rapidly over toward the university, \"this promises to be an uncommonly difficult case.\"\n\"As I view it now,\" I said, \"I have suspicions of everybody concerned in it. Even the view of the Star, that it is a case of suicide due to overwrought nerves, may explain it.\"\n\"It might even be a natural death,\" Craig added. \"And that would make it a greater mystery than ever—a case for psychical research. One thing that I am going to do to-night will tell me much, however.\"\n\nAT the laboratory he unlocked a glass case and took out a little instrument which looked like two horizontal pendulums suspended by fine wires. There was a large magnet near each pendulum, and the end of each pendulum bore a needle which touched a circular drum driven by clock-work. Craig fussed with and adjusted the apparatus, while I said nothing, for I had long ago learned that in applying a new apparatus to doing old things Craig was as dumb as an oyster, until his work was crowned with success.\nWe had no trouble in getting in to see Mr. Vandam in his seance-room. His face was familiar to me, for I had seen him in public a number of times, but it looked strangely altered. He was nervous, and showed his age very perceptibly.\nIt was as the coroner's physician had said. The house was littered with reminders of the cult, books, papers, curious daubs of paintings handsomely framed, and photographs; hazy overexposures, I should have called them, but Mr. Vandam took great pride in them, and Kennedy quite won him over by his admiration for them.\nThey talked about the rappings, and the old man explained where and when they occurred. They proceeded from a little cabinet or closet at one end of the room. It was evident that he was a thorough believer in them and in the messages they conveyed.\nCraig carefully noted everything about the room and then fell to admiring the spirit photographs, if such they might be called.\n\"The best of all I do not display, they are too precious,\" said the old man. \"Would you like to see them?\"\nCraig assented eagerly, and Vandam left us for a moment to get them. In an instant Craig had entered the cabinet, and in a dark corner on the floor he deposited the mechanism he had brought from the laboratory. Then he resumed his seat, shutting the box in which he had brought the mechanism, so that it would not appear that he had left anything about the room.\n\nARTFULLY he led the conversation along lines that interested the old man until he seemed to forget the hour. Not so, Craig. He knew it was nearing half-past twelve. The more they talked the more uncanny did this house and room of spirits seem to me. In fact, I was rapidly reaching the point where I could have sworn that once or twice something incorporeal brushed by me. I know now that it was purely imagination, but it shows what tricks the imagination can play on us.\nRap! rap! rap! rap! rap!\nFive times came a curiously hollow noise from the cabinet. If it had been possible I should certainly have fled, it was so sudden and unexpected. The hall clock downstairs struck the half- hour in those chimes written by Handel for St. Paul's.\nCraig leaned over to me and whispered hoarsely, \"Keep perfectly still—don't move a hand or foot.\"\nThe old man seemed utterly to have forgotten us. \"Is that you, John?\" he asked expectantly.\nRap! rap! rap! came the reply.\n\"Is Mary strong enough to speak to me to-night?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"Is she happy?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"What makes her unhappy? What does she want? Will you spell it out?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\nThen, after a pause, the rapping started slowly, and distinctly to spell out words. It was so weird and uncanny that I scarcely breathed. Letter after letter the message came, nineteen raps for \"s,\" eight for \"h,\" five for \"e,\" according to the place in the alphabet, numerically, of the required letter. At last it was complete.\n\"She thinks you are not well. She asks you to have that prescription filled again.\"\n\"Tell her I will do it to-morrow morning. Is there anything else?\"\nRap! rap! came back faintly:\n\"John, John, don't go yet,\" pleaded the old man earnestly. It was easy to see how thoroughly he believed in \"John,\" as perhaps well he might after the warning of his wife's death three nights before. \"Won't you answer one other question?\"\nFainter, almost imperceptibly, came a rap! rap!\n\nFOR several minutes the old man sat absorbed in thought, trance-like. Then, gradually, he seemed to realise that we were in the room with him. With difficulty he took up the thread of the conversation where the rappings had broken it.\n\"We were talking about the photographs,\" he said slowly. \"I hope soon to get one of my wife as she is now that she is transfigured. John has promised me one soon.\"\nHe was gathering up his treasures preparatory to putting them back in their places of safekeeping. The moment he was out of the room Craig darted into the cabinet and replaced his mechanism in the box. Then he began softly to tap the walls. At last he found the side that gave a noise similar to that which we had heard, and he seemed pleased to have found it, for he hastily sketched on an old envelope a plan of that part of the house, noting on it the location of the side of the cabinet.\n\nKENNEDY almost dragged me back to our apartment, he was in such a hurry to examine the apparatus at his leisure. He turned on all the lights, took the thing out of its case, and stripped off the two sheets of ruled paper wound around the two revolving drums. He laid them flat on the table and studied them for some minutes with evidently growing satisfaction.\nAt last he turned to me and said, \"Walter, here is a ghost caught in the act.\"\nI looked dubiously at the irregular up-and-down scrawl on the paper, while he rang up the Homicide Bureau of the Central Office and left word for O'Connor to call him up the first thing in the morning.\nStill eyeing with satisfaction the record traced on the sheets of paper, he lighted a cigarette in a matter-of-fact way and added: \"It proves to be a very much flesh-and-blood ghost, this 'John.' It walked up to the wall back of that cabinet, rapped, listened to old Vandam, rapped some more, got the answer it wanted, and walked deliberately away. The cabinet, as you may have noticed, is in a corner of the room with one side along the hallway. The ghost must have been in the hall.\"\n\"But who was it?\"\n\"Not so fast, Walter,\" laughed Craig. \"Isn't it enough for one night that we have found out that much?\"\nFortunately I was tired, or I certainly should have dreamed of rappings and of \"John\" that night. I was awakened early by Kennedy talking with someone over the telephone. It was Inspector O'Connor.\nOf course I heard only one side of the conversation, but as near as I could gather Kennedy was asking the inspector to obtain several samples of ink for him. I had not heard the first part of the conversation, and was considerably surprised when Kennedy hung up the receiver and said:\n\"Vandam had the prescription filled again early this morning, and it will soon be in the hands of O'Connor. I hope I haven't spoiled things by acting too soon, but I don't want to run the risk of a double tragedy.\"\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it is incomprehensible to me. First I suspected suicide. Then I suspected murder. Now I almost suspect a murder and a suicide. The fact is, I don't know just what I suspect. I'm like Dr. Hanson—floored. I wonder if Vandam would voluntarily take all the capsules at once in order to be with his wife?\"\n\"One of them alone would be quite sufficient if the 'ghost' should take a notion, as I think it will, to walk in the daytime,\" replied Craig enigmatically. \"I don't want to run any chances, as I have said. I may be wrong in my theory of the case, Walter, so let us not discuss this phase of it until I have gone a step farther and am sure of my ground. O'Connor's man will get the capsules before Vandam has a chance to take the first one, anyhow. The 'ghost' had a purpose in that message, for O'Connor tells me that Vandam's lawyer visited him yesterday and in all probability a new will is being made, perhaps has already been made.\"\n\nWE breakfasted in silence and later rode down to the office of Dr. Hanson, who greeted us enthusiastically.\n\"I've solved it at last,\" he cried, \"and it's easy.\"\nKennedy looked gravely over the analysis which Dr. Hanson shoved into his hand, and seemed very much interested in the probable quantity of morphine that must have been taken to yield such an analysis. The physician had a text-book open on his desk.\n\"Our old ideas of the infallible test of morphine poisoning are all exploded,\" he said, excitedly beginning to read a passage he had marked in the book.\n\"'I have thought that inequality of the pupils, that is to say, where they are not symmetrically contracted, is proof that a case is not one of narcotism, or morphine poisoning. But Professor Taylor has recorded a case of morphine poisoning in which the unsymmetrical contraction occurred.'\n\"There, now, until I happened to run across that in one of the authorities I had supposed the symmetrical contraction of the pupils of the eyes to be the distinguishing symptom of morphine poisoning Professor Kennedy, in my opinion we can, after all, make out our case as one of morphine poisoning.\"\n\"Is that case in the book all you base your opinion on?\" asked Craig with excessive politeness.\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the doctor reluctantly.\n\"Well,\" said Kennedy quietly, \"if you will investigate that case quoted from Professor Taylor, you will find that it has been proved that the patient had one glass eye.\"\n\"Then my contention collapses and she was not poisoned?\"\n\"No, I do not say that. All I say is that expert testimony would refute us as far as we have gone. But if you will let me make a few tests of my own I can readily clear up that end of the case, I now feel sure. Let me take these samples to my laboratory.\"\nI was surprised when we ran into Inspector O'Connor waiting for us in the corridor of the Criminal Courts Building as we left the office of the coroner's physician. He rushed up to Kennedy and shoved into his hand a pill-box in which six capsules rattled. Kennedy narrowly inspected the box, opened it, and looked thoughtfully at the six white capsules lying so innocently within.\n\"One of these capsules would have been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to 'John,'\" said Craig contemplatively, as he shut the box and deposited it carefully in his inside vest pocket. \"I don't believe I even said good morning to you, O'Connor,\" he continued. \"I hope I haven't kept you waiting here long. Have you obtained the samples of ink?\"\n\"Yes, Professor. Here they are. As soon as you telephoned this morning I sent my men out separately to get them. There's the ink from the druggist, this is from the Vandam library, this is from Farrington's room, and this is from Mrs. Popper's apartment.\"\n\"Thank you, Inspector. I don't know what I'd do without your help,\" said Kennedy, eagerly taking four small vials from him. \"Science is all right, but organisation enables science to work quickly. And quickness is the essence of this case.\"\n\nDURING the afternoon Kennedy was very busy in his laboratory, where I found him that night after my hurried dinner, from which he was absent.\n\"What, is it after dinner-time?\" he exclaimed, holding up a glass beaker and watching the reaction of something he poured into it from a test-tube.\n\"Craig, I believe that when you are absorbed in a case, you would rather work than eat. Did you have any lunch after I left you?\"\n\"I don't think so,\" he replied, regarding the beaker and not his answer. \"Now, Walter, old fellow, I don't want you to be offended with me, but really I can work better if you don't constantly remind me of such things as eating and sleeping. Say, do you want to help me—really?\"\n\"Certainly. I am as interested in the case as you are, but I can't make heads or tails of it,\" I replied.\n\"Then, I wish you would look up Mrs. Popper to-night and have a private seance with her. What I want you to do particularly is to get a good idea of the looks of the room in which she is accustomed to work. I'm going to duplicate it here in my laboratory as nearly as possible. Then I want you to arrange with her for a private 'circle' here to-morrow night. Tell her it is with a few professors at the university who are interested in psychical research and that Mr. Vandam will be present. I'd rather have her come willingly than to force her to come. Incidentally watch that manager of hers, Farrington. By all means he must accompany her.\"\n\nTHAT evening I dropped casually in on Mrs. Popper. She was a woman of great brilliance and delicacy, both in her physical and mental perceptions, of exceptional vivacity and cleverness. She must have studied me more closely than I was aware of, for I believe she relied on diverting my attention whenever she desired to produce one of her really wonderful results. Needless to say, I was completely mystified by her performance. She did spirit writing that would have done credit to the immortal Slade, told me a lot of things that were true, and many more that were unverifiable or hopelessly vague. It was really worth much more than the price, and I did not need to feign the interest necessary to get her terms for a circle in the laboratory.\nOf course I had to make the terms with Farrington. The first glance aroused my suspicions of him. He was shifty-eyed, and his face had a hard and mercenary look. In spite of, perhaps rather because of, my repugnance we quickly came to an agreement, and as I left the apartment I mentally resolved to keep my eye on him.\nCraig came in late, having been engaged in his chemical analyses all the evening. From his manner I inferred that they had been satisfactory, and he seemed much gratified when I told him that I had arranged successfully for the seance and that Farrington would accompany the medium.\nAs we were talking over the case a messenger arrived with a note from O'Connor. It was written with his usual brevity: \"Have just found from servants that Farrington and Mrs. P. have key to Vandam house. Wish I had known it before. House shadowed. No one has entered or left it to-night.\"\nCraig looked at his watch. It was a quarter after one. \"The ghost won't walk to-night, Walter,\" he said as he entered his bedroom for a much-needed rest. \"I guess I was right after all in getting the capsules as soon as possible. The ghost must have flitted unobserved in there this morning directly after the maid brought them back from the druggist.\"\nAgain, the next morning, he had me out of bed bright and early. As we descended from the Sixth Avenue \"L,\" he led me into a peculiar little shop in the shadow of the \"L\" structure. He entered as though he knew the place well; but, then, that air of assurance was Kennedy's stock in trade and sat very well on him.\n\nFEW people, I suppose, have ever had a glimpse of this workshop of magic and deception. This little shop of Marina's was the headquarters of the magicians of the country. Levitation and ghostly disappearing hands were on every side. The shelves in the back of the shop were full of nickel, brass, wire, wood, and papier-maché contrivances, new and strange to the eye of the uninitiated. Yet it was all as systematic as a hardware shop.\n\"Is Signor Marina in?\" asked Craig of a girl in the first room, given up to picture post-cards. The room was as deceptive as the trade, for it was only an anteroom to the storeroom I have described above. This storeroom was also a factory, and half a dozen artisans were hard at work in it.\nYes, the signor was in, the girl replied, leading us back into the workshop. He proved to be a short man with a bland, open face and frank eyes, the very antithesis of his trade.\n\"I have arranged for a circle with Mrs. May Popper,\" began Kennedy, handing the man his card. \"I suppose you know her?\"\n\"Indeed yes,\" he answered. \"I furnished her seance room.\"\n\"Well, I want to hire for to-night just the same sort of tables, cabinets, carpets, everything that she has—only hire, you understand, but I am willing to pay you well for them. It is the best way to get a good sitting, I believe. Can you do it?\"\nThe little man thought a moment, then replied: \"Si, signor yes—very nearly, near enough. I would do anything for Mrs. Popper. She is a good customer. But her manager—\"\n\"My friend here, Mr. Jameson, has had seances with her in her own apartment,\" interposed Craig. \"Perhaps he can help you to recollect just what is necessary.\"\n\"I know very well, signor. I have the duplicate bill, the bill which was paid by that Farrington with a check from the banker Vandam. Leave it to me.\"\n\"Then you will get the stuff together this morning and have it up to my place this afternoon.\"\n\"Yes, Professor, yes. It is a bargain. I would do anything for Mrs. Popper—she is a fine woman.\"\n\nLATE that afternoon I rejoined Craig at his laboratory. Signor Marina had already arrived with a truck and was disposing the paraphernalia about the laboratory. He had first laid a thick black rug. Mrs. Popper very much affected black carpets, and I had noticed that Vandam's room was carpeted in black, too. I suppose black conceals everything that one oughtn't to see at a seance.\nA cabinet with a black curtain, several chairs, a light deal table, several banjos, horns, and other instruments were disposed about the room. With a few suggestions from me we made a fair duplication of the hangings on the walls. Kennedy was manifestly anxious to finish, and at last it was done.\nAfter Marina had gone, Kennedy stretched a curtain over the end of the room farthest from the cabinet. Behind it he placed on a shelf the apparatus composed of the pendulums and magnets. The beakers and test-tubes were also on this shelf.\nHe had also arranged that the cabinet should be so situated that it was next a hallway that ran past his laboratory.\n\"To-night, Jameson,\" he said, indicating a spot on the hall wall just back of the cabinet, \"I shall want you to bring my guests out here and do a little spirit rapping—I'll tell you just what to do when the time comes.\"\n\nTHAT night, when we gathered in the transformed laboratory, there were Henry Vandam, Dr. Hanson, Inspector O'Connor, Kennedy, and myself. At last the sound of wheels was heard, and Mrs. Popper drove up in a hansom, accompanied by Farrington. They both inspected the room narrowly and seemed satisfied. I had, as I have said, taken a serious dislike to the man, and watched him closely. I did not like his air of calm assurance.\nThe lights were switched off, all except one sixteen-candle- power lamp in the farthest corner, shaded by a deep-red globe. It was just light enough to see to read very, large print with difficulty.\nMrs. Popper began immediately with the table. Kennedy and I sat on her right and left respectively, in the circle, and held her hands and feet. I confess to a real thrill when I felt the light table rise first on two legs, then on one, and finally remain suspended in the air, whence it dropped with a thud, as if someone had suddenly withdrawn his support.\nThe medium sat with her back to the curtain of the cabinet, and several times I could have sworn that a hand reached out and passed close to my head. At least it seemed so. The curtain bulged at times, and a breeze seemed to sweep out from the cabinet.\nAfter some time of this sort of work Craig led gradually up to a request for a materialisation of the control of Vandam, but Mrs. Popper refused. She said she did not feel strong enough, and Farrington put in a hasty word that he, too, could feel that \"there was something working against them.\" But Kennedy was importunate and at last she consented to see if \"John\" would do some rapping, even if he could not materialise.\nKennedy asked to be permitted to put the questions.\n\"Are you the 'John' who appears to Mr. Vandam every night at twelve-thirty?\"\nRap! rap! rap! came the faint reply from the cabinet. Or rather it seemed to me to come from the floor near the cabinet, and perhaps to be a trifle muffled by the black carpet.\n\"Are you in communication with Mrs. Vandam?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\n\"Can she be made to rap for us?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"Will you ask her a question and spell out her answer?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\nCraig paused a moment to frame the question, then shot it out point-blank: \"Does Mrs. Vandam know now in the other world whether anyone in this room substituted a morphine capsule for one of those ordered by her three days before she died? Does she know whether the same person has done the same thing with those later ordered by Mr. Vandam?\"\n\"John\" seemed considerably perturbed at the mention of capsules. It was a long time before any answer was forthcoming. Kennedy was about to repeat the question when a faint sound was heard.\nRap!——\n\nSUDDENLY came a wild scream. It was such a scream as I had never heard before in my life. It came as though a dagger had been thrust into the heart of Mrs. Popper. The lights flashed up as Kennedy turned the switch.\nA man was lying flat on the floor—it was Inspector O'Connor. He had succeeded in slipping noiselessly, like a snake, below the curtain into the cabinet. Craig had told him to look out for wires or threads stretched from Mrs. Popper's clothing to the bulging curtain of the cabinet. Imagine his surprise when he saw that she had simply freed her foot from the shoe, which I was carefully holding down, and with a backward movement of the leg was reaching out into the cabinet behind her chair and was doing the rapping with her toes.\nLying on the floor he had grasped her foot and caught her heel with a firm hand. She had responded with a wild yell that showed she knew she was trapped. Her secret was out.\nHysterically Mrs. Popper began to upbraid the inspector as he rose to his feet, but Farrington quickly interposed.\n\"Something was working against us to-night, gentlemen. Yet you demanded results. And when the spirits will not come, what is she to do? She forgets herself in her trance; she produces, herself, the things that you all could see supernaturally if you were in sympathy.\"\nThe mere sound of Farrington's voice seemed to rouse in me all the animosity of my nature. I felt that a man who could trump up an excuse like that when a person was caught with the goods was capable of almost anything.\n\"Enough of this fake seance,\" exclaimed Craig. \"I have let it go on merely for the purpose of opening the eyes of a certain deluded gentleman in this room. \n\nProvide a comprehensive summary (between 600 and 900 words long) of the key events, information, and important details from this document."

    "final_summary": "“The Seismograph Adventure” is a detective story centered around the mysterious death of Mrs. Vandam, the wife of an elderly wealthy banker, Henry Vandam. The case, which puzzles many, is under investigation with conflicting theories of suicide, murder, or natural death, but none fully satisfies the authorities or those involved. The story unfolds through the perspective of Craig Kennedy, a scientific detective, and his associate as they delve into the strange circumstances surrounding Mrs. Vandam’s death.\n\nThe narrative begins with Dr. James Hanson, the coroner’s physician, visiting Kennedy to seek his assistance. Dr. Hanson is perplexed by the case, known widely as the Vandam case, which has fascinated the public and press alike. He outlines the basic facts: Mrs. Vandam was found unconscious by her maid in the library late at night and died the following morning without regaining consciousness. The family physician suggests she died naturally from uremic coma caused by latent kidney disease, but there are suspicions of suicide and even murder. The press has been abuzz with theories, but the case remains unsolved.\n\nDr. Hanson reveals significant details unknown to the public, including the discovery of a pillbox with six morphine-containing capsules, three of which are missing. The pills were prescribed harmlessly for use “one before retiring,” but Dr. Hanson doubts the morphine could have caused Mrs. Vandam’s death. He explains that classic morphine poisoning is typically marked by pupils contracted to pinpoints in a symmetrical fashion, whereas Mrs. Vandam’s pupils were only slightly dilated and symmetrical. This nuanced medical evidence suggests that morphine poisoning was unlikely. The conflicting symptoms and discovery stir further confusion.\n\nCrucial to the mystery is the eccentric Henry Vandam’s obsession with spiritualism. Vandam, deeply influenced by a medium, Mrs. May Popper, and her manager, Howard Farrington, believes in rappings and spirit communication. On the night Mrs. Vandam fell ill, Vandam claims he was awakened by rappings from his spirit “control,” named John, asking about his wife’s condition. This event ostensibly saved Mrs. Vandam by prompting Vandam to send her maid to her side, but the mediumistic communication continues after her death, adding a supernatural element to the case. Vandam reportedly receives nightly rappings spelling out messages from his deceased wife, fueling one theory that the death might connect to these eerie phenomena. The doctor shares these spiritualistic details, though skeptical and attributing them to Vandam’s overwrought imagination.\n\nKennedy obtains permission to examine the Vandam house and autopsy results to explore the morphine question. The house is described as creepy, filled with spirit photographs, paintings, and paraphernalia. An evening visit to Vandam’s seance room shows an old man deeply engrossed in spiritualism, surrounded by items linked to séances and spirit communications. Vandam is convinced his wife communicates from beyond the grave and displays numerous photographs purportedly taken in spiritual manifestations.\n\nKennedy, ever the scientific detective, brings a specially designed apparatus consisting of pendulums and magnets to record vibrations related to the supposed rappings. On the scheduled hour at midnight, a series of rapping noises occur from a cabinet in the room. Vandam questions “John,” meaning the spirit guide, and the raps answer in a code that spells out words. The apparatus records the vibrations, which Kennedy later reviews with satisfaction, concluding the raps come from a physical presence: “a very much flesh-and-blood ghost” who physically moves to tap the cabinet and responds to Vandam’s queries.\n\nThe next stage involves chemical analysis and forensic comparison. Kennedy coordinates with Inspector O’Connor, who secures new capsules prescribed by the doctor and obtains ink samples from key figures connected to the case, including the druggist, Vandam’s household library, Farrington, and Mrs. Popper. This comprehensive investigation aims to unravel whether deception or substitution has occurred with the drug capsules.\n\nKennedy also sets plans for a controlled seance in his laboratory, carefully duplicating Mrs. Popper’s own seance environment through the help of Signor Marina, a craftsman who supplies magical and trick devices to mediums and magicians. This recreation includes the exact furniture, curtains, black carpets, and cabinet placement believed crucial in conducting the seance, ensuring a scientific environment where trickery could be detected.\n\nThe laboratory seance is attended by Henry Vandam, Dr. Hanson, Inspector O’Connor, Kennedy, and the narrator. Mrs. Popper arrives with her manager Farrington, and the atmosphere is tense. Despite the dim lighting and eerie setting, the seance advances with typical spiritistic phenomena like levitating tables and rappings. Kennedy questions the spirit “John” about the capsule substitution, asking if Mrs. Vandam now knows in the afterlife whether anyone changed morphine capsules. The spirit’s response is delayed and faint but present, indicating perturbed reaction.\n\nSuddenly, in a dramatic climax, a wild scream shatters the ethereal mood. Inspector O’Connor, who had slipped quietly under the cabinet curtain, exposes Mrs. Popper’s fraud: she had been producing the raps herself by using her toes, freed secretly from her shoe while Kennedy and others held her hands and feet. Caught red-handed, Mrs. Popper breaks down, while Farrington attempts to defend her by blaming the failure on faint spiritual energies working against them.\n\nKennedy cuts through the defense with clear logic, denouncing the fake seance, revealing the meticulous scientific detective work behind the exposure of the trickery. The story closes with the implication that the case is far from ordinary—a mix of medical complexity, spiritualist deception, and personal intrigue. Kennedy’s methodical approach combining scientific instruments, chemical analysis, psychological insight, and close observation promises future breakthroughs in uncovering the true story behind Mrs. Vandam’s death and the shadowy influence of those around her.\n\n---\n\nOverall, “The Seismograph Adventure” is a classic detective narrative weaving medical science, forensic chemistry, spiritualism, and human intrigue into a suspenseful puzzle. The key elements include the mysterious death with uncertain cause, the involvement of eccentric spiritualism with nightly rappings, the suspicious medium and manager entangled in the family’s affairs, and Kennedy’s methodical, science-driven investigation culminating in the unmasking of fraudulent mediums. The story emphasizes the clash between belief in the supernatural and the power of rational, empirical inquiry in solving baffling criminal mysteries.",
