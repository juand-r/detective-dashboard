    "full_text": "\"The Murder Syndicate,\" a detective story by Unknown, unfolds around an intricate web of conspiracy, assassination, and radical anarchism set against the turbulent backdrop of impending war. The narrative begins abruptly with a frantic young woman, Miss Paula Lowe, urgently seeking Professor Craig Kennedy. Upon gaining entry, she reveals herself as a member of a secret anarchist group committed to ending war by exterminating rulers, financiers, and war-makers through assassination. The group’s crusade, however, has taken a dark turn, and Paula is now desperate, proclaiming her own life is at risk unless she goes through with a planned murder of Baron Krieger—a young, influential German diplomat and financier rallying American sympathy and financial support for Germany.\n\nMiss Lowe, visibly shaken and near hysteria, explains the anarchist organization’s radical ideology: fighting war with war, employing deadly violence aimed not just at political heads but also war financiers. These assassins operate internationally and have coordinated plans for a worldwide series of removals to terrorize governments and prevent future wars. The revelation shocks Professor Kennedy and the narrator, who begin to suspect the enormity and danger of the conspiracy.\n\nPaula discloses that she and another woman, named Marie, were selected to lure the Baron to his assassination at a planned dinner and automobile ride along the Hudson. Yet, as the story progresses, a startling twist emerges: Paula confesses she has fallen in love with Baron Krieger. This passion introduces a volatile element to the plot, as Paula becomes a conflicted traitor against her own anarchist comrades, desperate to save the Baron from being killed.\n\nTheir tense conversation is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Burke, a secret service agent who is investigating alarming developments related to this secret network of assassins, which he refers to as “The Group.” Burke shares shocking news about the mysterious death of Fortescue, an American inventor famed for developing a revolutionary electromagnetic gun— a weapon that is smokeless, noiseless, and far more powerful than conventional arms. Fortescue’s sudden death in his laboratory was inexplicable; he was found lifeless but with no signs of violence, and crucially, the plans for his electromagnetic gun are missing. Given the weapon’s potential to alter the nature of warfare drastically, its disappearance is alarming.\n\nThe intersecting investigations of Professor Kennedy and Burke suggest they are confronting a vast, world-spanning syndicate—“The Murder Syndicate”—composed of intellectuals, social reformers, anarchists, and radicals united by their extremist opposition to war. Among its inner circle are diverse nationalities: Germans including a key figure, Professor Annenberg; his wife, said to be influential in radical circles; French, English, Americans, Russians, Austrians, Spaniards, Italians, and others, all engaged in a shadowy conspiracy. The Group holds clandestine meetings and conspires to eliminate powerful individuals who perpetuate war and conflict.\n\nThe narrative then focuses on systematic detective work as Kennedy, Burke, and the narrator accompany Paula Lowe to Fortescue’s laboratory in New York. The lab is isolated, the scene of the inventor’s death. They find Fortescue’s body positioned on a couch with no external injuries, but evidence such as a peculiar gold-tipped cigarette stub—distinct from Fortescue’s cork-tipped cigarettes—signals a female visitor’s presence and possible involvement in the crime. Kennedy’s sharp forensic intellect unravels details of the electromagnetic gun’s mechanics from blueprints found in a locked filing cabinet, confirming the final plans have been stolen, heightening the urgency of preventing the weapon’s misuse.\n\nDespite efforts, Burke’s attempts to locate Baron Krieger—through banks and hotels—prove futile. Suspicion grows that the anarchists have already set their murderous plot in motion. Miss Lowe’s jealousy toward Marie, the co-assassin who arranged a clandestine meeting with the Baron, adds emotional volatility to the situation, complicating their chances of averting disaster.\n\nDetermined to uncover the heart of the conspiracy, Kennedy presses Paula to identify The Group’s headquarters. She reluctantly reveals it to be at the home of Professor Annenberg on Long Island. Travel to this isolated, run-down house reveals the grim truth behind the intellectual radicals’ facade: the attic serves as the central arsenal and office for the anarchists, containing bomb-making materials, toxic substances, and mountains of incendiary literature advocating war’s violent abolition. The atmosphere is charged with menace, as the weapons of terror and ideological zeal combine.\n\nKennedy, posing carefully to avoid alerting the conspirators, searches through the premises. Among the fiery anti-war tracts titled “The Human Slaughter-House,” he discovers a secret compartment concealing an envelope marked “E-M GUN,” once again empty, confirming the electromagnetic gun plans are hidden or already removed.\n\nBefore they can investigate further, Kennedy receives a telephone call—likely from Mrs. Annenberg—who cunningly cuts off communication before revealing any information. Tracing the call leads to a tenement address in East Fifth Street, New York, suggesting the syndicate’s reach extends covertly into urban hideouts, layering the mystery.\n\nThroughout these events, the tension mounts. The alliance of Kennedy, Burke, and the narrator symbolizes the forces of law and reason seeking to thwart an ominous, well-organized conspiracy that threatens global instability through targeted murders and theft of dangerous technologies. Paula Lowe’s inner turmoil, torn between revolutionary fanaticism and newfound love, epitomizes the story’s emotional stakes and the personal cost of radicalism.\n\nIn summary, \"The Murder Syndicate\" is a complex detective thriller that intertwines themes of political extremism, the horrors of war, and technological innovation with a suspenseful investigation of anarchist plots. It portrays a secret international cabal dedicated to terrorism as a misguided means to peace, using assassination as a weapon to eradicate war-makers. With the mysterious death of a brilliant inventor, the theft of a groundbreaking electromagnetic weapon, and the endangered life of a prominent German diplomat, the story delves deep into the shadowy world of espionage, ideological conflict, and the high stakes of futuristic armaments. The protagonists’ race against time to unravel the conspiracy, protect innocent lives, and prevent a catastrophic chain of violence encapsulates a tangled narrative of intrigue, moral ambiguity, and desperate courage.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe problem really breaks itself into two linked questions:\n\nA.  Who killed the American inventor, Fortescue, and carried off the plans for his\n    electromagnetic (“E-M”) gun?\n\nB.  Who is directing the projected assassination of Baron Krieger?\n\nThe two answers must be consistent with the ONE set of clues placed in the\nstory.  \nTo reach them I tested each important character against the classic grid\nMotive – Opportunity – Means – Physical evidence – Alibi, and then asked\nwhether the same person (or persons) could fit both crimes.\n\n1.  Professor Annenberg  \n    • Motive – As acknowledged head of the Murder Syndicate, all\n      “war-makers” and all new engines of war are marked for destruction; Fortescue’s\n      silent, smokeless super-gun is therefore a prime target.  \n    • Opportunity –  Lives on Long Island (easy night train/boat trip to\n      Manhattan), keeps an arsenal in his own attic, and there is no alibi for the\n      evening of Fortescue’s death.  \n    • Means –  A scientist himself; perfectly able to understand the gun\n      drawings and to operate the weapon once Fortescue had obligingly set it up.  \n    • Physical evidence –  In Annenberg’s attic Kennedy finds the empty\n      envelope marked “E-M GUN,” proving that the plans travelled directly from the\n      laboratory to that house.  \n    • Telephone –  The call that cuts Kennedy off is traced to a cheap\n      tenement in East Fifth Street, i.e. a convenient city hide-out for the\n      Annenbergs while they are operating in Manhattan.﻿\n\n2.  Mrs. Annenberg  \n    • Motive –  As co-organiser of the Syndicate and the one who recruits the women\n      assassins, she has the same motive as her husband.  \n    • Opportunity –  She is the person actually found in town (telephone\n      trace); nothing keeps her away from Fortescue’s laboratory.  \n    • Means –  She smokes gold-tipped cigarettes, the identical kind of stub\n      lying beside Fortescue’s body — the one tangible clue in the room.  \n    • No alibi is offered; on the contrary she tries to prevent the detectives\n      from getting information (cuts off the telephone call).\n\n3.  Paula Lowe  \n    • Motive –  In theory she also wants to stop war, but she is now openly\n      betraying the Society in order to save the Baron.  \n    • Opportunity –  She was with Kennedy and Jameson when the body was found;\n      therefore she could not have planted the stub or carried the plans to\n      Long Island.  \n    • Evidence –  Nothing links her to the electromagnetic gun papers.\n\n4.  Marie  \n    • Motive – still loyal to the plot.  \n    • Opportunity – may have lured the Baron elsewhere at the very moment\n      Fortescue was dying, but there is no proof she ever entered the laboratory.  \n    • Evidence – none except the fact that she smokes (brand unknown).\n\n5.  Burke, Baron Krieger, miscellaneous anarchists – each lacks either clear\n   motive, opportunity, or any piece of physical evidence, and nothing found\n   in Annenberg’s attic ties them directly to Fortescue’s death.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n• There is ONE female visitor proved to have been inside\n  Fortescue’s laboratory (gold-tipped cigarette).  \n• There is ONE place in which the stolen plans are definitely\n  discovered later (secret compartment in Professor Annenberg’s attic).  \n• The only woman with free access both to the laboratory that night and to\n  the Annenberg attic is MRS. ANNENBERG; the only man with the power to plan and\n  profit from the theft is PROFESSOR ANNENBERG.\n\nTherefore the murder of Fortescue and the theft of the E-M gun plans were a\nhusband-and-wife operation.  The projected murder of Baron Krieger is simply\nthe next item on their Syndicate agenda, to be carried out by the foot-soldiers\n(Paula, Marie, etc.).\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nProfessor Otto Annenberg, Mrs. Annenberg, Miss Paula Lowe, Marie (surname unknown), Baron Krieger, Burke (Secret-Service), unnamed members of “the Group”\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nProfessor Otto Annenberg  \nMrs. Annenberg\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nMarie (operative assigned to the Krieger assassination)  \nOther unnamed members of the Murder Syndicate\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1.  Professor and Mrs. Annenberg learn through Syndicate channels that\n    Fortescue has perfected a noiseless electromagnetic gun.  Because such a\n    weapon would intensify the coming war instead of ending it, they decide to\n    confiscate the plans and silence the inventor.\n\n2.  On the night in question Mrs. Annenberg, posing as an interested\n    “pacifist” patroness, visits Fortescue’s New-York laboratory.  She smokes\n    her habitual gold-tipped cigarettes, one of which she casually drops.\n\n3.  While she keeps Fortescue talking, Professor Annenberg slips in through\n    the side door.  The unsuspecting inventor demonstrates the assembled gun.\n    At the critical moment the Professor swings the muzzle on Fortescue and\n    fires.  The electric projectile kills instantly, leaving no surface wound.\n\n4.  The Annenbergs remove the final blue-prints, lock the rest of the file in\n    the cabinet (to delay discovery), and drive to their East Fifth-Street\n    hide-out.  From that tenement Mrs. Annenberg telephones her Long-Island\n    house to warn subordinates to prepare the attic cache.\n\n5.  The next morning the plans are smuggled to Long Island and placed in the\n    secret compartment labelled “E-M GUN.”  The Syndicate now owns both the\n    weapon and the secret of its manufacture.\n\n6.  Simultaneously the Annenbergs put the second part of their programme in\n    motion:  the selective assassination of Baron Krieger.  Marie is detailed\n    to lure him to a lonely stretch of the Hudson; Paula Lowe is to act as\n    “double assurance.”  Paula’s sudden infatuation with the Baron, however,\n    drives her to betray the plot and to enlist Craig Kennedy’s aid.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Miss Paula Lowe – She is the whistle-blower; her movements are under\n  Kennedy’s eye from the moment the body is discovered.  No stolen plans are\n  found in her possession and no physical clue ties her to the laboratory.  \n\n• Marie – Although still loyal to the Syndicate, no evidence puts her at\n  Fortescue’s lab.  Her rôle is limited to the prospective Krieger murder.  \n\n• Baron Krieger – He profits in no way from Fortescue’s death and is in fact\n  being stalked as the next victim.  \n\n• Agent Burke – His sole function is to investigate; he never has unsupervised\n  access to either the laboratory or the Annenberg house.  \n\n• Rank-and-file anarchists – They follow orders but nothing places them in the\n  laboratory on the fatal night, nor in possession of the gun plans.\n\nThus the only characters who satisfy every requirement of motive,\nopportunity, means, and matching physical evidence are Professor and\nMrs. Annenberg — the joint masters of the Murder Syndicate. </WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "text": "\"I MUST see Professor Kennedy! Where is he? I must see him!\"\n\nI was almost carried off my feet by the inrush of a wild-eyed girl. Startled by my own involuntary exclamation of surprise, which followed the vision that shot past me as I opened our door in response to a sudden, sharp series of pushes at the buzzer, Kennedy bounded swiftly toward me, and the girl almost flung herself upon him.\n\n\"Why, Miss—Dr—Miss—my dear young lady—what's the matter?\" he stammered, catching her by the arm gently.\n\nAs Kennedy forced our strange visitor into a chair, I observed that she was all atremble. Plainly there was something she feared. She was almost over the verge of hysteria.\n\nShe was a striking girl, of medium height and slender form, but it was her face that fascinated me, with its delicately- molded features, intense, unfathomable eyes of dark brown, and lips that showed her idealistic, high-strung temperament.\n\n\"Please,\" Kennedy soothed, \"get yourself together. What is the matter?\"\n\nShe looked about, as if she feared that the very walls had eyes and ears. Yet there seemed to be something bursting from her lips that she could not restrain.\n\n\"My life,\" she cried wildly. \"Oh, help me, help me! Unless I commit a murder to-night, I shall be killed myself!\"\n\nThe words sounded so doubly strange from a girl of her evident refinement that I watched her narrowly, not sure yet but that this was a plain case of insanity.\n\n\"A murder!\" repeated Kennedy incredulously. \"You commit a murder!\"\n\n\"Yes—Baron Krieger—you know—the German diplomatist and financier who is in America raising money and arousing sympathy for his country.\"\n\n\"Baron Krieger!\" exclaimed Kennedy, in surprise, looking at her more keenly.\n\nWe had not met the Baron, but we had heard much about him—young, handsome, of an old family, trusted already, in spite of his youth, by many of the more advanced of Old-World financial and political leaders, one who had made a most favorable impression on democratic America at a time when such impressions were valuable.\n\nGlancing from one of us to the other, she seemed suddenly, with a great effort, to recollect herself, for she reached into her chatelaine and pulled out a card from a case. It read simply, \"Miss Paula Lowe.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, more calmly now, to Kennedy's repetition of the baron's name; \"you see, I belong to a secret group. I am an anarchist.\"\n\nShe watched the effect of her confession, and finding the look on Kennedy's face encouraging rather than shocked, went on breathlessly: \"We are fighting war with war—this iron-bound organization of men and women. We have pledged ourselves to exterminate all kings, emperors, and rulers, ministers of war, generals—but first of all the financiers who lend money that makes war possible. We are going to make another war impossible!\"\n\n\"And your plan?\" prompted Kennedy, in the most matter-of-fact manner. \"How-were you to—reach the baron?\"\n\n\"We had a drawing,\" she answered, with amazing calmness. \"Another woman and I were chosen. We knew the baron's weakness for a pretty face. We planned to lure him on.\"\n\nHer voice trailed off as if, the first burst of confidence over, she felt something that would lock her secret tighter in her breast.\n\nA moment later she resumed, now talking rapidly, disconnectedly.\n\n\"You don't know, Professor Kennedy,\" she now explained, \"but there are similar groups to ours in European countries, and the plan is to strike terror and consternation everywhere in the world at once. Why, at our headquarters here, have been drawn up plans and agreements with other groups, and there are set down the time, place, and manner of all the—the removals.\"\n\nMomentarily she seemed to be carried away by something like the fanaticism of the fervor which had at first captured her— even still held her.\n\n\"Oh, can't you understand?\" she went on, as if to justify herself. \"The increase in armies, the frightful implements of slaughter, the total failure of the peace propaganda—they have all defied civilization!\n\n\"And then, too, the old, red-blooded emotions of battle have all been eliminated by the mechanical conditions of modern warfare, in which men and women are just so many units, automata.. Don't you see? To fight war with its own weapons—that has become the only, the last resort.\"\n\nHer eager, flushed face betrayed the enthusiasm which had once carried her into \"The Group,\" as she called it. I wondered what had brought her now to us.\n\n\"We are no longer making war against man!\" she cried. \"We are making war against picric acid and electric wires!\"\n\nI could not help thinking that there was no doubt, that to a certain type of mind, such reasoning might appeal most strongly.\n\n\"And you would do it in war-time, too?\" asked Kennedy quickly.\n\nShe was ready with an answer. \"King George of Greece was killed at the head of his troops. Remember Nazim Pasha, too. Such people are easily reached in time of peace—and in time of war, also—by sympathizers on their own side. That's it, you see—we have followers of all nationalities.\" She stopped, her burst of enthusiasm spent. A moment later she leaned forward, her clean-cut profile showing her more earnest than before.\n\n\"But, oh, Professor Kennedy,\" she added, \"it is working itself out to be more terrible than war itself!\"\n\n\"Have any of the plans been carried out yet?\" asked Craig, I thought a little superciliously.\n\nShe seemed to catch her breath.\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured, then checked herself. \"That is, I—I think so.\"\n\nI wondered if she were concealing something, perhaps had already had a hand in some such enterprise, and was frightened.\n\nKennedy leaned forward, observing the girl's discomfiture. \"Miss Lowe,\" he said, catching her eye and holding it almost hypnotically, \"why have you come here?\"\n\nThe question, pointblank, seemed to startle her. Evidently she had thought to tell only as little as necessary, and in her own way. But Kennedy's eyes conquered.\n\n\"Oh, can't you understand yet?\" she exclaimed, rising passionately and throwing out her arms in appeal. \"I was carried away with my hatred of war. I hate it. But now—the sudden realization of what this compact all means has—well, caused something in me to—to snap. I don't care what oath I have taken. Oh, you—you must save him!\"\n\nWhat did she mean? At first she had come to be saved herself.\n\n\"You must save him!\" she implored.\n\nOur door buzzer sounded.\n\nShe gazed about with a hunted look, as if she felt that some one had, even now, pursued her and found her out.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Quick—in here. No one will know,\" urged Kennedy, opening the door to his room. He paused for an instant. \"Tell me—have you and this other woman met the baron yet? How far has it gone?\"\n\nThe look she gave him was peculiar. I could not fathom what was going on in her mind. But she did not hesitate.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied; \"I—we have met him. He is to come back to New York from Washington to-day—this afternoon—to arrange a private loan of five million dollars secretly with some bankers We were to see him, to-night—a quiet dinner, after an automobile ride up the Hudson—\"\n\n\"Both of you?\" interrupted Craig.\n\n\"Yes—that—that other woman and my-self,\" she repeated. \"To-night was the time fixed in the drawing for the—\"\n\nThe word stuck in her throat. Kennedy understood. \"Yes, yes,\" he encouraged; \"but who is the other woman?\"\n\nBefore she could reply, the buzzer had sounded again, and she had retreated from the door. Quickly Kennedy closed it and opened the outside door. It was our old friend Burke, of the secret service.\n\nWithout a word of greeting, a hasty glance seemed to assure him that Craig and I were alone.\n\n\"Kennedy,\" he blurted out, in a tone of suppressed excitement, \"can I trust you to keep a big secret?\"\n\nCraig looked at him reproachfully, but said nothing.\n\n\"I beg your pardon—a thousand times,\" hastened Burke. \"I was so excited.\"\n\n\"Once is enough, Burke,\" laughed Kennedy, his good nature restored at Burke's crestfallen appearance.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" went on the secret-service man, \"this thing is so very important that, well, I forgot.\"\n\nHe sat down and hitched his chair close to us.\n\n\"Kennedy,\" he whispered, \"I'm on the trail, I think, of something growing out of these terrible conditions in Europe that will tax the best in the secret service. Think of it, man. There's an organization, right here in this city, a sort of assassins' club, as it were, aimed at all the powerful men the world over. Why, the most refined and intellectual reformers have joined with the most red-handed anarchists and—\"\n\n\"Sh, not so loud!\" cautioned Craig. \"I think I have one of them in the next room. Have they done anything yet to the baron?\"\n\nIt was Burke's turn, now, to look from one to the other of us in unfeigned surprise.\n\n\"The baron?\" he repeated, lowering his voice. \"What baron?\"\n\nIt was evident that Burke knew nothing, at least of this new plot. Kennedy beckoned him over to the window furthest from the door to his own room.\n\n\"What have you discovered?\" he asked, forestalling Burke in the questioning. \"What has happened?\"\n\n\"You haven't heard, then?\"\n\nKennedy nodded negatively.\n\n\"Fortescue, the American inventor of fortescite, the new explosive, died very strangely this morning.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" encouraged Kennedy.\n\n\"Most incomprehensible, too,\" Burke pursued. \"No cause, apparently. But it might have been overlooked, perhaps, except for one thing: It wasn't known generally, but Fortescue had just perfected a successful electromagnetic gun—powderless, smokeless, flashless, noiseless, and of tremendous power. To- morrow he was to have signed the contract to sell it to England. This morning he is found dead, and the final plans of the gun are gone!\"\n\nKennedy and Burke were standing mutely looking at each other.\n\n\"Who is in the next room?\" whispered Burke, hoarsely, recollecting Kennedy's caution of silence.\n\nKennedy did not reply immediately. He was evidently much excited by Burke's news of the wonderful electromagnetic gun.\n\n\"Burke,\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"let's join forces. I think we are both on the trail of a world-wide conspiracy—a sort of murder syndicate to wipe out war!\"\n\nBurke's only reply was a low whistle, which involuntarily escaped him as he reached over and grasped Craig's hand, which, to him, represented the sealing of the compact. Hastily Craig gave a whispered account of our strange visit from Miss Lowe, while Burke listened, open-mouthed.\n\nHe had scarcely finished when he reached for the telephone and called for Long Distance.\n\n\"Is this the German embassy?\" asked Craig, a few moments later, when he got his number. \"This is Craig Kennedy, in New York. The United States secret service will vouch for me—mention to them Mr. Burke of their New York office, who is here with me now. I understand that Baron Krieger is leaving for New York to meet some bankers this afternoon. He must not do so. What? He left last night at midnight and is already here?\"\n\nKennedy turned to us blankly.\n\nThe door to his room opened suddenly.\n\nThere stood Miss Lowe, gazing wild-eyed at us. She had heard what we were saying. I tried to read her face. It was not fear that I saw there. It was rage; it was jealousy.\n\n\"The traitress—it is Marie!\" she shrieked. \"She has made a secret appointment with him.\"\n\nAt last I saw the truth. Paula Lowe had fallen in love with the man she had sworn to kill!\n\n\"What shall we do?\" demanded Burke, instantly taking in the dangerous situation.\n\n\"Call O'Connor,\" I suggested, thinking of the police bureau of missing persons, and reaching for the telephone.\n\n\"No, no!\" almost shouted Craig, seizing my arm. \"The police will inevitably spoil it all. No; we must play a lone hand in this, if we are to work it out. How was Fortescue discovered, Burke?\"\n\n\"Sitting in a chair in his laboratory. He must have been there all night. There wasn't a mark on him, not a sign of violence, yet his face was terribly drawn, as though he were gasping for breath or his heart had suddenly failed him. So far, I believe, the coroner has no clue and isn't advertising the case.\"\n\n\"Take me there, then,\" decided Craig quickly. \"Walter, I must trust Miss Lowe to you on the journey. We must all go. That must be our starting-point.\"\n\nI caught his significant look to me and interpreted it to mean that he wanted me to watch Miss Lowe especially. I gathered that taking her was in the nature of a \"third degree,\" and, as a result, he expected to derive some information from her. Her face was pale and drawn as we four piled into a taxi-cab for a quick run down-town to Fortescue's laboratory.\n\n\"What do you know of these anarchists?\" asked Kennedy of Burke, as we sped along. \"Why do you suspect them?\"\n\nIt was evident that he was discussing the case so that Paula could overhear.\n\n\"Why, we received a tip from abroad—I won't say where,\" replied Burke guardedly, taking his cue. \"They call themselves 'The Group.' It seems they are composed of terrorists of all nations.\"\n\n\"The leader?\" inquired Kennedy.\n\n\"There is one, I believe, a little florid, stout German. I think he, is a paranoiac who believes there has fallen on himself a divine mission to end all warfare. Quite likely he is one of those who have fled to America to avoid military service. Perhaps—why certainly, you must know him—Annenberg, an instructor in economics at the university?\"\n\nCraig nodded and raised his eyebrows in mild surprise. We had indeed heard of Annenberg and some of his radical theories, which had sometimes quite alarmed the conservative faculty.\n\n\"How about Mrs. Annenberg?\" Craig asked, recalling the clever young wife of the middle-aged professor.\n\nAt the mere mention of the name, I felt a sort of start from Miss Lowe, who was seated next to me in the taxi-cab. She had quickly recovered herself, but not before I saw that Kennedy's plan of breaking down the last barrier of her reserve was working.\n\n\"She is one of them, too,\" Burke nodded. \"J have had my men out shadowing them and their friends. They tell me that the Annenbergs hold salons—I suppose you would call them that—attended by numbers of men and women of high social and intellectual position who dabble in radicalism and all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"Who are the other leaders?\" asked Craig. \"Have you any idea?\"\n\n\"Some idea,\" returned Burke. \"There seems to be a Frenchman, a tall, wiry man of forty-five or fifty, with a black mustache which once had a military twist. There are a couple of Englishmen. Then there are five or six Americans who seem to be active. One, I believe, is a young woman.\"\n\nKennedy checked him with a covert glance, but did not betray by a movement of a muscle to Miss Lowe that either he or Burke suspected her.\n\n\"There are three Russians,\" continued Burke, \"all of whom have escaped from Siberia. Then there is at least one Austrian, a Spaniard from the Ferrer school, and Tommaso and Enrico, two Italians. These in the main, I think, compose what might be called 'the inner circle' of 'The Group.'\"\n\nIt was indeed an alarming, terrifying revelation, as we began to realize that Miss Lowe had undoubtedly been telling the truth. Not alone was there this American group, evidently, but all over Europe the lines of the conspiracy had apparently spread. It was not a casual gathering of ordinary malcontents. It went deeper than that. It included many who, in their disgust at war, secretly were not unwilling to wink at violence to end the curse.\n\nThe big facts to us, just at present, were that this group had made America its headquarters, that plans had been studiously matured and even reduced to writing, if Paula were to be believed. Everything had been carefully staged for a great, simultaneous blow or series of blows.\n\nAs I watched, I could not escape observing that Miss Lowe looked at Burke furtively now, as though he had some uncanny power.\n\nFortescue's laboratory was in an old building on a side street several blocks from the main thoroughfares of Manhattan. He had evidently chosen it partly because of its very inaccessibility.\n\n\"If he had any visitors last night,\" commented Kennedy, when our cab at last pulled up before the place, \"they might have come and gone unnoticed.\"\n\nWe entered. Nothing had been disturbed in the laboratory by the coroner, and Kennedy was able rapidly to gain a complete idea of the case.\n\nFortescue's body, it seemed, had been discovered sprawled out in a big armchair, as Burke had said, by one of his assistants only a few hours before, when he had come to the laboratory in the morning to open it. Evidently the body of the inventor had been there undisturbed all night.\n\nAs we gleaned the meager facts, it became more evident that whoever had perpetrated the crime must have had the diabolical cunning to do it in some ordinary way that aroused no suspicion on the part of the victim, for there was no sign of any violence anywhere.\n\nFortescue's body had been removed from the chair in which it had been found and lay on a couch at the other end of the room, covered merely by a sheet. Otherwise, everything was undisturbed.\n\nKennedy pulled back a corner of the sheet, disclosing the face, contorted, and of a peculiar purplish hue from the congested blood-vessels. He bent over, and I did so, too. There was an unmistakable odor of tobacco from the body. A moment Kennedy studied the face before us, then slowly replaced the sheet.\n\nMiss Lowe had paused just inside the door and seemed resolutely bound not to look at anything. Kennedy, meanwhile, had begun a most minute search of the laboratory.\n\nIn my effort to glean what I could from her actions and expressions, I did not notice that Craig had dropped to his knees and was peering into the shadow under the laboratory table. When at last he rose and straightened himself up, however, I saw that he was holding in the palm of his hand a half-smoked, gold-tipped cigarette, which had evidently fallen on the floor beneath the table, where it had burned itself out.\n\nAn instant afterward he picked out from the pile of articles found in Fortescue's pockets and lying on another table a silver cigarette-case. He snapped it open. Fortescue's cigarettes, of which there were perhaps a half-dozen in the case, were cork- tipped. Some one had evidently visited him the night before and had apparently offered him a cigarette, for there were any number of the cork-tipped stubs lying about. Who was it? I caught Paula looking with fascinated gaze at the gold-tipped stub, as Kennedy carefully folded it up in a piece of paper and deposited it in his pocket. Did she know something about the case?\n\nWithout a word, Kennedy seemed to take in the scant furniture of the laboratory at a glance, and a quick step or two brought him before a steel filing-cabinet. One drawer projected a bit. On its face was a little typewritten card bearing the inscription: E-M GUN.\n\nHe pulled the drawer open and glanced over the data in it.\n\n\"Just what is an electromagnetic gun?\" I asked, interpreting the initials on the drawer.\n\n\"Well,\" he explained, as he turned over the notes and sketches, \"the primary principle involved in the construction of such a gun consists in impelling the projectile by the magnetic action of a solenoid, the sectional coils or helices of which are supplied with current through devices actuated by the projectile itself. In other words, the sections of helices of the solenoid produce an accelerated motion of the projectile by acting successively on it, after a principle involved in the construction of electromagnetic rock-drills and despatch- tubes.\n\n\"All projectiles used in this gun of Fortescue's evidently must have magnetic properties and projectiles of iron or containing large portions of iron. You see, many coils are wound around the barrel of the gun. As the projectile starts, it does so under the attraction of those coils ahead, which the current makes temporary magnets. It automatically cuts off the current from those coils that it passes, allowing those further on only to attract it, and preventing those behind from pulling it back.\"\n\nHe paused to study the scraps of plans. \"Fortescue had evidently also worked out a way of changing the poles of the coils as the projectile passed, causing them to repel the projectile, which must have added to its velocity.\"\n\nHe continued turning over the prints and notes in the drawer. When he finished, he looked up at us with an expression that indicated that he had merely satisfied himself of something he had already suspected.\n\n\"You were right, Burke,\" he said; \"the final plans are gone.\"\n\nBurke who, in the meantime, had been telephoning about the city in a vain effort to locate Baron Krieger, both at such banking-offices in Wall Street as he might be likely to visit and at some of the hotels most frequented by foreigners, merely nodded. He was evidently at a loss completely how to proceed.\n\nIn fact, there seemed to be innumerable problems—to warn Baron Krieger, to get the list of the assassinations, to guard Miss Lowe against falling into the hands of her anarchist friends again, to find the murderer of Fortescue, to prevent the use of the electromagnetic gun, and, if possible, to seize the anarchists before they had a chance to carry their plans further.\n\n\"There is nothing more that we can do here,\" remarked Craig briskly, betraying no sign of hesitation. \"I think the best thing we can do is to go to my own laboratory. There, at least, there is something I must investigate sooner or later.\"\n\nNo one offering either a suggestion or an objection, we four again entered our cab. It was quite noticeable, now, that the visit had shaken Paula Lowe, but Kennedy still studiously refrained from questioning her, trusting that what she had seen and heard would have its effect.\n\nLike everyone visiting Craig's laboratory for the first time, Miss Lowe seemed to feel the spell of the innumerable strange and uncanny instruments which he had gathered about him in his scientific warfare against crime. I could see that she was becoming more and more nervous, perhaps fearing, even, that, in some incomprehensible way, he might read her own thoughts. Yet one thing I did not detect: she showed no disposition to turn back on the course on which she had entered by coming to us.\n\nKennedy was quickly and deftly testing the stub of the little thin, gold-tipped cigarette. \"Excessive smoking,\" he remarked casually, \"causes neuroses of the heart, and tobacco has a specific affinity for the coronary arteries as well as a tremendous effect on the vagus nerve. But I don't think this was any ordinary smoke.\"\n\nHe had finished his tests, and a quiet smile of satisfaction flitted momentarily over his face.\n\nAs he looked up he remarked to us, with his eyes fixed on Miss Lowe: \"That was a lady's cigarette. Did you notice the size? There has been a woman in this case.\"\n\nThe girl, suddenly transformed by the rapid-fire succession of discoveries, stood before us like a specter.\n\n\"'The Group,' as anarchists call it,\" pursued Craig, \"is the loosest sort of organization conceivable, I believe, with no set membership, no officers, no laws—just a place of meeting. Could you get us into the inner circle, Miss Lowe?\"\n\nHer only answer was a little suppressed scream. Kennedy had asked the question merely for its effect, for it was only too evident that there was no time for us to play the stool- pigeon.\n\nKennedy, who had been clearing up the materials he had used in the analysis of the cigarette, wheeled about suddenly.\n\n\"Where is the headquarters of the inner circle?\" he shot out.\n\nMiss Lowe hesitated.\n\n\"Tell me,\" insisted Kennedy; \"you must!\"\n\nIf it had been Burke's bulldozing, she would never have yielded. But as she looked into Kennedy's eyes, she read there that he had long since fathomed the secret of her wildly beating heart, that if she would accomplish the purpose of saving the baron, she must stop at nothing.\n\n\"At—Maplehurst,\" she answered, in a low tone, dropping her eyes from his penetrating gaze, \"Professor Annenberg's home—out on Long Island.\"\n\n\"We must act swiftly if we are to succeed,\" considered Kennedy, his tone betraying rather sympathy with than triumph over the wretched girl who had, at last, cast everything in the balance to outweigh the terrible situation into which she had been drawn. \"To send Miss Lowe for that fatal list of assassinations is to send her either back into the power of this murderous group or perhaps to involve her again in the completion of their plans.\"\n\nShe sank back into a chair in complete nervous and physical collapse at the realization that in her new-found passion to save the baron, she had bared her sensitive soul for the dissection of three men whom she had never seen before.\n\n\"We must have that list,\" pursued Kennedy decisively. \"We must visit Annenberg's headquarters.\"\n\n\"And I?\" she asked, trembling, now, with genuine fear at the thought that he might ask her to accompany us, as he had on our visit to Fortescue's laboratory.\n\n\"Miss Lowe,\" said Kennedy, bending over her, \"you have gone too far, now, ever to turn back. You are not equal to the trip. Would you like to remain here? No one will suspect. Here, at least, you will be safe until we return.\"\n\nHer answer was a mute expression of thanks and confidence.\n\nQuickly now Craig completed his arrangements for the visit to the headquarters of the real anarchist leader. Burke telephoned for a high-powered car, while Miss Lowe told frankly of the habits of Annenberg and the chances of finding his place unguarded, which were good in the daytime. Kennedy's only equipment for the excursion consisted in a small package which he took from a cabinet at the end of the room, and, with a parting reassurance to Paula Lowe, we were soon speeding over the bridge to the borough across the river.\n\nOur quest took us to a rather dilapidated old house on the outskirts of the little Long Island town. The house stood alone, not far from the tracks of a trolley that ran at infrequent intervals, and even a hasty reconnoitering showed that to stop our motor at even a reasonable distance from it was in itself to arouse suspicion.\n\nAlthough the house seemed deserted, Craig took no chances, but directed the car to turn at the next cross-road and then run back along a road back of and parallel to that on which Annenberg's was situated. It was perhaps a quarter of a mile away that we stopped and ran the car up along the side of the road into some bushes. Annenberg's was plainly visible, and it was not at all likely that anyone there would suspect trouble from that quarter.\n\nA hasty conference with Burke followed, in which Kennedy unwrapped his small package, leaving part of its contents with him and adding careful instructions.\n\nThen Kennedy and I retraced our steps back to the mysterious house.\n\nTo all appearance there had been no need of such excessive caution. Not a sound or motion greeted us as we entered the gate and made our way around to the rear. The very isolation of the house was now our protection, for we had no inquisitive neighbors to watch us for the instant when Kennedy, with the dexterity of a yeggman, inserted his knife between the sashes of the kitchen window and turned the catch.\n\nWe made our way on cautious tiptoe through a dining-room to a living-room, and, finding nothing, proceeded up-stairs. There was nothing to indicate that it was different from most small suburban homes, until, at last, we mounted to the attic.\n\nThis was finished off as one large room across the back of the house and two in front. As we opened the door to the large room, we could only gaze about in surprise. This was the rendezvous, the arsenal, literary, explosive, and toxicological of, \"The Group.\" Ranged on a table were all the materials for bomb making, while in a cabinet I fancied there were poisons enough to decimate a city.\n\nKennedy sniffed. Over all I, too, could catch the faint odor of stale tobacco. No time was to be lost, however, and while Craig set to work, rapidly going through the contents of a desk in the corner, I glanced over the contents of a drawer of a heavy Mission table.\n\n\"Here's some of Annenberg's literature,\" I remarked, coming across a small pile of manuscript, entitled \"The Human Slaughter- House.\"\n\n\"Read it,\" panted Kennedy; \"it may give a clue.\"\n\nHastily I scanned the mad, frantic indictment of war.\n\n### Quote\n\nI see wild beasts all around me, distorted unnaturally, in a life-and-death-struggle, with bloodshot eyes, with foaming, gnashing mouths. They attack and kill one another and try to mangle each other. I leap to my feet. I race out into the night and tread on quaking flesh, step on hard heads, and stumble over weapons and helmets. Something is clutching at my feet like hands, so that I race away like a hunted deer with the hounds at his heels—and ever over more bodies—breathless, out of one field into another. Horror is crooning over my head. Horror is crooning beneath my feet. And nothing but dying, mangled flesh!\n\nOf a sudden, I see nothing but blood before me. The heavens have opened, and the red blood pours in through the windows. Blood wells up on an altar. The walls run blood from the ceiling to the floor, and a giant of blood stands before me. His beard and his hair drip blood. He seats himself on the altar and laughs from thick lips. The black executioner raises his sword and whirls it above my head. Another moment, and my head will roll down on the floor. Another moment, and the red jet will spurt from my neck.\n\nMurderers! Murderers! None other than murderers!\n\nI paused in the reading. \"There's nothing here,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Craig contemplatively, \"one can at least easily understand how sensitive and imaginative people who have fallen under the influence of one who writes in that way can feel justified in killing those who bring such horrors on the human race—Hello—what's this?\"\n\nHe had discovered a false back of one of the drawers in the desk and had jimmied it open. On the top of innumerable papers lay a large linen envelop. On its face it bore in typewriting—just like the card on the drawer at Fortescue's—E-M GUN.\n\n\"It is the original envelop that contained the final plans of the electromagnetic gun,\" he explained, opening it.\n\nThe envelop was empty. What had been done with the plans?\n\nSuddenly a bell rang, startling me beyond measure. It was, however, only the telephone, of which an extension reached up into the attic arsenal. Kennedy quickly unhooked the receiver.\n\n\"Hello!\" I heard him answer. \"Yes; this is it.\"\n\nHe had disguised his voice. I waited anxiously and watched his face.\n\n\"The deuce!\" he exclaimed, with his hand over the transmitter so that his voice would not be heard at the other end of the line.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked eagerly.\n\n\"It was Mrs. Annenberg—I am sure. But she was too keen for me. She caught on. There must be some password or form of expression that they use, for she has hung up the receiver.\"\n\nKennedy waited a minute or so. Then he whistled into the transmitter. It was done apparently to see whether there was anyone listening. But there was no answer.\n\n\"Operator! Operator!\" he called insistently, moving the hook up and down. \"Yes, operator. Can you tell me what number that was which just called?\"\n\nHe waited impatiently.\n\n\"Bleecker—7180,\" he repeated, after the girl. \"Thank you. Information, please.\"\n\nAgain we waited, as Craig tried to trace the call.\n\n\"What is the street-address of Bleecker, 7180?\" he asked. \"Five hundred and one, East Fifth—a tenement. Thank you.\"\n\n\"A tenement?\" I repeated blankly.\n\n",
      "prompt": "Summarize the following document for Detective story 'The Murder Syndicate' by Unknown. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\n\"I MUST see Professor Kennedy! Where is he? I must see him!\"\n\nI was almost carried off my feet by the inrush of a wild-eyed girl. Startled by my own involuntary exclamation of surprise, which followed the vision that shot past me as I opened our door in response to a sudden, sharp series of pushes at the buzzer, Kennedy bounded swiftly toward me, and the girl almost flung herself upon him.\n\n\"Why, Miss—Dr—Miss—my dear young lady—what's the matter?\" he stammered, catching her by the arm gently.\n\nAs Kennedy forced our strange visitor into a chair, I observed that she was all atremble. Plainly there was something she feared. She was almost over the verge of hysteria.\n\nShe was a striking girl, of medium height and slender form, but it was her face that fascinated me, with its delicately- molded features, intense, unfathomable eyes of dark brown, and lips that showed her idealistic, high-strung temperament.\n\n\"Please,\" Kennedy soothed, \"get yourself together. What is the matter?\"\n\nShe looked about, as if she feared that the very walls had eyes and ears. Yet there seemed to be something bursting from her lips that she could not restrain.\n\n\"My life,\" she cried wildly. \"Oh, help me, help me! Unless I commit a murder to-night, I shall be killed myself!\"\n\nThe words sounded so doubly strange from a girl of her evident refinement that I watched her narrowly, not sure yet but that this was a plain case of insanity.\n\n\"A murder!\" repeated Kennedy incredulously. \"You commit a murder!\"\n\n\"Yes—Baron Krieger—you know—the German diplomatist and financier who is in America raising money and arousing sympathy for his country.\"\n\n\"Baron Krieger!\" exclaimed Kennedy, in surprise, looking at her more keenly.\n\nWe had not met the Baron, but we had heard much about him—young, handsome, of an old family, trusted already, in spite of his youth, by many of the more advanced of Old-World financial and political leaders, one who had made a most favorable impression on democratic America at a time when such impressions were valuable.\n\nGlancing from one of us to the other, she seemed suddenly, with a great effort, to recollect herself, for she reached into her chatelaine and pulled out a card from a case. It read simply, \"Miss Paula Lowe.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, more calmly now, to Kennedy's repetition of the baron's name; \"you see, I belong to a secret group. I am an anarchist.\"\n\nShe watched the effect of her confession, and finding the look on Kennedy's face encouraging rather than shocked, went on breathlessly: \"We are fighting war with war—this iron-bound organization of men and women. We have pledged ourselves to exterminate all kings, emperors, and rulers, ministers of war, generals—but first of all the financiers who lend money that makes war possible. We are going to make another war impossible!\"\n\n\"And your plan?\" prompted Kennedy, in the most matter-of-fact manner. \"How-were you to—reach the baron?\"\n\n\"We had a drawing,\" she answered, with amazing calmness. \"Another woman and I were chosen. We knew the baron's weakness for a pretty face. We planned to lure him on.\"\n\nHer voice trailed off as if, the first burst of confidence over, she felt something that would lock her secret tighter in her breast.\n\nA moment later she resumed, now talking rapidly, disconnectedly.\n\n\"You don't know, Professor Kennedy,\" she now explained, \"but there are similar groups to ours in European countries, and the plan is to strike terror and consternation everywhere in the world at once. Why, at our headquarters here, have been drawn up plans and agreements with other groups, and there are set down the time, place, and manner of all the—the removals.\"\n\nMomentarily she seemed to be carried away by something like the fanaticism of the fervor which had at first captured her— even still held her.\n\n\"Oh, can't you understand?\" she went on, as if to justify herself. \"The increase in armies, the frightful implements of slaughter, the total failure of the peace propaganda—they have all defied civilization!\n\n\"And then, too, the old, red-blooded emotions of battle have all been eliminated by the mechanical conditions of modern warfare, in which men and women are just so many units, automata.. Don't you see? To fight war with its own weapons—that has become the only, the last resort.\"\n\nHer eager, flushed face betrayed the enthusiasm which had once carried her into \"The Group,\" as she called it. I wondered what had brought her now to us.\n\n\"We are no longer making war against man!\" she cried. \"We are making war against picric acid and electric wires!\"\n\nI could not help thinking that there was no doubt, that to a certain type of mind, such reasoning might appeal most strongly.\n\n\"And you would do it in war-time, too?\" asked Kennedy quickly.\n\nShe was ready with an answer. \"King George of Greece was killed at the head of his troops. Remember Nazim Pasha, too. Such people are easily reached in time of peace—and in time of war, also—by sympathizers on their own side. That's it, you see—we have followers of all nationalities.\" She stopped, her burst of enthusiasm spent. A moment later she leaned forward, her clean-cut profile showing her more earnest than before.\n\n\"But, oh, Professor Kennedy,\" she added, \"it is working itself out to be more terrible than war itself!\"\n\n\"Have any of the plans been carried out yet?\" asked Craig, I thought a little superciliously.\n\nShe seemed to catch her breath.\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured, then checked herself. \"That is, I—I think so.\"\n\nI wondered if she were concealing something, perhaps had already had a hand in some such enterprise, and was frightened.\n\nKennedy leaned forward, observing the girl's discomfiture. \"Miss Lowe,\" he said, catching her eye and holding it almost hypnotically, \"why have you come here?\"\n\nThe question, pointblank, seemed to startle her. Evidently she had thought to tell only as little as necessary, and in her own way. But Kennedy's eyes conquered.\n\n\"Oh, can't you understand yet?\" she exclaimed, rising passionately and throwing out her arms in appeal. \"I was carried away with my hatred of war. I hate it. But now—the sudden realization of what this compact all means has—well, caused something in me to—to snap. I don't care what oath I have taken. Oh, you—you must save him!\"\n\nWhat did she mean? At first she had come to be saved herself.\n\n\"You must save him!\" she implored.\n\nOur door buzzer sounded.\n\nShe gazed about with a hunted look, as if she felt that some one had, even now, pursued her and found her out.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Quick—in here. No one will know,\" urged Kennedy, opening the door to his room. He paused for an instant. \"Tell me—have you and this other woman met the baron yet? How far has it gone?\"\n\nThe look she gave him was peculiar. I could not fathom what was going on in her mind. But she did not hesitate.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied; \"I—we have met him. He is to come back to New York from Washington to-day—this afternoon—to arrange a private loan of five million dollars secretly with some bankers We were to see him, to-night—a quiet dinner, after an automobile ride up the Hudson—\"\n\n\"Both of you?\" interrupted Craig.\n\n\"Yes—that—that other woman and my-self,\" she repeated. \"To-night was the time fixed in the drawing for the—\"\n\nThe word stuck in her throat. Kennedy understood. \"Yes, yes,\" he encouraged; \"but who is the other woman?\"\n\nBefore she could reply, the buzzer had sounded again, and she had retreated from the door. Quickly Kennedy closed it and opened the outside door. It was our old friend Burke, of the secret service.\n\nWithout a word of greeting, a hasty glance seemed to assure him that Craig and I were alone.\n\n\"Kennedy,\" he blurted out, in a tone of suppressed excitement, \"can I trust you to keep a big secret?\"\n\nCraig looked at him reproachfully, but said nothing.\n\n\"I beg your pardon—a thousand times,\" hastened Burke. \"I was so excited.\"\n\n\"Once is enough, Burke,\" laughed Kennedy, his good nature restored at Burke's crestfallen appearance.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" went on the secret-service man, \"this thing is so very important that, well, I forgot.\"\n\nHe sat down and hitched his chair close to us.\n\n\"Kennedy,\" he whispered, \"I'm on the trail, I think, of something growing out of these terrible conditions in Europe that will tax the best in the secret service. Think of it, man. There's an organization, right here in this city, a sort of assassins' club, as it were, aimed at all the powerful men the world over. Why, the most refined and intellectual reformers have joined with the most red-handed anarchists and—\"\n\n\"Sh, not so loud!\" cautioned Craig. \"I think I have one of them in the next room. Have they done anything yet to the baron?\"\n\nIt was Burke's turn, now, to look from one to the other of us in unfeigned surprise.\n\n\"The baron?\" he repeated, lowering his voice. \"What baron?\"\n\nIt was evident that Burke knew nothing, at least of this new plot. Kennedy beckoned him over to the window furthest from the door to his own room.\n\n\"What have you discovered?\" he asked, forestalling Burke in the questioning. \"What has happened?\"\n\n\"You haven't heard, then?\"\n\nKennedy nodded negatively.\n\n\"Fortescue, the American inventor of fortescite, the new explosive, died very strangely this morning.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" encouraged Kennedy.\n\n\"Most incomprehensible, too,\" Burke pursued. \"No cause, apparently. But it might have been overlooked, perhaps, except for one thing: It wasn't known generally, but Fortescue had just perfected a successful electromagnetic gun—powderless, smokeless, flashless, noiseless, and of tremendous power. To- morrow he was to have signed the contract to sell it to England. This morning he is found dead, and the final plans of the gun are gone!\"\n\nKennedy and Burke were standing mutely looking at each other.\n\n\"Who is in the next room?\" whispered Burke, hoarsely, recollecting Kennedy's caution of silence.\n\nKennedy did not reply immediately. He was evidently much excited by Burke's news of the wonderful electromagnetic gun.\n\n\"Burke,\" he exclaimed suddenly, \"let's join forces. I think we are both on the trail of a world-wide conspiracy—a sort of murder syndicate to wipe out war!\"\n\nBurke's only reply was a low whistle, which involuntarily escaped him as he reached over and grasped Craig's hand, which, to him, represented the sealing of the compact. Hastily Craig gave a whispered account of our strange visit from Miss Lowe, while Burke listened, open-mouthed.\n\nHe had scarcely finished when he reached for the telephone and called for Long Distance.\n\n\"Is this the German embassy?\" asked Craig, a few moments later, when he got his number. \"This is Craig Kennedy, in New York. The United States secret service will vouch for me—mention to them Mr. Burke of their New York office, who is here with me now. I understand that Baron Krieger is leaving for New York to meet some bankers this afternoon. He must not do so. What? He left last night at midnight and is already here?\"\n\nKennedy turned to us blankly.\n\nThe door to his room opened suddenly.\n\nThere stood Miss Lowe, gazing wild-eyed at us. She had heard what we were saying. I tried to read her face. It was not fear that I saw there. It was rage; it was jealousy.\n\n\"The traitress—it is Marie!\" she shrieked. \"She has made a secret appointment with him.\"\n\nAt last I saw the truth. Paula Lowe had fallen in love with the man she had sworn to kill!\n\n\"What shall we do?\" demanded Burke, instantly taking in the dangerous situation.\n\n\"Call O'Connor,\" I suggested, thinking of the police bureau of missing persons, and reaching for the telephone.\n\n\"No, no!\" almost shouted Craig, seizing my arm. \"The police will inevitably spoil it all. No; we must play a lone hand in this, if we are to work it out. How was Fortescue discovered, Burke?\"\n\n\"Sitting in a chair in his laboratory. He must have been there all night. There wasn't a mark on him, not a sign of violence, yet his face was terribly drawn, as though he were gasping for breath or his heart had suddenly failed him. So far, I believe, the coroner has no clue and isn't advertising the case.\"\n\n\"Take me there, then,\" decided Craig quickly. \"Walter, I must trust Miss Lowe to you on the journey. We must all go. That must be our starting-point.\"\n\nI caught his significant look to me and interpreted it to mean that he wanted me to watch Miss Lowe especially. I gathered that taking her was in the nature of a \"third degree,\" and, as a result, he expected to derive some information from her. Her face was pale and drawn as we four piled into a taxi-cab for a quick run down-town to Fortescue's laboratory.\n\n\"What do you know of these anarchists?\" asked Kennedy of Burke, as we sped along. \"Why do you suspect them?\"\n\nIt was evident that he was discussing the case so that Paula could overhear.\n\n\"Why, we received a tip from abroad—I won't say where,\" replied Burke guardedly, taking his cue. \"They call themselves 'The Group.' It seems they are composed of terrorists of all nations.\"\n\n\"The leader?\" inquired Kennedy.\n\n\"There is one, I believe, a little florid, stout German. I think he, is a paranoiac who believes there has fallen on himself a divine mission to end all warfare. Quite likely he is one of those who have fled to America to avoid military service. Perhaps—why certainly, you must know him—Annenberg, an instructor in economics at the university?\"\n\nCraig nodded and raised his eyebrows in mild surprise. We had indeed heard of Annenberg and some of his radical theories, which had sometimes quite alarmed the conservative faculty.\n\n\"How about Mrs. Annenberg?\" Craig asked, recalling the clever young wife of the middle-aged professor.\n\nAt the mere mention of the name, I felt a sort of start from Miss Lowe, who was seated next to me in the taxi-cab. She had quickly recovered herself, but not before I saw that Kennedy's plan of breaking down the last barrier of her reserve was working.\n\n\"She is one of them, too,\" Burke nodded. \"J have had my men out shadowing them and their friends. They tell me that the Annenbergs hold salons—I suppose you would call them that—attended by numbers of men and women of high social and intellectual position who dabble in radicalism and all sorts of things.\"\n\n\"Who are the other leaders?\" asked Craig. \"Have you any idea?\"\n\n\"Some idea,\" returned Burke. \"There seems to be a Frenchman, a tall, wiry man of forty-five or fifty, with a black mustache which once had a military twist. There are a couple of Englishmen. Then there are five or six Americans who seem to be active. One, I believe, is a young woman.\"\n\nKennedy checked him with a covert glance, but did not betray by a movement of a muscle to Miss Lowe that either he or Burke suspected her.\n\n\"There are three Russians,\" continued Burke, \"all of whom have escaped from Siberia. Then there is at least one Austrian, a Spaniard from the Ferrer school, and Tommaso and Enrico, two Italians. These in the main, I think, compose what might be called 'the inner circle' of 'The Group.'\"\n\nIt was indeed an alarming, terrifying revelation, as we began to realize that Miss Lowe had undoubtedly been telling the truth. Not alone was there this American group, evidently, but all over Europe the lines of the conspiracy had apparently spread. It was not a casual gathering of ordinary malcontents. It went deeper than that. It included many who, in their disgust at war, secretly were not unwilling to wink at violence to end the curse.\n\nThe big facts to us, just at present, were that this group had made America its headquarters, that plans had been studiously matured and even reduced to writing, if Paula were to be believed. Everything had been carefully staged for a great, simultaneous blow or series of blows.\n\nAs I watched, I could not escape observing that Miss Lowe looked at Burke furtively now, as though he had some uncanny power.\n\nFortescue's laboratory was in an old building on a side street several blocks from the main thoroughfares of Manhattan. He had evidently chosen it partly because of its very inaccessibility.\n\n\"If he had any visitors last night,\" commented Kennedy, when our cab at last pulled up before the place, \"they might have come and gone unnoticed.\"\n\nWe entered. Nothing had been disturbed in the laboratory by the coroner, and Kennedy was able rapidly to gain a complete idea of the case.\n\nFortescue's body, it seemed, had been discovered sprawled out in a big armchair, as Burke had said, by one of his assistants only a few hours before, when he had come to the laboratory in the morning to open it. Evidently the body of the inventor had been there undisturbed all night.\n\nAs we gleaned the meager facts, it became more evident that whoever had perpetrated the crime must have had the diabolical cunning to do it in some ordinary way that aroused no suspicion on the part of the victim, for there was no sign of any violence anywhere.\n\nFortescue's body had been removed from the chair in which it had been found and lay on a couch at the other end of the room, covered merely by a sheet. Otherwise, everything was undisturbed.\n\nKennedy pulled back a corner of the sheet, disclosing the face, contorted, and of a peculiar purplish hue from the congested blood-vessels. He bent over, and I did so, too. There was an unmistakable odor of tobacco from the body. A moment Kennedy studied the face before us, then slowly replaced the sheet.\n\nMiss Lowe had paused just inside the door and seemed resolutely bound not to look at anything. Kennedy, meanwhile, had begun a most minute search of the laboratory.\n\nIn my effort to glean what I could from her actions and expressions, I did not notice that Craig had dropped to his knees and was peering into the shadow under the laboratory table. When at last he rose and straightened himself up, however, I saw that he was holding in the palm of his hand a half-smoked, gold-tipped cigarette, which had evidently fallen on the floor beneath the table, where it had burned itself out.\n\nAn instant afterward he picked out from the pile of articles found in Fortescue's pockets and lying on another table a silver cigarette-case. He snapped it open. Fortescue's cigarettes, of which there were perhaps a half-dozen in the case, were cork- tipped. Some one had evidently visited him the night before and had apparently offered him a cigarette, for there were any number of the cork-tipped stubs lying about. Who was it? I caught Paula looking with fascinated gaze at the gold-tipped stub, as Kennedy carefully folded it up in a piece of paper and deposited it in his pocket. Did she know something about the case?\n\nWithout a word, Kennedy seemed to take in the scant furniture of the laboratory at a glance, and a quick step or two brought him before a steel filing-cabinet. One drawer projected a bit. On its face was a little typewritten card bearing the inscription: E-M GUN.\n\nHe pulled the drawer open and glanced over the data in it.\n\n\"Just what is an electromagnetic gun?\" I asked, interpreting the initials on the drawer.\n\n\"Well,\" he explained, as he turned over the notes and sketches, \"the primary principle involved in the construction of such a gun consists in impelling the projectile by the magnetic action of a solenoid, the sectional coils or helices of which are supplied with current through devices actuated by the projectile itself. In other words, the sections of helices of the solenoid produce an accelerated motion of the projectile by acting successively on it, after a principle involved in the construction of electromagnetic rock-drills and despatch- tubes.\n\n\"All projectiles used in this gun of Fortescue's evidently must have magnetic properties and projectiles of iron or containing large portions of iron. You see, many coils are wound around the barrel of the gun. As the projectile starts, it does so under the attraction of those coils ahead, which the current makes temporary magnets. It automatically cuts off the current from those coils that it passes, allowing those further on only to attract it, and preventing those behind from pulling it back.\"\n\nHe paused to study the scraps of plans. \"Fortescue had evidently also worked out a way of changing the poles of the coils as the projectile passed, causing them to repel the projectile, which must have added to its velocity.\"\n\nHe continued turning over the prints and notes in the drawer. When he finished, he looked up at us with an expression that indicated that he had merely satisfied himself of something he had already suspected.\n\n\"You were right, Burke,\" he said; \"the final plans are gone.\"\n\nBurke who, in the meantime, had been telephoning about the city in a vain effort to locate Baron Krieger, both at such banking-offices in Wall Street as he might be likely to visit and at some of the hotels most frequented by foreigners, merely nodded. He was evidently at a loss completely how to proceed.\n\nIn fact, there seemed to be innumerable problems—to warn Baron Krieger, to get the list of the assassinations, to guard Miss Lowe against falling into the hands of her anarchist friends again, to find the murderer of Fortescue, to prevent the use of the electromagnetic gun, and, if possible, to seize the anarchists before they had a chance to carry their plans further.\n\n\"There is nothing more that we can do here,\" remarked Craig briskly, betraying no sign of hesitation. \"I think the best thing we can do is to go to my own laboratory. There, at least, there is something I must investigate sooner or later.\"\n\nNo one offering either a suggestion or an objection, we four again entered our cab. It was quite noticeable, now, that the visit had shaken Paula Lowe, but Kennedy still studiously refrained from questioning her, trusting that what she had seen and heard would have its effect.\n\nLike everyone visiting Craig's laboratory for the first time, Miss Lowe seemed to feel the spell of the innumerable strange and uncanny instruments which he had gathered about him in his scientific warfare against crime. I could see that she was becoming more and more nervous, perhaps fearing, even, that, in some incomprehensible way, he might read her own thoughts. Yet one thing I did not detect: she showed no disposition to turn back on the course on which she had entered by coming to us.\n\nKennedy was quickly and deftly testing the stub of the little thin, gold-tipped cigarette. \"Excessive smoking,\" he remarked casually, \"causes neuroses of the heart, and tobacco has a specific affinity for the coronary arteries as well as a tremendous effect on the vagus nerve. But I don't think this was any ordinary smoke.\"\n\nHe had finished his tests, and a quiet smile of satisfaction flitted momentarily over his face.\n\nAs he looked up he remarked to us, with his eyes fixed on Miss Lowe: \"That was a lady's cigarette. Did you notice the size? There has been a woman in this case.\"\n\nThe girl, suddenly transformed by the rapid-fire succession of discoveries, stood before us like a specter.\n\n\"'The Group,' as anarchists call it,\" pursued Craig, \"is the loosest sort of organization conceivable, I believe, with no set membership, no officers, no laws—just a place of meeting. Could you get us into the inner circle, Miss Lowe?\"\n\nHer only answer was a little suppressed scream. Kennedy had asked the question merely for its effect, for it was only too evident that there was no time for us to play the stool- pigeon.\n\nKennedy, who had been clearing up the materials he had used in the analysis of the cigarette, wheeled about suddenly.\n\n\"Where is the headquarters of the inner circle?\" he shot out.\n\nMiss Lowe hesitated.\n\n\"Tell me,\" insisted Kennedy; \"you must!\"\n\nIf it had been Burke's bulldozing, she would never have yielded. But as she looked into Kennedy's eyes, she read there that he had long since fathomed the secret of her wildly beating heart, that if she would accomplish the purpose of saving the baron, she must stop at nothing.\n\n\"At—Maplehurst,\" she answered, in a low tone, dropping her eyes from his penetrating gaze, \"Professor Annenberg's home—out on Long Island.\"\n\n\"We must act swiftly if we are to succeed,\" considered Kennedy, his tone betraying rather sympathy with than triumph over the wretched girl who had, at last, cast everything in the balance to outweigh the terrible situation into which she had been drawn. \"To send Miss Lowe for that fatal list of assassinations is to send her either back into the power of this murderous group or perhaps to involve her again in the completion of their plans.\"\n\nShe sank back into a chair in complete nervous and physical collapse at the realization that in her new-found passion to save the baron, she had bared her sensitive soul for the dissection of three men whom she had never seen before.\n\n\"We must have that list,\" pursued Kennedy decisively. \"We must visit Annenberg's headquarters.\"\n\n\"And I?\" she asked, trembling, now, with genuine fear at the thought that he might ask her to accompany us, as he had on our visit to Fortescue's laboratory.\n\n\"Miss Lowe,\" said Kennedy, bending over her, \"you have gone too far, now, ever to turn back. You are not equal to the trip. Would you like to remain here? No one will suspect. Here, at least, you will be safe until we return.\"\n\nHer answer was a mute expression of thanks and confidence.\n\nQuickly now Craig completed his arrangements for the visit to the headquarters of the real anarchist leader. Burke telephoned for a high-powered car, while Miss Lowe told frankly of the habits of Annenberg and the chances of finding his place unguarded, which were good in the daytime. Kennedy's only equipment for the excursion consisted in a small package which he took from a cabinet at the end of the room, and, with a parting reassurance to Paula Lowe, we were soon speeding over the bridge to the borough across the river.\n\nOur quest took us to a rather dilapidated old house on the outskirts of the little Long Island town. The house stood alone, not far from the tracks of a trolley that ran at infrequent intervals, and even a hasty reconnoitering showed that to stop our motor at even a reasonable distance from it was in itself to arouse suspicion.\n\nAlthough the house seemed deserted, Craig took no chances, but directed the car to turn at the next cross-road and then run back along a road back of and parallel to that on which Annenberg's was situated. It was perhaps a quarter of a mile away that we stopped and ran the car up along the side of the road into some bushes. Annenberg's was plainly visible, and it was not at all likely that anyone there would suspect trouble from that quarter.\n\nA hasty conference with Burke followed, in which Kennedy unwrapped his small package, leaving part of its contents with him and adding careful instructions.\n\nThen Kennedy and I retraced our steps back to the mysterious house.\n\nTo all appearance there had been no need of such excessive caution. Not a sound or motion greeted us as we entered the gate and made our way around to the rear. The very isolation of the house was now our protection, for we had no inquisitive neighbors to watch us for the instant when Kennedy, with the dexterity of a yeggman, inserted his knife between the sashes of the kitchen window and turned the catch.\n\nWe made our way on cautious tiptoe through a dining-room to a living-room, and, finding nothing, proceeded up-stairs. There was nothing to indicate that it was different from most small suburban homes, until, at last, we mounted to the attic.\n\nThis was finished off as one large room across the back of the house and two in front. As we opened the door to the large room, we could only gaze about in surprise. This was the rendezvous, the arsenal, literary, explosive, and toxicological of, \"The Group.\" Ranged on a table were all the materials for bomb making, while in a cabinet I fancied there were poisons enough to decimate a city.\n\nKennedy sniffed. Over all I, too, could catch the faint odor of stale tobacco. No time was to be lost, however, and while Craig set to work, rapidly going through the contents of a desk in the corner, I glanced over the contents of a drawer of a heavy Mission table.\n\n\"Here's some of Annenberg's literature,\" I remarked, coming across a small pile of manuscript, entitled \"The Human Slaughter- House.\"\n\n\"Read it,\" panted Kennedy; \"it may give a clue.\"\n\nHastily I scanned the mad, frantic indictment of war.\n\n### Quote\n\nI see wild beasts all around me, distorted unnaturally, in a life-and-death-struggle, with bloodshot eyes, with foaming, gnashing mouths. They attack and kill one another and try to mangle each other. I leap to my feet. I race out into the night and tread on quaking flesh, step on hard heads, and stumble over weapons and helmets. Something is clutching at my feet like hands, so that I race away like a hunted deer with the hounds at his heels—and ever over more bodies—breathless, out of one field into another. Horror is crooning over my head. Horror is crooning beneath my feet. And nothing but dying, mangled flesh!\n\nOf a sudden, I see nothing but blood before me. The heavens have opened, and the red blood pours in through the windows. Blood wells up on an altar. The walls run blood from the ceiling to the floor, and a giant of blood stands before me. His beard and his hair drip blood. He seats himself on the altar and laughs from thick lips. The black executioner raises his sword and whirls it above my head. Another moment, and my head will roll down on the floor. Another moment, and the red jet will spurt from my neck.\n\nMurderers! Murderers! None other than murderers!\n\nI paused in the reading. \"There's nothing here,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Craig contemplatively, \"one can at least easily understand how sensitive and imaginative people who have fallen under the influence of one who writes in that way can feel justified in killing those who bring such horrors on the human race—Hello—what's this?\"\n\nHe had discovered a false back of one of the drawers in the desk and had jimmied it open. On the top of innumerable papers lay a large linen envelop. On its face it bore in typewriting—just like the card on the drawer at Fortescue's—E-M GUN.\n\n\"It is the original envelop that contained the final plans of the electromagnetic gun,\" he explained, opening it.\n\nThe envelop was empty. What had been done with the plans?\n\nSuddenly a bell rang, startling me beyond measure. It was, however, only the telephone, of which an extension reached up into the attic arsenal. Kennedy quickly unhooked the receiver.\n\n\"Hello!\" I heard him answer. \"Yes; this is it.\"\n\nHe had disguised his voice. I waited anxiously and watched his face.\n\n\"The deuce!\" he exclaimed, with his hand over the transmitter so that his voice would not be heard at the other end of the line.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked eagerly.\n\n\"It was Mrs. Annenberg—I am sure. But she was too keen for me. She caught on. There must be some password or form of expression that they use, for she has hung up the receiver.\"\n\nKennedy waited a minute or so. Then he whistled into the transmitter. It was done apparently to see whether there was anyone listening. But there was no answer.\n\n\"Operator! Operator!\" he called insistently, moving the hook up and down. \"Yes, operator. Can you tell me what number that was which just called?\"\n\nHe waited impatiently.\n\n\"Bleecker—7180,\" he repeated, after the girl. \"Thank you. Information, please.\"\n\nAgain we waited, as Craig tried to trace the call.\n\n\"What is the street-address of Bleecker, 7180?\" he asked. \"Five hundred and one, East Fifth—a tenement. Thank you.\"\n\n\"A tenement?\" I repeated blankly.\n\n\n\nProvide a comprehensive summary (between 600 and 900 words long) of the key events, information, and important details from this document."

    "final_summary": "\"The Murder Syndicate,\" a detective story by Unknown, unfolds around an intricate web of conspiracy, assassination, and radical anarchism set against the turbulent backdrop of impending war. The narrative begins abruptly with a frantic young woman, Miss Paula Lowe, urgently seeking Professor Craig Kennedy. Upon gaining entry, she reveals herself as a member of a secret anarchist group committed to ending war by exterminating rulers, financiers, and war-makers through assassination. The group’s crusade, however, has taken a dark turn, and Paula is now desperate, proclaiming her own life is at risk unless she goes through with a planned murder of Baron Krieger—a young, influential German diplomat and financier rallying American sympathy and financial support for Germany.\n\nMiss Lowe, visibly shaken and near hysteria, explains the anarchist organization’s radical ideology: fighting war with war, employing deadly violence aimed not just at political heads but also war financiers. These assassins operate internationally and have coordinated plans for a worldwide series of removals to terrorize governments and prevent future wars. The revelation shocks Professor Kennedy and the narrator, who begin to suspect the enormity and danger of the conspiracy.\n\nPaula discloses that she and another woman, named Marie, were selected to lure the Baron to his assassination at a planned dinner and automobile ride along the Hudson. Yet, as the story progresses, a startling twist emerges: Paula confesses she has fallen in love with Baron Krieger. This passion introduces a volatile element to the plot, as Paula becomes a conflicted traitor against her own anarchist comrades, desperate to save the Baron from being killed.\n\nTheir tense conversation is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Burke, a secret service agent who is investigating alarming developments related to this secret network of assassins, which he refers to as “The Group.” Burke shares shocking news about the mysterious death of Fortescue, an American inventor famed for developing a revolutionary electromagnetic gun— a weapon that is smokeless, noiseless, and far more powerful than conventional arms. Fortescue’s sudden death in his laboratory was inexplicable; he was found lifeless but with no signs of violence, and crucially, the plans for his electromagnetic gun are missing. Given the weapon’s potential to alter the nature of warfare drastically, its disappearance is alarming.\n\nThe intersecting investigations of Professor Kennedy and Burke suggest they are confronting a vast, world-spanning syndicate—“The Murder Syndicate”—composed of intellectuals, social reformers, anarchists, and radicals united by their extremist opposition to war. Among its inner circle are diverse nationalities: Germans including a key figure, Professor Annenberg; his wife, said to be influential in radical circles; French, English, Americans, Russians, Austrians, Spaniards, Italians, and others, all engaged in a shadowy conspiracy. The Group holds clandestine meetings and conspires to eliminate powerful individuals who perpetuate war and conflict.\n\nThe narrative then focuses on systematic detective work as Kennedy, Burke, and the narrator accompany Paula Lowe to Fortescue’s laboratory in New York. The lab is isolated, the scene of the inventor’s death. They find Fortescue’s body positioned on a couch with no external injuries, but evidence such as a peculiar gold-tipped cigarette stub—distinct from Fortescue’s cork-tipped cigarettes—signals a female visitor’s presence and possible involvement in the crime. Kennedy’s sharp forensic intellect unravels details of the electromagnetic gun’s mechanics from blueprints found in a locked filing cabinet, confirming the final plans have been stolen, heightening the urgency of preventing the weapon’s misuse.\n\nDespite efforts, Burke’s attempts to locate Baron Krieger—through banks and hotels—prove futile. Suspicion grows that the anarchists have already set their murderous plot in motion. Miss Lowe’s jealousy toward Marie, the co-assassin who arranged a clandestine meeting with the Baron, adds emotional volatility to the situation, complicating their chances of averting disaster.\n\nDetermined to uncover the heart of the conspiracy, Kennedy presses Paula to identify The Group’s headquarters. She reluctantly reveals it to be at the home of Professor Annenberg on Long Island. Travel to this isolated, run-down house reveals the grim truth behind the intellectual radicals’ facade: the attic serves as the central arsenal and office for the anarchists, containing bomb-making materials, toxic substances, and mountains of incendiary literature advocating war’s violent abolition. The atmosphere is charged with menace, as the weapons of terror and ideological zeal combine.\n\nKennedy, posing carefully to avoid alerting the conspirators, searches through the premises. Among the fiery anti-war tracts titled “The Human Slaughter-House,” he discovers a secret compartment concealing an envelope marked “E-M GUN,” once again empty, confirming the electromagnetic gun plans are hidden or already removed.\n\nBefore they can investigate further, Kennedy receives a telephone call—likely from Mrs. Annenberg—who cunningly cuts off communication before revealing any information. Tracing the call leads to a tenement address in East Fifth Street, New York, suggesting the syndicate’s reach extends covertly into urban hideouts, layering the mystery.\n\nThroughout these events, the tension mounts. The alliance of Kennedy, Burke, and the narrator symbolizes the forces of law and reason seeking to thwart an ominous, well-organized conspiracy that threatens global instability through targeted murders and theft of dangerous technologies. Paula Lowe’s inner turmoil, torn between revolutionary fanaticism and newfound love, epitomizes the story’s emotional stakes and the personal cost of radicalism.\n\nIn summary, \"The Murder Syndicate\" is a complex detective thriller that intertwines themes of political extremism, the horrors of war, and technological innovation with a suspenseful investigation of anarchist plots. It portrays a secret international cabal dedicated to terrorism as a misguided means to peace, using assassination as a weapon to eradicate war-makers. With the mysterious death of a brilliant inventor, the theft of a groundbreaking electromagnetic weapon, and the endangered life of a prominent German diplomat, the story delves deep into the shadowy world of espionage, ideological conflict, and the high stakes of futuristic armaments. The protagonists’ race against time to unravel the conspiracy, protect innocent lives, and prevent a catastrophic chain of violence encapsulates a tangled narrative of intrigue, moral ambiguity, and desperate courage.",
    "reference": "Paula Lowe bursts into Kennedy’s apartment with a terrible secret: she is a member of an anarchist group that aims to prevent war by assassinating financiers and heads of state. But they have now asked her to do the impossible: kill Baron Krieger, the man she loves."
