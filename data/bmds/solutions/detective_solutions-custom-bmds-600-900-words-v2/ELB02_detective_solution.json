    "full_text": "\"The Murder at Troyte's Hill\" unfolds as a complex detective story centered around the mysterious death of Alexander \"old Sandy\" Henderson, the lodge-keeper at Troyte's Hill, a deteriorating estate in Cumberland. The investigation is jointly handled by Griffiths of the Newcastle Constabulary—characterized as a keen and methodical detective—and the sharp-witted Miss Loveday Brooke, who is brought in as an amanuensis and unofficial assistant to delve deeper into the nuances of the case.\n\nThe narrative begins with Mr. Dyer briefing Miss Brooke on the case details. Old Sandy, a solitary lodge-keeper living alone in a two-room lodge at the estate, was found dead on the morning of September 6th. His death was discovered by local children who noticed his bedroom window wide open and his body lying on the floor in his nightshirt, evidently having fallen backward from the window. The cause of death was a heavy blow to the temple, likely from a fist or a blunt object. The crime scene was chaotic—furniture overturned, bedclothes stuffed into the chimney, a clock placed upside-down, and ornaments lined up as if “walking” toward the door. Despite this disarray, the cupboard where Sandy kept his savings was untouched, suggesting robbery was not the motive.\n\nThe inquest returned a verdict of willful murder by an unknown assailant. Public speculation leaned toward the possibility of a crazed lunatic or an escaped asylum inmate, but Detective Griffiths harbored strong suspicions against the lord of the estate’s family, especially young Mr. Harry Craven.\n\nThe Craven family dynamic is crucial. Mr. Craven senior, a scholarly, somewhat reclusive philologist focused on an extensive work on comparative philology, inherited the estate after his brother’s death but struggled to maintain the household and funded his children’s education sparingly. The family consisted of Mr. Craven, his wife (a quiet woman with a missionary background), their daughter Nina, and their son Harry—a wayward young man described as a gentleman-blackleg and morally dubious character. Harry’s health was suspiciously poor; he was absent from the inquest on a doctor’s certificate for typhoid fever, though Griffiths suspected the illness may be feigned.\n\nTensions between old Sandy and young Harry were notable. Griffiths explained that since the Craven family took possession of Troyte’s Hill, Harry had openly defied Sandy’s authority, culminating in a violent confrontation the day before the murder—a scene witnessed by several people where Harry threatened Sandy’s life. In contrast, the butler, John Hales, was regarded as respectable and above suspicion despite his obvious disdain for Sandy, who had earned the servants’ dislike by wielding disproportionate influence over their master and disturbing the household hierarchy—his salary was so high it had caused the butler’s wages to be cut.\n\nGriffiths’ theory suggested Harry murdered Sandy in cold blood. Harry was known to have left the house briefly on the night of the murder, around 10 pm, coinciding with the medical evidence that placed Sandy’s death between 10 and 11 pm. No one could account for his whereabouts until later that night, and it was suspicious that Harry returned to the house reportedly carrying a valuable piece of silverware, which he pawned at a low-class inn for cash. The local police were pursuing the matter, preparing to arrest Harry.\n\nMiss Brooke is introduced into the household under the guise of helping Mr. Craven with his philological work at a very modest salary, facilitating her discreet investigation. On arriving at Troyte’s Hill, she observes the rundown condition of the property, illustrating the Cravens’ financial struggles. She meets John Hales and the cook, who reluctantly accommodate her. Loveday also visits Sandy’s lodge, confirming its graveled surroundings and disuse, and stumbles upon the dead body of Captain, the Cravens’ black retriever, hidden among shrubbery and similarly struck dead by a blunt instrument, paralleling Sandy’s violent end.\n\nInside the house, Loveday meets Mr. Craven senior, who is a handsome but emotionally fragile man, often lost in thought and overwhelmed by the magnitude of his scholarly labors. His demeanor oscillates between energetic bursts and long periods of collapse into a trance-like state. He shows some interest in Loveday’s work but struggles to articulate his thoughts, demanding perfect quiet to compose his treatise. His distracted behavior contrasts strikingly with the underlying tension of the ongoing murder case.\n\nWhile Loveday attempts to settle into the role of amanuensis, she investigates the household discreetly. She uncovers that the butler, Hales, owed Sandy nearly a hundred pounds, a fact that adds another layer of complexity to household relations and potential motives. Loveday’s communication with Griffiths is crucial; she sends him updates through a trustworthy post-boy, and their correspondence reveals further leads and suspicions.\n\nGriffiths’ diligence pays off when he discovers that Harry Craven’s illness is likely a sham. The attending doctor, Waters, admits he saw Harry only once and issued his certificate based solely on Mrs. Craven’s word. Mrs. Craven, experienced in medical care from her missionary work in Natal, insisted she could manage Harry’s care alone, which allowed them to avoid closer medical scrutiny. Meanwhile, several household servants fled out of fear of contagion, and Nina Craven was sent away with a maid to Newcastle.\n\nFurthermore, on the night of the murder, Harry was seen pawning a valuable silver epergne for money at an inn. McQueen, the innkeeper, later approaches Griffiths, fearful of legal repercussions for his unwitting involvement as a receiver of stolen goods. This transaction places Harry near financial desperation and contributes to the mounting suspicion.\n\nThe climax of the narrative excerpt is Griffiths’ arrival at Troyte’s Hill with constables to arrest Harry. This unfolds without Harry or his family’s awareness; the household is starkly divided, with Mrs. Craven and Nina isolated due to the supposed fever and the rest seemingly unprepared for the abrupt turn of events.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nI began by listing everything that is really known and everything that is only assumed.\n\nKNOWN  \n•\tOld Sandy’s savings were **not** touched – the object of the visit was not robbery.  \n•\tThe dogs’ body was carried away and hidden – the killer wanted the animal’s death NOT to be discovered at once.  \n•\tThe room was put into grotesque disorder after Sandy had fallen – someone tried hard to give the impression that a lunatic or an “escaped madman” had broken in.  \n•\tThe fatal blow could have been struck from outside while Sandy was leaning out of the low window; he then fell back into the room.  \n•\tJohn Hales, the butler, owed Sandy almost £100 and hated him for it.  \n•\tHarry Craven certainly left the house that night, but the only thing proved about him is that he went to an inn to pawn a piece of silver at about 10.20 p.m.  \n•\tThe whole “typhoid-fever” business rests on Mrs Craven’s word; the doctor scarcely examined Harry.  \n•\tCaptain, the retriever, was an affectionate house-dog.  He would not bark at, still less attack, members of the household whom he knew, but he WOULD fly at anyone who raised a hand against his master’s friend Sandy.  \n•\tOld Sandy was obstinate; if he had been threatened with violence he would have opened his window and tried to “have it out” from behind the security of the bars – exactly the position in which he was found.  \n\nNEXT I examined MOTIVE\n\n•\tHarry Craven – violent quarrel the previous day, needs money, generally worthless; but killing Sandy would not give him a penny and would only invite discovery.  \n•\tMr Craven – no motive whatever; Sandy was his protégé.  \n•\tMrs Craven – ditto, and physically improbable.  \n•\tNina – none.  \n•\t“Lunatic” – no trace.  \n•\tJohn Hales – a pressing, concrete motive: wipe out a creditor who could ruin him, and at the same time shift suspicion to the detested “young master.”\n\nOPPORTUNITY & ALIBI\n\n•\tHarry is absent between 10 p.m. and 10.20 p.m. – just long enough to reach the village inn (two miles; proved by ostler) but NOT long enough to reach the lodge (in the opposite direction), kill Sandy, stage a scene, hide the dog, wash, and then tramp off to the inn.  \n•\tJohn Hales is the only servant whose movements are NOT accounted for: no-one is likely to wonder if the butler is out of the pantry for half an hour.  He knows every path in the shrubbery, and he keeps his own heavy oak walking-stick in the plate pantry.  \n\nPHYSICAL CLUES THAT POINT TO HALES\n\n1\tThe retriever’s head wound exactly fits the knob of that oak stick.  Miss Brooke finds black dog-hairs and dried blood in the carving of the knob, imperfectly cleaned off.  \n2\tGravel from the unused path outside the lodge is found embedded in the rubber ferrule of the same stick.  \n3\tSmall splashes of the retriever’s blood on the inside of Hales’s cuff were badly sponged but show up under the magnifying glass Miss Brooke habitually carries.  \n4\tHales’ plated buttons were newly put on next morning: he had torn one of the old ones off in the struggle with the dog; Brooke finds the missing button under the lodge window.  \n\nLOGICAL DEDUCTION\n\nOnly a person who (a) needed Sandy out of the way, (b) was cool enough to “dress” the crime scene, (c) was prepared to kill the dog, and (d) could afterwards try to steer suspicion towards Harry, fits all the facts.  \nThat person is the butler, John Hales.  \nHarry’s bogus illness is simply Mrs Craven’s attempt to shield her scape-grace son from arrest for the pawned silver, NOT a proof of Harry’s guilt in the murder.\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nHarry Craven, John Hales, Mr. R. Craven (senior), Mrs. Lydia Craven, Nina Craven, Dr. Waters, Unknown “escaped lunatic”\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJohn Hales\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAbout 9.45 p.m. on 5 September John Hales slipped out of the back premises carrying his heavy oak walking-stick.  \nCaptain, the Cravens’ retriever, trotted after the man he knew.  Hales intended to confront Sandy about the £100 he owed and to force him either to destroy or hand over the IOU.  \nSandy, hearing footsteps on the gravel, flung up his bedroom window and leaned out.  The discussion turned into a furious quarrel; Sandy flatly refused to give up the promissory note.  \nAt that moment Captain, alarmed by the angry voices, tried to defend Sandy.  Hales, panicking, struck the dog a smashing blow with the stick, killing him instantly.  To avoid immediate discovery he dragged the body into the shrubbery.  \nSandy, horrified, started to climb out of the window.  Hales followed him, struck again through the bars of the window, and Sandy pitched backward into the room, his temple fracturing on the iron frame of a chair as he fell.  \nRealising what he had done, the butler clambered in through the window, ransacked the place, up-ended furniture, stuffed the bed-clothes up the chimney, and lined the china ornaments in a grotesque “march” towards the door – everything calculated to make the affair look like the work of a maniac.  \nHe then locked the outer door behind him, returned to the house by a circuitous path, washed the stick and his cuffs, changed his coat-buttons, and re-appeared in the pantry.  No one had noticed his absence.  \nNext morning gossip about Harry’s violent scene with Sandy convinced Hales that suspicion would fall quite naturally on the young master.  He therefore said nothing and waited — until Miss Loveday Brooke found the retriever’s body and the incriminating traces on his stick and clothing.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nHarry Craven – absent from the estate between 10 p.m. and 10.20 p.m. in the opposite direction; no blood, no gravel, no dog-hairs on him.  His only crime was pawning the epergne.  \nMr. Craven – physically weak, absorbed in his philology; no motive whatever.  \nMrs. Craven – equally without motive; her “typhoid” deception was maternal panic, not complicity in murder.  \nNina Craven – away in Newcastle at the time.  \nDr. Waters – saw Harry only once; involved only by issuing a careless certificate.  \n“Escaped lunatic” – pure newspaper fancy; no asylum within fifty miles reports a missing inmate.  \nThus every fact left unexplained by the other theories is exactly explained once John Hales, the indebted butler, is placed at the scene.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "text": "\"GRIFFITHS, of the Newcastle Constabulary, has the case in hand,\" said Mr. Dyer; \"those Newcastle men are keen-witted, shrewd fellows, and very jealous of outside interference. They only sent to me under protest, as it were, because they wanted your sharp wits at work inside the house.\"\n\"I suppose throughout I am to work with Griffiths, not with you?\" said Miss Brooke.\n\"Yes; when I have given you in outline the facts of the case, I simply have nothing more to do with it, and you must depend on Griffiths for any assistance of any sort that you may require.\"\nHere, with a swing, Mr. Dyer opened his big ledger and turned rapidly over its leaves till he came to the heading \"Troyte's Hill\" and the date \"September 6th.\"\n\"I'm all attention,\" said Loveday, leaning back in her chair in the attitude of a listener.\n\"The murdered man,\" resumed Mr. Dyer, \"is a certain Alexander Henderson–usually known as old Sandy–lodge-keeper to Mr. Craven, of Troyte's Hill, Cumberland. The lodge consists merely of two rooms on the ground floor, a bedroom and a sitting-room; these Sandy occupied alone, having neither kith nor kin of any degree. On the morning of September 6th, some children going up to the house with milk from the farm, noticed that Sandy's bed-room window stood wide open. Curiosity prompted them to peep in; and then, to their horror, they saw old Sandy, in his night-shirt, lying dead on the floor, as if he had fallen backwards from the window. They raised an alarm; and on examination, it was found that death had ensued from a heavy blow on the temple, given either by a strong fist or some blunt instrument. The room, on being entered, presented a curious appearance. It was as if a herd of monkeys had been turned into it and allowed to work their impish will. Not an article of furniture remained in its place: the bed-clothes had been rolled into a bundle and stuffed into the chimney; the bedstead–a small iron one–lay on its side; the one chair in the room stood on the top of the table; fender and fire-irons lay across the washstand, whose basin was to be found in a farther corner, holding bolster and pillow. The clock stood on its head in the middle of the mantelpiece; and the small vases and ornaments, which flanked it on either side, were walking, as it were, in a straight line towards the door. The old man's clothes had been rolled into a ball and thrown on the top of a high cupboard in which he kept his savings and whatever valuables he had. This cupboard, however, had not been meddled with, and its contents remained intact, so it was evident that robbery was not the motive for the crime. At the inquest, subsequently held, a verdict of 'willful murder' against some person or persons unknown was returned. The local police are diligently investigating the affair, but, as yet, no arrests have been made. The opinion that at present prevails in the neighbourhood is that the crime has been perpetrated by some lunatic, escaped or otherwise and enquiries are being made at the local asylums as to missing or lately released inmates. Griffiths, however, tells me that his suspicions set in another direction.\"\nImage of bearded man (old Sandy) lying on a floor, in a nightshirt.\nTHEY SAW OLD SANDY LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR.\n\"Did anything of importance transpire at the inquest?\"\n\"Nothing specially important. Mr. Craven broke down in giving his evidence when he alluded to the confidential relations that had always subsisted between Sandy and himself, and spoke of the last time that he had seen him alive. The evidence of the butler, and one or two of the female servants, seems clear enough, and they let fall something of a hint that Sandy was not altogether a favourite among them, on account of the overbearing manner in which he used his influence with his master. Young Mr. Craven, a youth of about nineteen, home from Oxford for the long vacation, was not present at the inquest; a doctor's certificate was put in stating that he was suffering from typhoid fever, and could not leave his bed without risk to his life. Now this young man is a thoroughly bad sort, and as much a gentleman-blackleg as it is possible for such a young fellow to be. It seems to Griffiths that there is something suspicious about this illness of his. He came back from Oxford on the verge of delirium tremens, pulled round from that, and then suddenly, on the day after the murder, Mrs. Craven rings the bell, announces that he has developed typhoid fever and orders a doctor to be sent for.\"\n\"What sort of man is Mr. Craven senior?\"\n\"He seems to be a quiet old fellow, a scholar and learned philologist. Neither his neighbours nor his family see much of him; he almost lives in his study, writing a treatise, in seven or eight volumes, on comparative philology. He is not a rich man. Troyte's Hill, though it carries position in the county, is not a paying property, and Mr. Craven is unable to keep it up properly. I am told he has had to cut down expenses in all directions in order to send his son to college, and his daughter from first to last has been entirely educated by her mother. Mr. Craven was originally intended for the church, but for some reason or other, when his college career came to an end, he did not present himself for ordination–went out to Natal instead, where he obtained some civil appointment and where he remained for about fifteen years. Henderson was his servant during the latter portion of his Oxford career, and must have been greatly respected by him, for although the remuneration derived from his appointment at Natal was small, he paid Sandy a regular yearly allowance out of it. When, about ten years ago, he succeeded to Troyte's Hill, on the death of his elder brother, and returned home with his family, Sandy was immediately installed as lodge-keeper, and at so high a rate of pay that the butler's wages were cut down to meet it.\"\n\"Ah, that wouldn't improve the butler's feelings towards him,\" ejaculated Loveday.\nMr. Dyer went on: \"But, in spite of his high wages, he doesn't appear to have troubled much about his duties as lodge-keeper, for they were performed, as a rule, by the gardener's boy, while he took his meals and passed his time at the house, and, speaking generally, put his finger into every pie. You know the old adage respecting the servant of twenty-one years' standing: 'Seven years my servant, seven years my equal, seven years my master.' Well, it appears to have held good in the case of Mr. Craven and Sandy. The old gentleman, absorbed in his philological studies, evidently let the reins slip through his fingers, and Sandy seems to have taken easy possession of them. The servants frequently had to go to him for orders, and he carried things, as a rule, with a high hand.\"\n\"Did Mrs. Craven never have a word to say on the matter?\"\n\"I've not heard much about her. She seems to be a quiet sort of person. She is a Scotch missionary's daughter; perhaps she spends her time working for the Cape mission and that sort of thing.\"\n\"And young Mr. Craven: did he knock under to Sandy's rule?\"\n\"Ah, now you're hitting the bull's eye and we come to Griffiths' theory. The young man and Sandy appear to have been at loggerheads ever since the Cravens took possession of Troyte's Hill. As a schoolboy Master Harry defied Sandy and threatened him with his hunting-crop; and subsequently, as a young man, has used strenuous endeavours to put the old servant in his place. On the day before the murder, Griffiths says, there was a terrible scene between the two, in which the young gentleman, in the presence of several witnesses, made use of strong language and threatened the old man's life. Now, Miss Brooke, I have told you all the circumstances of the case so far as I know them. For fuller particulars I must refer you to Griffiths. He, no doubt, will meet you at Grenfell–the nearest station to Troyte's Hill, and tell you in what capacity he has procured for you an entrance into the house. By-the-way, he has wired to me this morning that he hopes you will be able to save the Scotch express to-night.\"\nLoveday expressed her readiness to comply with Mr. Griffiths' wishes.\n\"I shall be glad,\" said Mr. Dyer, as he shook hands with her at the office door, \"to see you immediately on your return–that, however, I suppose, will not be yet awhile. This promises, I fancy, to be a longish affair?\" This was said interrogatively.\n\"I haven't the least idea on the matter,\" answered Loveday. \"I start on my work without theory of any sort–in fact, I may say, with my mind a perfect blank.\"\nAnd anyone who had caught a glimpse of her blank, expressionless features, as she said this, would have taken her at her word.\nGrenfell, the nearest post-town to Troyte's Hill, is a fairly busy, populous little town–looking south towards the black country, and northwards to low, barren hills. Pre-eminent among these stands Troyte's Hill, famed in the old days as a border keep, and possibly at a still earlier date as a Druid stronghold.\nAt a small inn at Grenfell, dignified by the title of \"The Station Hotel,\" Mr. Griffiths, of the Newcastle constabulary, met Loveday and still further initiated her into the mysteries of the Troyte's Hill murder.\n\"A little of the first excitement has subsided,\" he said, after preliminary greetings had been exchanged; \"but still the wildest rumours are flying about and repeated as solemnly as if they were Gospel truths. My chief here and my colleagues generally adhere to their first conviction, that the criminal is some suddenly crazed tramp or else an escaped lunatic, and they are confident that sooner or later we shall come upon his traces. Their theory is that Sandy, hearing some strange noise at the Park Gates, put his head out of the window to ascertain the cause and immediately had his death blow dealt him; then they suppose that the lunatic scrambled into the room through the window and exhausted his frenzy by turning things generally upside down. They refuse altogether to share my suspicions respecting young Mr. Craven.\"\nMr. Griffiths was a tall, thin-featured man, with iron-grey hair, but so close to his head that it refused to do anything but stand on end. This gave a somewhat comic expression to the upper portion of his face and clashed oddly with the melancholy look that his mouth habitually wore.\n\"I have made all smooth for you at Troyte's Hill,\" he presently went on. \"Mr. Craven is not wealthy enough to allow himself the luxury of a family lawyer, so he occasionally employs the services of Messrs. Wells and Sugden, lawyers in this place, and who, as it happens, have, off and on, done a good deal of business for me. It was through them I heard that Mr. Craven was anxious to secure the assistance of an amanuensis. I immediately offered your services, stating that you were a friend of mine, a lady of impoverished means, who would gladly undertake the duties for the munificent sum of a guinea a month, with board and lodging. The old gentleman at once jumped at the offer, and is anxious for you to be at Troyte's Hill at once.\"\nLoveday expressed her satisfaction with the programme that Mr. Griffiths had sketched for her, then she had a few questions to ask.\n\"Tell me,\" she said, \"what led you, in the first instance, to suspect young Mr. Craven of the crime?\"\n\"The footing on which he and Sandy stood towards each other, and the terrible scene that occurred between them only the day before the murder,\" answered Griffiths, promptly. \"Nothing of this, however, was elicited at the inquest, where a very fair face was put on Sandy's relations with the whole of the Craven family. I have subsequently unearthed a good deal respecting the private life of Mr. Harry Craven, and, among other things, I have found out that on the night of the murder he left the house shortly after ten o'clock, and no one, so far as I have been able to ascertain, knows at what hour he returned. Now I must draw your attention, Miss Brooke, to the fact that at the inquest the medical evidence went to prove that the murder had been committed between ten and eleven at night.\"\n\"Do you surmise, then, that the murder was a planned thing on the part of this young man?\"\n\"I do. I believe that he wandered about the grounds until Sandy shut himself in for the night, then aroused him by some outside noise, and, when the old man looked out to ascertain the cause, dealt him a blow with a bludgeon or loaded stick, that caused his death.\"\n\"A cold-blooded crime that, for a boy of nineteen?\"\n\"Yes. He's a good-looking, gentlemanly youngster, too, with manners as mild as milk, but from all accounts is as full of wickedness as an egg is full of meat. Now, to come to another point–if, in connection with these ugly facts, you take into consideration the suddenness of his illness, I think you'll admit that it bears a suspicious appearance and might reasonably give rise to the surmise that it was a plant on his part, in order to get out of the inquest.\"\n\"Who is the doctor attending him?\"\n\"A man called Waters; not much of a practitioner, from all accounts, and no doubt he feels himself highly honoured in being summoned to Troyte's Hill. The Cravens, it seems, have no family doctor. Mrs. Craven, with her missionary experience, is half a doctor herself, and never calls in one except in a serious emergency.\"\n\"The certificate was in order, I suppose?\"\n\"Undoubtedly. And, as if to give colour to the gravity of the case, Mrs. Craven sent a message down to the servants, that if any of them were afraid of the infection they could at once go to their homes. Several of the maids, I believe, took advantage of her permission, and packed their boxes. Miss Craven, who is a delicate girl, was sent away with her maid to stay with friends at Newcastle, and Mrs. Craven isolated herself with her patient in one of the disused wings of the house.\"\nImage of a young woman in a frilly white dress, leaning towards a brick wall, with roses growing up the wall behind her.\nPRETTY MISS CRAVEN.\n\"Has anyone ascertained whether Miss Craven arrived at her destination at Newcastle?\"\nGriffiths drew his brows together in thought.\n\"I did not see any necessity for such a thing,\" he answered. \"I don't quite follow you. What do you mean to imply?\"\n\"Oh, nothing. I don't suppose it matters much: it might have been interesting as a side-issue.\" She broke off for a moment, then added:\n\"Now tell me a little about the butler, the man whose wages were cut down to increase Sandy's pay.\"\n\"Old John Hales? He's a thoroughly worthy, respectable man; he was butler for five or six years to Mr. Craven's brother, when he was master of Troyte's Hill, and then took duty under this Mr. Craven. There's no ground for suspicion in that quarter. Hales's exclamation when he heard of the murder is quite enough to stamp him as an innocent man: 'Serve the old idiot right,' he cried: 'I couldn't pump up a tear for him if I tried for a month of Sundays!' Now I take it, Miss Brooke, a guilty man wouldn't dare make such a speech as that!\"\nImage of a bearded man in a suit (John Hales), carrying a tray wth a tureen.\nTHE BUTLER.\n\"You think not?\"\nGriffiths stared at her. \"I'm a little disappointed in her,\" he thought. \"I'm afraid her powers have been slightly exaggerated if she can't see such a straight-forward thing as that.\"\nAloud he said, a little sharply, \"Well, I don't stand alone in my thinking. No one yet has breathed a word against Hales, and if they did, I've no doubt he could prove an alibi without any trouble, for he lives in the house, and everyone has a good word for him.\"\n\"I suppose Sandy's lodge has been put into order by this time?\"\n\"Yes; after the inquest, and when all possible evidence had been taken, everything was put straight.\"\n\"At the inquest it was stated that no marks of footsteps could be traced in any direction?\"\n\"The long drought we've had would render such a thing impossible, let alone the fact that Sandy's lodge stands right on the graveled drive, without flower-beds or grass borders of any sort around it. But look here, Miss Brooke, don't you be wasting your time over the lodge and its surroundings. Every iota of fact on that matter has been gone through over and over again by me and my chief. What we want you to do is to go straight into the house and concentrate attention on Master Harry's sick-room, and find out what's going on there. What he did outside the house on the night of the 6th, I've no doubt I shall be able to find out for myself. Now, Miss Brooke, you've asked me no end of questions, to which I have replied as fully as it was in my power to do; will you be good enough to answer one question that I wish to put, as straightforwardly as I have answered yours? You have had fullest particulars given you of the condition of Sandy's room when the police entered it on the morning after the murder. No doubt, at the present moment, you can see it all in your mind's eye–the bedstead on its side, the clock on its head, the bed-clothes half-way up the chimney, the little vases and ornaments walking in a straight line towards the door?\"\nLoveday bowed her head.\n\"Very well, Now will you be good enough to tell me what this scene of confusion recalls to your mind before anything else?\"\n\"The room of an unpopular Oxford freshman after a raid upon it by undergrads,\" answered Loveday promptly.\nMr. Griffiths rubbed his hands.\n\"Quite so!\" he ejaculated. \"I see, after all, we are one at heart in this matter, in spite of a little surface disagreement of ideas. Depend upon it, by-and-bye, like the engineers tunneling from different quarters under the Alps, we shall meet at the same point and shake hands. By-the-way, I have arranged for daily communication between us through the postboy who takes the letters to Troyte's Hill. He is trustworthy, and any letter you give him for me will find its way into my hands within the hour.\"\nIt was about three o'clock in the afternoon when Loveday drove in through the park gates of Troyte's Hill, past the lodge where old Sandy had met with his death. It was a pretty little cottage, covered with Virginia creeper and wild honeysuckle, and showing no outward sign of the tragedy that had been enacted within.\nThe park and pleasure-grounds of Troyte's Hill were extensive, and the house itself was a somewhat imposing red brick structure, built, possibly, at the time when Dutch William's taste had grown popular in the country. Its frontage presented a somewhat forlorn appearance, its centre windows–a square of eight–alone seeming to show signs of occupation. With the exception of two windows at the extreme end of the bedroom floor of the north wing, where, possibly, the invalid and his mother were located, and two windows at the extreme end of the ground floor of the south wing, which Loveday ascertained subsequently were those of Mr. Craven's study, not a single window in either wing owned blind or curtain. The wings were extensive, and it was easy to understand that at the extreme end of the one the fever patient would be isolated from the rest of the household, and that at the extreme end of the other Mr. Craven could secure the quiet and freedom from interruption which, no doubt, were essential to the due prosecution of his philological studies.\nAlike on the house and ill-kept grounds were present the stamp of the smallness of the income of the master and owner of the place. The terrace, which ran the length of the house in front, and on to which every window on the ground floor opened, was miserably out of repair: not a lintel or door-post, window-ledge or balcony but what seemed to cry aloud for the touch of the painter. \"Pity me! I have seen better days,\" Loveday could fancy written as a legend across the red-brick porch that gave entrance to the old house.\nThe butler, John Hales, admitted Loveday, shouldered her portmanteau and told her he would show her to her room. He was a tall, powerfully-built man, with a ruddy face and dogged expression of countenance. It was easy to understand that, off and on, there must have been many a sharp encounter between him and old Sandy. He treated Loveday in an easy, familiar fashion, evidently considering that an amanuensis took much the same rank as a nursery governess–that is to say, a little below a lady's maid and a little above a house-maid.\n\"We're short of hands, just now,\" he said, in broad Cumberland dialect, as he led the way up the wide stair case. \"Some of the lasses downstairs took fright at the fever and went home. Cook and I are single-handed, for Moggie, the only maid left, has been told off to wait on Madam and Master Harry. I hope you're not afeared of fever?\"\nLoveday explained that she was not, and asked if the room at the extreme end of the north wing was the one assigned to \"Madam and Master Harry.\"\n\"Yes,\" said the man; \"it's convenient for sick nursing; there's a flight of stairs runs straight down from it to the kitchen quarters. We put all Madam wants at the foot of those stairs and Moggie herself never enters the sick-room. I take it you'll not be seeing Madam for many a day, yet awhile.\"\n\"When shall I see Mr. Craven? At dinner to-night?\"\n\"That's what naebody could say,\" answered Hales. \"He may not come out of his study till past midnight; sometimes he sits there till two or three in the morning. Shouldn't advise you to wait till he wants his dinner–better have a cup of tea and a chop sent up to you. Madam never waits for him at any meal.\"\nAs he finished speaking he deposited the portmanteau outside one of the many doors opening into the gallery.\n\"This is Miss Craven's room,\" he went on; \"cook and me thought you'd better have it, as it would want less getting ready than the other rooms, and work is work when there are so few hands to do it. Oh, my stars! I do declare there is cook putting it straight for you now.\" The last sentence was added as the opened door laid bare to view, the cook, with a duster in her hand, polishing a mirror; the bed had been made, it is true, but otherwise the room must have been much as Miss Craven left it, after a hurried packing up.\nTo the surprise of the two servants Loveday took the matter very lightly.\n\"I have a special talent for arranging rooms and would prefer getting this one straight for myself,\" she said. \"Now, if you will go and get ready that chop and cup of tea we were talking about just now, I shall think it much kinder than if you stayed here doing what I can so easily do for myself.\"\nWhen, however, the cook and butler had departed in company, Loveday showed no disposition to exercise the \"special talent\" of which she had boasted.\nShe first carefully turned the key in the lock and then proceeded to make a thorough and minute investigation of every corner of the room. Not an article of furniture, not an ornament or toilet accessory, but what was lifted from its place and carefully scrutinized. Even the ashes in the grate, the debris of the last fire made there, were raked over and well looked through.\nThis careful investigation of Miss Craven's late surroundings occupied in all about three quarters of an hour, and Loveday, with her hat in her hand, descended the stairs to see Hales crossing the hall to the dining-room with the promised cup of tea and chop.\nIn silence and solitude she partook of the simple repast in a dining-hall that could with ease have banqueted a hundred and fifty guests.\nImage of a woman in dark dress (Loveday Brooke), seated at a table with a crisp tablecloth and fancy dishes before her.\nIN SILENCE AND SOLITUDE SHE PARTOOK OF THE SIMPLE REPAST.\n\"Now for the grounds before it gets dark,\" she said to herself, as she noted that already the outside shadows were beginning to slant.\nThe dining-hall was at the back of the house; and here, as in the front, the windows, reaching to the ground, presented easy means of egress. The flower-garden was on this side of the house and sloped downhill to a pretty stretch of well-wooded country.\nLoveday did not linger here even to admire, but passed at once round the south corner of the house to the windows which she had ascertained, by a careless question to the butler, were those of Mr. Craven's study.\nVery cautiously she drew near them, for the blinds were up, the curtains drawn back. A side glance, however, relieved her apprehensions, for it showed her the occupant of the room, seated in an easy-chair, with his back to the windows. From the length of his outstretched limbs he was evidently a tall man. His hair was silvery and curly, the lower part of his face was hidden from her view by the chair, but she could see one hand was pressed tightly across his eyes and brows. The whole attitude was that of a man absorbed in deep thought. The room was comfortably furnished, but presented an appearance of disorder from the books and manuscripts scattered in all directions. A whole pile of torn fragments of foolscap sheets, overflowing from a waste-paper basket beside the writing-table, seemed to proclaim the fact that the scholar had of late grown weary of, or else dissatisfied with his work, and had condemned it freely.\nImage of a man in a suit seated in a chair. He is turned away from a table overflowing with papers, and is holding his hand over his forehead.\nSEATED IN AN EASY-CHAIR WITH HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW.\nAlthough Loveday stood looking in at this window for over five minutes, not the faintest sign of life did that tall, reclining figure give, and it would have been as easy to believe him locked in sleep as in thought.\nFrom here she turned her steps in the direction of Sandy's lodge. As Griffiths had said, it was graveled up to its doorstep. The blinds were closely drawn, and it presented the ordinary appearance of a disused cottage.\nA narrow path beneath over-arching boughs of cherry-laurel and arbutus, immediately facing the lodge, caught her eye, and down this she at once turned her footsteps.\nThis path led, with many a wind and turn, through a belt of shrubbery that skirted the frontage of Mr. Craven's grounds, and eventually, after much zig-zagging, ended in close proximity to the stables. As Loveday entered it, she seemed literally to leave daylight behind her.\n\"I feel as if I were following the course of a circuitous mind,\" she said to herself as the shadows closed around her. \"I could not fancy Sir Isaac Newton or Bacon planning or delighting in such a wind-about-alley as this!\"\nThe path showed greyly in front of her out of the dimness. On and on she followed it; here and there the roots of the old laurels, struggling out of the ground, threatened to trip her up. Her eyes, however, had now grown accustomed to the half-gloom, and not a detail of her surroundings escaped her as she went along.\nA bird flew from out the thicket on her right hand with a startled cry. A dainty little frog leaped out of her way into the shriveled leaves lying below the laurels. Following the movements of this frog, her eye was caught by something black and solid among those leaves. What was it? A bundle–a shiny black coat? Loveday knelt down, and using her hands to assist her eyes, found that they came into contact with the dead, stiffened body of a beautiful black retriever. She parted, as well as she was able, the lower boughs of the evergreens, and minutely examined the poor animal. Its eyes were still open, though glazed and bleared, and its death had, undoubtedly, been caused by the blow of some blunt, heavy instrument, for on one side its skull was almost battered in.\n\"Exactly the death that was dealt to Sandy,\" she thought, as she groped hither and thither beneath the trees in hopes of lighting upon the weapon of destruction.\nShe searched until increasing darkness warned her that search was useless. Then, still following the zig-zagging path, she made her way out by the stables and thence back to the house.\nShe went to bed that night without having spoken to a soul beyond the cook and butler. The next morning, however, Mr. Craven introduced himself to her across the breakfast-table. He was a man of really handsome personal appearance, with a fine carriage of the head and shoulders, and eyes that had a forlorn, appealing look in them. He entered the room with an air of great energy, apologized to Loveday for the absence of his wife, and for his own remissness in not being in the way to receive her on the previous day. Then he bade her make herself at home at the breakfast-table, and expressed his delight in having found a coadjutor in his work.\n\"I hope you understand what a great–a stupendous work it is?\" he added, as he sank into a chair. \"It is a work that will leave its impress upon thought in all the ages to come. Only a man who has studied comparative philology as I have for the past thirty years, could gauge the magnitude of the task I have set myself.\"\nWith the last remark, his energy seemed spent, and he sank back in his chair, covering his eyes with his hand in precisely the same attitude as that in which Loveday had seen him over-night, and utterly oblivious of the fact that breakfast was before him and a stranger-guest seated at table. The butler entered with another dish. \"Better go on with your breakfast,\" he whispered to Loveday, \"he may sit like that for another hour.\"\nHe placed his dish in front of his master.\n\"Captain hasn't come back yet, sir,\" he said, making an effort to arouse him from his reverie.\n\"Eh, what?\" said Mr. Craven, for a moment lifting his hand from his eyes.\n\"Captain, sir–the black retriever,\" repeated the man.\nThe pathetic look in Mr. Craven's eyes deepened.\n\"Ah, poor Captain!\" he murmured; \"the best dog I ever had.\"\nThen he again sank back in his chair, putting his hand to his forehead.\nThe butler made one more effort to arouse him.\n\"Madam sent you down a newspaper, sir, that she thought you would like to see,\" he shouted almost into his master's ear, and at the same time laid the morning's paper on the table beside his plate.\nImage of a woman in dark dress (Loveday Brooke) seated across a dining from a man in a suit (Mr. Craven) with a hand clasped over his face. His butler is standing beside him.\nHE LAID THE MORNING'S PAPER BESIDE HIS PLATE.\n\"Confound you! leave it there,\" said Mr. Craven irritably. \"Fools! dolts that you all are! With your trivialities and interruptions you are sending me out of the world with my work undone!\"\nAnd again he sank back in his chair, closed his eyes and became lost to his surroundings.\nLoveday went on with her breakfast. She changed her place at table to one on Mr. Craven's right hand, so that the newspaper sent down for his perusal lay between his plate and hers. It was folded into an oblong shape, as if it were wished to direct attention to a certain portion of a certain column.\nA clock in a corner of the room struck the hour with a loud, resonant stroke. Mr. Craven gave a start and rubbed his eyes.\n\"Eh, what's this?\" he said. \"What meal are we at?\" He looked around with a bewildered air. \"Eh!–who are you?\" he went on, staring hard at Loveday. \"What are you doing here? Where's Nina?–Where's Harry?\"\nLoveday began to explain, and gradually recollection seemed to come back to him.\n\"Ah, yes, yes,\" he said. \"I remember; you've come to assist me with my great work. You promised, you know, to help me out of the hole I've got into. Very enthusiastic, I remember they said you were, on certain abstruse points in comparative philology. Now, Miss–Miss–I've forgotten your name–tell me a little of what you know about the elemental sounds of speech that are common to all languages. Now, to how many would you reduce those elemental sounds–to six, eight, nine? No, we won't discuss the matter here, the cups and saucers distract me. Come into my den at the other end of the house; we'll have perfect quiet there.\"\nAnd utterly ignoring the fact that he had not as yet broken his fast, he rose from the table, seized Loveday by the wrist, and led her out of the room and down the long corridor that led through the south wing to his study.\nBut seated in that study his energy once more speedily exhausted itself.\nHe placed Loveday in a comfortable chair at his writing-table, consulted her taste as to pens, and spread a sheet of foolscap before her. Then he settled himself in his easy-chair, with his back to the light, as if he were about to dictate folios to her.\nIn a loud, distinct voice he repeated the title of his learned work, then its sub-division, then the number and heading of the chapter that was at present engaging his attention. Then he put his hand to his head. \"It's the elemental sounds that are my stumbling-block,\" he said. \"Now, how on earth is it possible to get a notion of a sound of agony that is not in part a sound of terror? or a sound of surprise that is not in part a sound of either joy or sorrow?\"\nWith this his energies were spent, and although Loveday remained seated in that study from early morning till daylight began to fade, she had not ten sentences to show for her day's work as amanuensis.\nLoveday in all spent only two clear days at Troyte's Hill.\nOn the evening of the first of those days Detective Griffiths received, through the trustworthy post-boy, the following brief note from her:\n\"I have found out that Hales owed Sandy close upon a hundred pounds, which he had borrowed at various times. I don't know whether you will think this fact of any importance.–L. B.\"\nMr. Griffiths repeated the last sentence blankly. \"If Harry Craven were put upon his defence, his counsel, I take it, would consider the fact of first importance,\" he muttered. And for the remainder of that day Mr. Griffiths went about his work in a perturbed state of mind, doubtful whether to hold or to let go his theory concerning Harry Craven's guilt.\nThe next morning there came another brief note from Loveday which ran thus:\n\"As a matter of collateral interest, find out if a person, calling himself Harold Cousins, sailed two days ago from London Docks for Natal in the Bonnie Dundee?\"\nTo this missive Loveday received, in reply, the following somewhat lengthy dispatch:\n\"I do not quite see the drift of your last note, but have wired to our agents in London to carry out its suggestion. On my part, I have important news to communicate. I have found out what Harry Craven's business out of doors was on the night of the murder, and at my instance a warrant has been issued for his arrest. This warrant it will be my duty to serve on him in the course of to-day. Things are beginning to look very black against him, and I am convinced his illness is all a sham. I have seen Waters, the man who is supposed to be attending him, and have driven him into a corner and made him admit that he has only seen young Craven once–on the first day of his illness–and that he gave his certificate entirely on the strength of what Mrs. Craven told him of her son's condition. On the occasion of this, his first and only visit, the lady, it seems, also told him that it would not be necessary for him to continue his attendance, as she quite felt herself competent to treat the case, having had so much experience in fever cases among the blacks at Natal.\n\"As I left Waters's house, after eliciting this important information, I was accosted by a man who keeps a low-class inn in the place, McQueen by name. He said that he wished to speak to me on a matter of importance. To make a long story short, this McQueen stated that on the night of the sixth, shortly after eleven o'clock, Harry Craven came to his house, bringing with him a valuable piece of plate–a handsome epergne–and requested him to lend him a hundred pounds on it, as he hadn't a penny in his pocket. McQueen complied with his request to the extent of ten sovereigns, and now, in a fit of nervous terror, comes to me to confess himself a receiver of stolen goods and play the honest man! He says he noticed that the young gentleman was very much agitated as he made the request, and he also begged him to mention his visit to no one. Now, I am curious to learn how Master Harry will get over the fact that he passed the lodge at the hour at which the murder was most probably committed; or how he will get out of the dilemma of having repassed the lodge on his way back to the house, and not noticed the wide-open window with the full moon shining down on it?\n\"Another word! Keep out of the way when I arrive at the house, somewhere between two and three in the afternoon, to serve the warrant. I do not wish your professional capacity to get wind, for you will most likely yet be of some use to us in the house.\n\"S.G.\"\nImage of a man (McQueen) seated by a table full of beer bottles and mugs, in a tavern. He's scowling up at a thin man in a suit with a hand to his face and a hand on the door.\nWANTED A HUNDRED POUNDS.\nLoveday read this note, seated at Mr. Craven's writing-table, with the old gentleman himself reclining motionless beside her in his easy-chair. A little smile played about the corners of her mouth as she read over again the words–\"for you will most likely yet be of some use to us in the house.\"\nLoveday's second day in Mr. Craven's study promised to be as unfruitful as the first. For fully an hour after she had received Griffiths' note, she sat at the writing-table with her pen in her hand, ready to transcribe Mr. Craven's inspirations. Beyond, however, the phrase, muttered with closed eyes–\"It's all here, in my brain, but I can't put it into words\"–not a half-syllable escaped his lips.\nAt the end of that hour the sound of footsteps on the outside gravel made her turn her head towards the window. It was Griffiths approaching with two constables. She heard the hall door opened to admit them, but, beyond that, not a sound reached her ear, and she realized how fully she was cut off from communication with the rest of the household at the farther end of this unoccupied wing.\nMr. Craven, still reclining in his semi-trance, evidently had not the faintest suspicion that so important an event as the arrest of his only son on a charge of murder was about to be enacted in the house.\nMeantime, Griffiths and his constables had mounted the stairs leading to the north wing, and were being guided through the corridors to the sick-room by the flying figure of Moggie, the maid.\n\"Hoot, mistress!\" cried the girl, \"here are three men coming up the stairs–policemen, every one of them–will ye come and ask them what they be wanting?\"\nOutside the door of the sick-room stood Mrs. Craven–a tall, sharp-featured woman with sandy hair going rapidly grey.\n\"What is the meaning of this? What is your business here?\" she said haughtily, addressing Griffiths, who headed the party.\nGriffiths respectfully explained what his business was, and requested her to stand on one side that he might enter her son's room.\n\"This is my daughter's room; satisfy yourself of the fact,\" said the lady, throwing back the door as she spoke.\nAnd Griffiths and his confrères entered, to find pretty Miss Craven, looking very white and scared, seated beside a fire in a long flowing robe de chambre.\nImage of a woman (Miss Craven) slumped over on a chair, looking up plaintively.\nMISS CRAVEN LOOKING VERY WHITE AND SCARED.\nGriffiths departed in haste and confusion, without the chance of a professional talk with Loveday. That afternoon saw him telegraphing wildly in all directions, and dispatching messengers in all quarters. Finally he spent over an hour drawing up an elaborate report to his chief at Newcastle, assuring him of the identity of one, Harold Cousins, who had sailed in the Bonnie Dundee for Natal, with Harry Craven, of Troyte's Hill, and advising that the police authorities in that far-away district should be immediately communicated with.\n",
      "prompt": "Summarize the following document for Detective story 'The Murder at Troyte's Hill' by Unknown. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\n\"GRIFFITHS, of the Newcastle Constabulary, has the case in hand,\" said Mr. Dyer; \"those Newcastle men are keen-witted, shrewd fellows, and very jealous of outside interference. They only sent to me under protest, as it were, because they wanted your sharp wits at work inside the house.\"\n\"I suppose throughout I am to work with Griffiths, not with you?\" said Miss Brooke.\n\"Yes; when I have given you in outline the facts of the case, I simply have nothing more to do with it, and you must depend on Griffiths for any assistance of any sort that you may require.\"\nHere, with a swing, Mr. Dyer opened his big ledger and turned rapidly over its leaves till he came to the heading \"Troyte's Hill\" and the date \"September 6th.\"\n\"I'm all attention,\" said Loveday, leaning back in her chair in the attitude of a listener.\n\"The murdered man,\" resumed Mr. Dyer, \"is a certain Alexander Henderson–usually known as old Sandy–lodge-keeper to Mr. Craven, of Troyte's Hill, Cumberland. The lodge consists merely of two rooms on the ground floor, a bedroom and a sitting-room; these Sandy occupied alone, having neither kith nor kin of any degree. On the morning of September 6th, some children going up to the house with milk from the farm, noticed that Sandy's bed-room window stood wide open. Curiosity prompted them to peep in; and then, to their horror, they saw old Sandy, in his night-shirt, lying dead on the floor, as if he had fallen backwards from the window. They raised an alarm; and on examination, it was found that death had ensued from a heavy blow on the temple, given either by a strong fist or some blunt instrument. The room, on being entered, presented a curious appearance. It was as if a herd of monkeys had been turned into it and allowed to work their impish will. Not an article of furniture remained in its place: the bed-clothes had been rolled into a bundle and stuffed into the chimney; the bedstead–a small iron one–lay on its side; the one chair in the room stood on the top of the table; fender and fire-irons lay across the washstand, whose basin was to be found in a farther corner, holding bolster and pillow. The clock stood on its head in the middle of the mantelpiece; and the small vases and ornaments, which flanked it on either side, were walking, as it were, in a straight line towards the door. The old man's clothes had been rolled into a ball and thrown on the top of a high cupboard in which he kept his savings and whatever valuables he had. This cupboard, however, had not been meddled with, and its contents remained intact, so it was evident that robbery was not the motive for the crime. At the inquest, subsequently held, a verdict of 'willful murder' against some person or persons unknown was returned. The local police are diligently investigating the affair, but, as yet, no arrests have been made. The opinion that at present prevails in the neighbourhood is that the crime has been perpetrated by some lunatic, escaped or otherwise and enquiries are being made at the local asylums as to missing or lately released inmates. Griffiths, however, tells me that his suspicions set in another direction.\"\nImage of bearded man (old Sandy) lying on a floor, in a nightshirt.\nTHEY SAW OLD SANDY LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR.\n\"Did anything of importance transpire at the inquest?\"\n\"Nothing specially important. Mr. Craven broke down in giving his evidence when he alluded to the confidential relations that had always subsisted between Sandy and himself, and spoke of the last time that he had seen him alive. The evidence of the butler, and one or two of the female servants, seems clear enough, and they let fall something of a hint that Sandy was not altogether a favourite among them, on account of the overbearing manner in which he used his influence with his master. Young Mr. Craven, a youth of about nineteen, home from Oxford for the long vacation, was not present at the inquest; a doctor's certificate was put in stating that he was suffering from typhoid fever, and could not leave his bed without risk to his life. Now this young man is a thoroughly bad sort, and as much a gentleman-blackleg as it is possible for such a young fellow to be. It seems to Griffiths that there is something suspicious about this illness of his. He came back from Oxford on the verge of delirium tremens, pulled round from that, and then suddenly, on the day after the murder, Mrs. Craven rings the bell, announces that he has developed typhoid fever and orders a doctor to be sent for.\"\n\"What sort of man is Mr. Craven senior?\"\n\"He seems to be a quiet old fellow, a scholar and learned philologist. Neither his neighbours nor his family see much of him; he almost lives in his study, writing a treatise, in seven or eight volumes, on comparative philology. He is not a rich man. Troyte's Hill, though it carries position in the county, is not a paying property, and Mr. Craven is unable to keep it up properly. I am told he has had to cut down expenses in all directions in order to send his son to college, and his daughter from first to last has been entirely educated by her mother. Mr. Craven was originally intended for the church, but for some reason or other, when his college career came to an end, he did not present himself for ordination–went out to Natal instead, where he obtained some civil appointment and where he remained for about fifteen years. Henderson was his servant during the latter portion of his Oxford career, and must have been greatly respected by him, for although the remuneration derived from his appointment at Natal was small, he paid Sandy a regular yearly allowance out of it. When, about ten years ago, he succeeded to Troyte's Hill, on the death of his elder brother, and returned home with his family, Sandy was immediately installed as lodge-keeper, and at so high a rate of pay that the butler's wages were cut down to meet it.\"\n\"Ah, that wouldn't improve the butler's feelings towards him,\" ejaculated Loveday.\nMr. Dyer went on: \"But, in spite of his high wages, he doesn't appear to have troubled much about his duties as lodge-keeper, for they were performed, as a rule, by the gardener's boy, while he took his meals and passed his time at the house, and, speaking generally, put his finger into every pie. You know the old adage respecting the servant of twenty-one years' standing: 'Seven years my servant, seven years my equal, seven years my master.' Well, it appears to have held good in the case of Mr. Craven and Sandy. The old gentleman, absorbed in his philological studies, evidently let the reins slip through his fingers, and Sandy seems to have taken easy possession of them. The servants frequently had to go to him for orders, and he carried things, as a rule, with a high hand.\"\n\"Did Mrs. Craven never have a word to say on the matter?\"\n\"I've not heard much about her. She seems to be a quiet sort of person. She is a Scotch missionary's daughter; perhaps she spends her time working for the Cape mission and that sort of thing.\"\n\"And young Mr. Craven: did he knock under to Sandy's rule?\"\n\"Ah, now you're hitting the bull's eye and we come to Griffiths' theory. The young man and Sandy appear to have been at loggerheads ever since the Cravens took possession of Troyte's Hill. As a schoolboy Master Harry defied Sandy and threatened him with his hunting-crop; and subsequently, as a young man, has used strenuous endeavours to put the old servant in his place. On the day before the murder, Griffiths says, there was a terrible scene between the two, in which the young gentleman, in the presence of several witnesses, made use of strong language and threatened the old man's life. Now, Miss Brooke, I have told you all the circumstances of the case so far as I know them. For fuller particulars I must refer you to Griffiths. He, no doubt, will meet you at Grenfell–the nearest station to Troyte's Hill, and tell you in what capacity he has procured for you an entrance into the house. By-the-way, he has wired to me this morning that he hopes you will be able to save the Scotch express to-night.\"\nLoveday expressed her readiness to comply with Mr. Griffiths' wishes.\n\"I shall be glad,\" said Mr. Dyer, as he shook hands with her at the office door, \"to see you immediately on your return–that, however, I suppose, will not be yet awhile. This promises, I fancy, to be a longish affair?\" This was said interrogatively.\n\"I haven't the least idea on the matter,\" answered Loveday. \"I start on my work without theory of any sort–in fact, I may say, with my mind a perfect blank.\"\nAnd anyone who had caught a glimpse of her blank, expressionless features, as she said this, would have taken her at her word.\nGrenfell, the nearest post-town to Troyte's Hill, is a fairly busy, populous little town–looking south towards the black country, and northwards to low, barren hills. Pre-eminent among these stands Troyte's Hill, famed in the old days as a border keep, and possibly at a still earlier date as a Druid stronghold.\nAt a small inn at Grenfell, dignified by the title of \"The Station Hotel,\" Mr. Griffiths, of the Newcastle constabulary, met Loveday and still further initiated her into the mysteries of the Troyte's Hill murder.\n\"A little of the first excitement has subsided,\" he said, after preliminary greetings had been exchanged; \"but still the wildest rumours are flying about and repeated as solemnly as if they were Gospel truths. My chief here and my colleagues generally adhere to their first conviction, that the criminal is some suddenly crazed tramp or else an escaped lunatic, and they are confident that sooner or later we shall come upon his traces. Their theory is that Sandy, hearing some strange noise at the Park Gates, put his head out of the window to ascertain the cause and immediately had his death blow dealt him; then they suppose that the lunatic scrambled into the room through the window and exhausted his frenzy by turning things generally upside down. They refuse altogether to share my suspicions respecting young Mr. Craven.\"\nMr. Griffiths was a tall, thin-featured man, with iron-grey hair, but so close to his head that it refused to do anything but stand on end. This gave a somewhat comic expression to the upper portion of his face and clashed oddly with the melancholy look that his mouth habitually wore.\n\"I have made all smooth for you at Troyte's Hill,\" he presently went on. \"Mr. Craven is not wealthy enough to allow himself the luxury of a family lawyer, so he occasionally employs the services of Messrs. Wells and Sugden, lawyers in this place, and who, as it happens, have, off and on, done a good deal of business for me. It was through them I heard that Mr. Craven was anxious to secure the assistance of an amanuensis. I immediately offered your services, stating that you were a friend of mine, a lady of impoverished means, who would gladly undertake the duties for the munificent sum of a guinea a month, with board and lodging. The old gentleman at once jumped at the offer, and is anxious for you to be at Troyte's Hill at once.\"\nLoveday expressed her satisfaction with the programme that Mr. Griffiths had sketched for her, then she had a few questions to ask.\n\"Tell me,\" she said, \"what led you, in the first instance, to suspect young Mr. Craven of the crime?\"\n\"The footing on which he and Sandy stood towards each other, and the terrible scene that occurred between them only the day before the murder,\" answered Griffiths, promptly. \"Nothing of this, however, was elicited at the inquest, where a very fair face was put on Sandy's relations with the whole of the Craven family. I have subsequently unearthed a good deal respecting the private life of Mr. Harry Craven, and, among other things, I have found out that on the night of the murder he left the house shortly after ten o'clock, and no one, so far as I have been able to ascertain, knows at what hour he returned. Now I must draw your attention, Miss Brooke, to the fact that at the inquest the medical evidence went to prove that the murder had been committed between ten and eleven at night.\"\n\"Do you surmise, then, that the murder was a planned thing on the part of this young man?\"\n\"I do. I believe that he wandered about the grounds until Sandy shut himself in for the night, then aroused him by some outside noise, and, when the old man looked out to ascertain the cause, dealt him a blow with a bludgeon or loaded stick, that caused his death.\"\n\"A cold-blooded crime that, for a boy of nineteen?\"\n\"Yes. He's a good-looking, gentlemanly youngster, too, with manners as mild as milk, but from all accounts is as full of wickedness as an egg is full of meat. Now, to come to another point–if, in connection with these ugly facts, you take into consideration the suddenness of his illness, I think you'll admit that it bears a suspicious appearance and might reasonably give rise to the surmise that it was a plant on his part, in order to get out of the inquest.\"\n\"Who is the doctor attending him?\"\n\"A man called Waters; not much of a practitioner, from all accounts, and no doubt he feels himself highly honoured in being summoned to Troyte's Hill. The Cravens, it seems, have no family doctor. Mrs. Craven, with her missionary experience, is half a doctor herself, and never calls in one except in a serious emergency.\"\n\"The certificate was in order, I suppose?\"\n\"Undoubtedly. And, as if to give colour to the gravity of the case, Mrs. Craven sent a message down to the servants, that if any of them were afraid of the infection they could at once go to their homes. Several of the maids, I believe, took advantage of her permission, and packed their boxes. Miss Craven, who is a delicate girl, was sent away with her maid to stay with friends at Newcastle, and Mrs. Craven isolated herself with her patient in one of the disused wings of the house.\"\nImage of a young woman in a frilly white dress, leaning towards a brick wall, with roses growing up the wall behind her.\nPRETTY MISS CRAVEN.\n\"Has anyone ascertained whether Miss Craven arrived at her destination at Newcastle?\"\nGriffiths drew his brows together in thought.\n\"I did not see any necessity for such a thing,\" he answered. \"I don't quite follow you. What do you mean to imply?\"\n\"Oh, nothing. I don't suppose it matters much: it might have been interesting as a side-issue.\" She broke off for a moment, then added:\n\"Now tell me a little about the butler, the man whose wages were cut down to increase Sandy's pay.\"\n\"Old John Hales? He's a thoroughly worthy, respectable man; he was butler for five or six years to Mr. Craven's brother, when he was master of Troyte's Hill, and then took duty under this Mr. Craven. There's no ground for suspicion in that quarter. Hales's exclamation when he heard of the murder is quite enough to stamp him as an innocent man: 'Serve the old idiot right,' he cried: 'I couldn't pump up a tear for him if I tried for a month of Sundays!' Now I take it, Miss Brooke, a guilty man wouldn't dare make such a speech as that!\"\nImage of a bearded man in a suit (John Hales), carrying a tray wth a tureen.\nTHE BUTLER.\n\"You think not?\"\nGriffiths stared at her. \"I'm a little disappointed in her,\" he thought. \"I'm afraid her powers have been slightly exaggerated if she can't see such a straight-forward thing as that.\"\nAloud he said, a little sharply, \"Well, I don't stand alone in my thinking. No one yet has breathed a word against Hales, and if they did, I've no doubt he could prove an alibi without any trouble, for he lives in the house, and everyone has a good word for him.\"\n\"I suppose Sandy's lodge has been put into order by this time?\"\n\"Yes; after the inquest, and when all possible evidence had been taken, everything was put straight.\"\n\"At the inquest it was stated that no marks of footsteps could be traced in any direction?\"\n\"The long drought we've had would render such a thing impossible, let alone the fact that Sandy's lodge stands right on the graveled drive, without flower-beds or grass borders of any sort around it. But look here, Miss Brooke, don't you be wasting your time over the lodge and its surroundings. Every iota of fact on that matter has been gone through over and over again by me and my chief. What we want you to do is to go straight into the house and concentrate attention on Master Harry's sick-room, and find out what's going on there. What he did outside the house on the night of the 6th, I've no doubt I shall be able to find out for myself. Now, Miss Brooke, you've asked me no end of questions, to which I have replied as fully as it was in my power to do; will you be good enough to answer one question that I wish to put, as straightforwardly as I have answered yours? You have had fullest particulars given you of the condition of Sandy's room when the police entered it on the morning after the murder. No doubt, at the present moment, you can see it all in your mind's eye–the bedstead on its side, the clock on its head, the bed-clothes half-way up the chimney, the little vases and ornaments walking in a straight line towards the door?\"\nLoveday bowed her head.\n\"Very well, Now will you be good enough to tell me what this scene of confusion recalls to your mind before anything else?\"\n\"The room of an unpopular Oxford freshman after a raid upon it by undergrads,\" answered Loveday promptly.\nMr. Griffiths rubbed his hands.\n\"Quite so!\" he ejaculated. \"I see, after all, we are one at heart in this matter, in spite of a little surface disagreement of ideas. Depend upon it, by-and-bye, like the engineers tunneling from different quarters under the Alps, we shall meet at the same point and shake hands. By-the-way, I have arranged for daily communication between us through the postboy who takes the letters to Troyte's Hill. He is trustworthy, and any letter you give him for me will find its way into my hands within the hour.\"\nIt was about three o'clock in the afternoon when Loveday drove in through the park gates of Troyte's Hill, past the lodge where old Sandy had met with his death. It was a pretty little cottage, covered with Virginia creeper and wild honeysuckle, and showing no outward sign of the tragedy that had been enacted within.\nThe park and pleasure-grounds of Troyte's Hill were extensive, and the house itself was a somewhat imposing red brick structure, built, possibly, at the time when Dutch William's taste had grown popular in the country. Its frontage presented a somewhat forlorn appearance, its centre windows–a square of eight–alone seeming to show signs of occupation. With the exception of two windows at the extreme end of the bedroom floor of the north wing, where, possibly, the invalid and his mother were located, and two windows at the extreme end of the ground floor of the south wing, which Loveday ascertained subsequently were those of Mr. Craven's study, not a single window in either wing owned blind or curtain. The wings were extensive, and it was easy to understand that at the extreme end of the one the fever patient would be isolated from the rest of the household, and that at the extreme end of the other Mr. Craven could secure the quiet and freedom from interruption which, no doubt, were essential to the due prosecution of his philological studies.\nAlike on the house and ill-kept grounds were present the stamp of the smallness of the income of the master and owner of the place. The terrace, which ran the length of the house in front, and on to which every window on the ground floor opened, was miserably out of repair: not a lintel or door-post, window-ledge or balcony but what seemed to cry aloud for the touch of the painter. \"Pity me! I have seen better days,\" Loveday could fancy written as a legend across the red-brick porch that gave entrance to the old house.\nThe butler, John Hales, admitted Loveday, shouldered her portmanteau and told her he would show her to her room. He was a tall, powerfully-built man, with a ruddy face and dogged expression of countenance. It was easy to understand that, off and on, there must have been many a sharp encounter between him and old Sandy. He treated Loveday in an easy, familiar fashion, evidently considering that an amanuensis took much the same rank as a nursery governess–that is to say, a little below a lady's maid and a little above a house-maid.\n\"We're short of hands, just now,\" he said, in broad Cumberland dialect, as he led the way up the wide stair case. \"Some of the lasses downstairs took fright at the fever and went home. Cook and I are single-handed, for Moggie, the only maid left, has been told off to wait on Madam and Master Harry. I hope you're not afeared of fever?\"\nLoveday explained that she was not, and asked if the room at the extreme end of the north wing was the one assigned to \"Madam and Master Harry.\"\n\"Yes,\" said the man; \"it's convenient for sick nursing; there's a flight of stairs runs straight down from it to the kitchen quarters. We put all Madam wants at the foot of those stairs and Moggie herself never enters the sick-room. I take it you'll not be seeing Madam for many a day, yet awhile.\"\n\"When shall I see Mr. Craven? At dinner to-night?\"\n\"That's what naebody could say,\" answered Hales. \"He may not come out of his study till past midnight; sometimes he sits there till two or three in the morning. Shouldn't advise you to wait till he wants his dinner–better have a cup of tea and a chop sent up to you. Madam never waits for him at any meal.\"\nAs he finished speaking he deposited the portmanteau outside one of the many doors opening into the gallery.\n\"This is Miss Craven's room,\" he went on; \"cook and me thought you'd better have it, as it would want less getting ready than the other rooms, and work is work when there are so few hands to do it. Oh, my stars! I do declare there is cook putting it straight for you now.\" The last sentence was added as the opened door laid bare to view, the cook, with a duster in her hand, polishing a mirror; the bed had been made, it is true, but otherwise the room must have been much as Miss Craven left it, after a hurried packing up.\nTo the surprise of the two servants Loveday took the matter very lightly.\n\"I have a special talent for arranging rooms and would prefer getting this one straight for myself,\" she said. \"Now, if you will go and get ready that chop and cup of tea we were talking about just now, I shall think it much kinder than if you stayed here doing what I can so easily do for myself.\"\nWhen, however, the cook and butler had departed in company, Loveday showed no disposition to exercise the \"special talent\" of which she had boasted.\nShe first carefully turned the key in the lock and then proceeded to make a thorough and minute investigation of every corner of the room. Not an article of furniture, not an ornament or toilet accessory, but what was lifted from its place and carefully scrutinized. Even the ashes in the grate, the debris of the last fire made there, were raked over and well looked through.\nThis careful investigation of Miss Craven's late surroundings occupied in all about three quarters of an hour, and Loveday, with her hat in her hand, descended the stairs to see Hales crossing the hall to the dining-room with the promised cup of tea and chop.\nIn silence and solitude she partook of the simple repast in a dining-hall that could with ease have banqueted a hundred and fifty guests.\nImage of a woman in dark dress (Loveday Brooke), seated at a table with a crisp tablecloth and fancy dishes before her.\nIN SILENCE AND SOLITUDE SHE PARTOOK OF THE SIMPLE REPAST.\n\"Now for the grounds before it gets dark,\" she said to herself, as she noted that already the outside shadows were beginning to slant.\nThe dining-hall was at the back of the house; and here, as in the front, the windows, reaching to the ground, presented easy means of egress. The flower-garden was on this side of the house and sloped downhill to a pretty stretch of well-wooded country.\nLoveday did not linger here even to admire, but passed at once round the south corner of the house to the windows which she had ascertained, by a careless question to the butler, were those of Mr. Craven's study.\nVery cautiously she drew near them, for the blinds were up, the curtains drawn back. A side glance, however, relieved her apprehensions, for it showed her the occupant of the room, seated in an easy-chair, with his back to the windows. From the length of his outstretched limbs he was evidently a tall man. His hair was silvery and curly, the lower part of his face was hidden from her view by the chair, but she could see one hand was pressed tightly across his eyes and brows. The whole attitude was that of a man absorbed in deep thought. The room was comfortably furnished, but presented an appearance of disorder from the books and manuscripts scattered in all directions. A whole pile of torn fragments of foolscap sheets, overflowing from a waste-paper basket beside the writing-table, seemed to proclaim the fact that the scholar had of late grown weary of, or else dissatisfied with his work, and had condemned it freely.\nImage of a man in a suit seated in a chair. He is turned away from a table overflowing with papers, and is holding his hand over his forehead.\nSEATED IN AN EASY-CHAIR WITH HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW.\nAlthough Loveday stood looking in at this window for over five minutes, not the faintest sign of life did that tall, reclining figure give, and it would have been as easy to believe him locked in sleep as in thought.\nFrom here she turned her steps in the direction of Sandy's lodge. As Griffiths had said, it was graveled up to its doorstep. The blinds were closely drawn, and it presented the ordinary appearance of a disused cottage.\nA narrow path beneath over-arching boughs of cherry-laurel and arbutus, immediately facing the lodge, caught her eye, and down this she at once turned her footsteps.\nThis path led, with many a wind and turn, through a belt of shrubbery that skirted the frontage of Mr. Craven's grounds, and eventually, after much zig-zagging, ended in close proximity to the stables. As Loveday entered it, she seemed literally to leave daylight behind her.\n\"I feel as if I were following the course of a circuitous mind,\" she said to herself as the shadows closed around her. \"I could not fancy Sir Isaac Newton or Bacon planning or delighting in such a wind-about-alley as this!\"\nThe path showed greyly in front of her out of the dimness. On and on she followed it; here and there the roots of the old laurels, struggling out of the ground, threatened to trip her up. Her eyes, however, had now grown accustomed to the half-gloom, and not a detail of her surroundings escaped her as she went along.\nA bird flew from out the thicket on her right hand with a startled cry. A dainty little frog leaped out of her way into the shriveled leaves lying below the laurels. Following the movements of this frog, her eye was caught by something black and solid among those leaves. What was it? A bundle–a shiny black coat? Loveday knelt down, and using her hands to assist her eyes, found that they came into contact with the dead, stiffened body of a beautiful black retriever. She parted, as well as she was able, the lower boughs of the evergreens, and minutely examined the poor animal. Its eyes were still open, though glazed and bleared, and its death had, undoubtedly, been caused by the blow of some blunt, heavy instrument, for on one side its skull was almost battered in.\n\"Exactly the death that was dealt to Sandy,\" she thought, as she groped hither and thither beneath the trees in hopes of lighting upon the weapon of destruction.\nShe searched until increasing darkness warned her that search was useless. Then, still following the zig-zagging path, she made her way out by the stables and thence back to the house.\nShe went to bed that night without having spoken to a soul beyond the cook and butler. The next morning, however, Mr. Craven introduced himself to her across the breakfast-table. He was a man of really handsome personal appearance, with a fine carriage of the head and shoulders, and eyes that had a forlorn, appealing look in them. He entered the room with an air of great energy, apologized to Loveday for the absence of his wife, and for his own remissness in not being in the way to receive her on the previous day. Then he bade her make herself at home at the breakfast-table, and expressed his delight in having found a coadjutor in his work.\n\"I hope you understand what a great–a stupendous work it is?\" he added, as he sank into a chair. \"It is a work that will leave its impress upon thought in all the ages to come. Only a man who has studied comparative philology as I have for the past thirty years, could gauge the magnitude of the task I have set myself.\"\nWith the last remark, his energy seemed spent, and he sank back in his chair, covering his eyes with his hand in precisely the same attitude as that in which Loveday had seen him over-night, and utterly oblivious of the fact that breakfast was before him and a stranger-guest seated at table. The butler entered with another dish. \"Better go on with your breakfast,\" he whispered to Loveday, \"he may sit like that for another hour.\"\nHe placed his dish in front of his master.\n\"Captain hasn't come back yet, sir,\" he said, making an effort to arouse him from his reverie.\n\"Eh, what?\" said Mr. Craven, for a moment lifting his hand from his eyes.\n\"Captain, sir–the black retriever,\" repeated the man.\nThe pathetic look in Mr. Craven's eyes deepened.\n\"Ah, poor Captain!\" he murmured; \"the best dog I ever had.\"\nThen he again sank back in his chair, putting his hand to his forehead.\nThe butler made one more effort to arouse him.\n\"Madam sent you down a newspaper, sir, that she thought you would like to see,\" he shouted almost into his master's ear, and at the same time laid the morning's paper on the table beside his plate.\nImage of a woman in dark dress (Loveday Brooke) seated across a dining from a man in a suit (Mr. Craven) with a hand clasped over his face. His butler is standing beside him.\nHE LAID THE MORNING'S PAPER BESIDE HIS PLATE.\n\"Confound you! leave it there,\" said Mr. Craven irritably. \"Fools! dolts that you all are! With your trivialities and interruptions you are sending me out of the world with my work undone!\"\nAnd again he sank back in his chair, closed his eyes and became lost to his surroundings.\nLoveday went on with her breakfast. She changed her place at table to one on Mr. Craven's right hand, so that the newspaper sent down for his perusal lay between his plate and hers. It was folded into an oblong shape, as if it were wished to direct attention to a certain portion of a certain column.\nA clock in a corner of the room struck the hour with a loud, resonant stroke. Mr. Craven gave a start and rubbed his eyes.\n\"Eh, what's this?\" he said. \"What meal are we at?\" He looked around with a bewildered air. \"Eh!–who are you?\" he went on, staring hard at Loveday. \"What are you doing here? Where's Nina?–Where's Harry?\"\nLoveday began to explain, and gradually recollection seemed to come back to him.\n\"Ah, yes, yes,\" he said. \"I remember; you've come to assist me with my great work. You promised, you know, to help me out of the hole I've got into. Very enthusiastic, I remember they said you were, on certain abstruse points in comparative philology. Now, Miss–Miss–I've forgotten your name–tell me a little of what you know about the elemental sounds of speech that are common to all languages. Now, to how many would you reduce those elemental sounds–to six, eight, nine? No, we won't discuss the matter here, the cups and saucers distract me. Come into my den at the other end of the house; we'll have perfect quiet there.\"\nAnd utterly ignoring the fact that he had not as yet broken his fast, he rose from the table, seized Loveday by the wrist, and led her out of the room and down the long corridor that led through the south wing to his study.\nBut seated in that study his energy once more speedily exhausted itself.\nHe placed Loveday in a comfortable chair at his writing-table, consulted her taste as to pens, and spread a sheet of foolscap before her. Then he settled himself in his easy-chair, with his back to the light, as if he were about to dictate folios to her.\nIn a loud, distinct voice he repeated the title of his learned work, then its sub-division, then the number and heading of the chapter that was at present engaging his attention. Then he put his hand to his head. \"It's the elemental sounds that are my stumbling-block,\" he said. \"Now, how on earth is it possible to get a notion of a sound of agony that is not in part a sound of terror? or a sound of surprise that is not in part a sound of either joy or sorrow?\"\nWith this his energies were spent, and although Loveday remained seated in that study from early morning till daylight began to fade, she had not ten sentences to show for her day's work as amanuensis.\nLoveday in all spent only two clear days at Troyte's Hill.\nOn the evening of the first of those days Detective Griffiths received, through the trustworthy post-boy, the following brief note from her:\n\"I have found out that Hales owed Sandy close upon a hundred pounds, which he had borrowed at various times. I don't know whether you will think this fact of any importance.–L. B.\"\nMr. Griffiths repeated the last sentence blankly. \"If Harry Craven were put upon his defence, his counsel, I take it, would consider the fact of first importance,\" he muttered. And for the remainder of that day Mr. Griffiths went about his work in a perturbed state of mind, doubtful whether to hold or to let go his theory concerning Harry Craven's guilt.\nThe next morning there came another brief note from Loveday which ran thus:\n\"As a matter of collateral interest, find out if a person, calling himself Harold Cousins, sailed two days ago from London Docks for Natal in the Bonnie Dundee?\"\nTo this missive Loveday received, in reply, the following somewhat lengthy dispatch:\n\"I do not quite see the drift of your last note, but have wired to our agents in London to carry out its suggestion. On my part, I have important news to communicate. I have found out what Harry Craven's business out of doors was on the night of the murder, and at my instance a warrant has been issued for his arrest. This warrant it will be my duty to serve on him in the course of to-day. Things are beginning to look very black against him, and I am convinced his illness is all a sham. I have seen Waters, the man who is supposed to be attending him, and have driven him into a corner and made him admit that he has only seen young Craven once–on the first day of his illness–and that he gave his certificate entirely on the strength of what Mrs. Craven told him of her son's condition. On the occasion of this, his first and only visit, the lady, it seems, also told him that it would not be necessary for him to continue his attendance, as she quite felt herself competent to treat the case, having had so much experience in fever cases among the blacks at Natal.\n\"As I left Waters's house, after eliciting this important information, I was accosted by a man who keeps a low-class inn in the place, McQueen by name. He said that he wished to speak to me on a matter of importance. To make a long story short, this McQueen stated that on the night of the sixth, shortly after eleven o'clock, Harry Craven came to his house, bringing with him a valuable piece of plate–a handsome epergne–and requested him to lend him a hundred pounds on it, as he hadn't a penny in his pocket. McQueen complied with his request to the extent of ten sovereigns, and now, in a fit of nervous terror, comes to me to confess himself a receiver of stolen goods and play the honest man! He says he noticed that the young gentleman was very much agitated as he made the request, and he also begged him to mention his visit to no one. Now, I am curious to learn how Master Harry will get over the fact that he passed the lodge at the hour at which the murder was most probably committed; or how he will get out of the dilemma of having repassed the lodge on his way back to the house, and not noticed the wide-open window with the full moon shining down on it?\n\"Another word! Keep out of the way when I arrive at the house, somewhere between two and three in the afternoon, to serve the warrant. I do not wish your professional capacity to get wind, for you will most likely yet be of some use to us in the house.\n\"S.G.\"\nImage of a man (McQueen) seated by a table full of beer bottles and mugs, in a tavern. He's scowling up at a thin man in a suit with a hand to his face and a hand on the door.\nWANTED A HUNDRED POUNDS.\nLoveday read this note, seated at Mr. Craven's writing-table, with the old gentleman himself reclining motionless beside her in his easy-chair. A little smile played about the corners of her mouth as she read over again the words–\"for you will most likely yet be of some use to us in the house.\"\nLoveday's second day in Mr. Craven's study promised to be as unfruitful as the first. For fully an hour after she had received Griffiths' note, she sat at the writing-table with her pen in her hand, ready to transcribe Mr. Craven's inspirations. Beyond, however, the phrase, muttered with closed eyes–\"It's all here, in my brain, but I can't put it into words\"–not a half-syllable escaped his lips.\nAt the end of that hour the sound of footsteps on the outside gravel made her turn her head towards the window. It was Griffiths approaching with two constables. She heard the hall door opened to admit them, but, beyond that, not a sound reached her ear, and she realized how fully she was cut off from communication with the rest of the household at the farther end of this unoccupied wing.\nMr. Craven, still reclining in his semi-trance, evidently had not the faintest suspicion that so important an event as the arrest of his only son on a charge of murder was about to be enacted in the house.\nMeantime, Griffiths and his constables had mounted the stairs leading to the north wing, and were being guided through the corridors to the sick-room by the flying figure of Moggie, the maid.\n\"Hoot, mistress!\" cried the girl, \"here are three men coming up the stairs–policemen, every one of them–will ye come and ask them what they be wanting?\"\nOutside the door of the sick-room stood Mrs. Craven–a tall, sharp-featured woman with sandy hair going rapidly grey.\n\"What is the meaning of this? What is your business here?\" she said haughtily, addressing Griffiths, who headed the party.\nGriffiths respectfully explained what his business was, and requested her to stand on one side that he might enter her son's room.\n\"This is my daughter's room; satisfy yourself of the fact,\" said the lady, throwing back the door as she spoke.\nAnd Griffiths and his confrères entered, to find pretty Miss Craven, looking very white and scared, seated beside a fire in a long flowing robe de chambre.\nImage of a woman (Miss Craven) slumped over on a chair, looking up plaintively.\nMISS CRAVEN LOOKING VERY WHITE AND SCARED.\nGriffiths departed in haste and confusion, without the chance of a professional talk with Loveday. That afternoon saw him telegraphing wildly in all directions, and dispatching messengers in all quarters. Finally he spent over an hour drawing up an elaborate report to his chief at Newcastle, assuring him of the identity of one, Harold Cousins, who had sailed in the Bonnie Dundee for Natal, with Harry Craven, of Troyte's Hill, and advising that the police authorities in that far-away district should be immediately communicated with.\n\n\nProvide a comprehensive summary (between 600 and 900 words long) of the key events, information, and important details from this document."

    "final_summary": "\"The Murder at Troyte's Hill\" unfolds as a complex detective story centered around the mysterious death of Alexander \"old Sandy\" Henderson, the lodge-keeper at Troyte's Hill, a deteriorating estate in Cumberland. The investigation is jointly handled by Griffiths of the Newcastle Constabulary—characterized as a keen and methodical detective—and the sharp-witted Miss Loveday Brooke, who is brought in as an amanuensis and unofficial assistant to delve deeper into the nuances of the case.\n\nThe narrative begins with Mr. Dyer briefing Miss Brooke on the case details. Old Sandy, a solitary lodge-keeper living alone in a two-room lodge at the estate, was found dead on the morning of September 6th. His death was discovered by local children who noticed his bedroom window wide open and his body lying on the floor in his nightshirt, evidently having fallen backward from the window. The cause of death was a heavy blow to the temple, likely from a fist or a blunt object. The crime scene was chaotic—furniture overturned, bedclothes stuffed into the chimney, a clock placed upside-down, and ornaments lined up as if “walking” toward the door. Despite this disarray, the cupboard where Sandy kept his savings was untouched, suggesting robbery was not the motive.\n\nThe inquest returned a verdict of willful murder by an unknown assailant. Public speculation leaned toward the possibility of a crazed lunatic or an escaped asylum inmate, but Detective Griffiths harbored strong suspicions against the lord of the estate’s family, especially young Mr. Harry Craven.\n\nThe Craven family dynamic is crucial. Mr. Craven senior, a scholarly, somewhat reclusive philologist focused on an extensive work on comparative philology, inherited the estate after his brother’s death but struggled to maintain the household and funded his children’s education sparingly. The family consisted of Mr. Craven, his wife (a quiet woman with a missionary background), their daughter Nina, and their son Harry—a wayward young man described as a gentleman-blackleg and morally dubious character. Harry’s health was suspiciously poor; he was absent from the inquest on a doctor’s certificate for typhoid fever, though Griffiths suspected the illness may be feigned.\n\nTensions between old Sandy and young Harry were notable. Griffiths explained that since the Craven family took possession of Troyte’s Hill, Harry had openly defied Sandy’s authority, culminating in a violent confrontation the day before the murder—a scene witnessed by several people where Harry threatened Sandy’s life. In contrast, the butler, John Hales, was regarded as respectable and above suspicion despite his obvious disdain for Sandy, who had earned the servants’ dislike by wielding disproportionate influence over their master and disturbing the household hierarchy—his salary was so high it had caused the butler’s wages to be cut.\n\nGriffiths’ theory suggested Harry murdered Sandy in cold blood. Harry was known to have left the house briefly on the night of the murder, around 10 pm, coinciding with the medical evidence that placed Sandy’s death between 10 and 11 pm. No one could account for his whereabouts until later that night, and it was suspicious that Harry returned to the house reportedly carrying a valuable piece of silverware, which he pawned at a low-class inn for cash. The local police were pursuing the matter, preparing to arrest Harry.\n\nMiss Brooke is introduced into the household under the guise of helping Mr. Craven with his philological work at a very modest salary, facilitating her discreet investigation. On arriving at Troyte’s Hill, she observes the rundown condition of the property, illustrating the Cravens’ financial struggles. She meets John Hales and the cook, who reluctantly accommodate her. Loveday also visits Sandy’s lodge, confirming its graveled surroundings and disuse, and stumbles upon the dead body of Captain, the Cravens’ black retriever, hidden among shrubbery and similarly struck dead by a blunt instrument, paralleling Sandy’s violent end.\n\nInside the house, Loveday meets Mr. Craven senior, who is a handsome but emotionally fragile man, often lost in thought and overwhelmed by the magnitude of his scholarly labors. His demeanor oscillates between energetic bursts and long periods of collapse into a trance-like state. He shows some interest in Loveday’s work but struggles to articulate his thoughts, demanding perfect quiet to compose his treatise. His distracted behavior contrasts strikingly with the underlying tension of the ongoing murder case.\n\nWhile Loveday attempts to settle into the role of amanuensis, she investigates the household discreetly. She uncovers that the butler, Hales, owed Sandy nearly a hundred pounds, a fact that adds another layer of complexity to household relations and potential motives. Loveday’s communication with Griffiths is crucial; she sends him updates through a trustworthy post-boy, and their correspondence reveals further leads and suspicions.\n\nGriffiths’ diligence pays off when he discovers that Harry Craven’s illness is likely a sham. The attending doctor, Waters, admits he saw Harry only once and issued his certificate based solely on Mrs. Craven’s word. Mrs. Craven, experienced in medical care from her missionary work in Natal, insisted she could manage Harry’s care alone, which allowed them to avoid closer medical scrutiny. Meanwhile, several household servants fled out of fear of contagion, and Nina Craven was sent away with a maid to Newcastle.\n\nFurthermore, on the night of the murder, Harry was seen pawning a valuable silver epergne for money at an inn. McQueen, the innkeeper, later approaches Griffiths, fearful of legal repercussions for his unwitting involvement as a receiver of stolen goods. This transaction places Harry near financial desperation and contributes to the mounting suspicion.\n\nThe climax of the narrative excerpt is Griffiths’ arrival at Troyte’s Hill with constables to arrest Harry. This unfolds without Harry or his family’s awareness; the household is starkly divided, with Mrs. Craven and Nina isolated due to the supposed fever and the rest seemingly unprepared for the abrupt turn of events. Griffiths’ final move includes telegraphing authorities in Natal about an individual named Harold Cousins, suggesting possible flight plans or connections abroad.\n\nIn summary, \"The Murder at Troyte's Hill\" intricately weaves together a closed-circle murder mystery centered on household tensions, financial strain, and conflicting personalities within the Craven estate. The death of a long-standing servant under suspicious circumstances reveals underlying fractures in the family and servants' relations, with young Harry Craven emerging as the prime suspect due to motive, opportunity, and suspicious behavior. The presence of a knowledgeable and determined female investigator, Loveday Brooke, working alongside Detective Griffiths, adds a modern investigative dimension. The story unfolds amid an atmosphere of decay—both physical in the failing estate and moral in the family's secrets—setting a compelling scene for the pursuit of justice.",
