    "full_text": "In \"The Bacteriological Detective,\" a captivating detective narrative blending bacteriological science with traditional sleuthing, Professor Kennedy and narrator Jameson investigate a mysterious typhoid fever outbreak at the Bisbee estate, centered on the recent death of oil magnate Jim Bisbee and the suspicious amendment of his will. The story, set against the backdrop of early scientific advancements and forensic techniques, explores the sinister possibility of weaponized bacteria employed to advance a convoluted inheritance scheme.\n\nThe investigation begins when Eveline Bisbee, Jim’s young ward and expected heiress, approaches Kennedy and Jameson with fears that the persistent typhoid outbreak at Bisbee Hall was no mere accident but a deliberate act. The outbreak, initially puzzling due to the estate’s otherwise antiseptic and self-contained environment—including heavy reliance on bottled mountain spring water rather than local sources—appeared targeted and unrelenting. Further complicating the situation was the new will, which redirected Jim’s fortune from Eveline to a new trust for a mechanical arts school, with lawyer James Denny as trustee. The will’s clause stipulated that if Eveline died heirless, the full estate would ultimately pass to this trust, raising motives for malfeasance.\n\nKennedy, a bacteriologist versed in modern science and investigative rigor, connects natural disease theories with the possibility of human conspiracy. After confirming the official diagnosis and examining Jim Bisbee’s medical records, they traverse to the estate and nearby town to gather intelligence and samples. Jameson canvasses local newspapers and contacts, determining that typhoid cases elsewhere in the region do not relate to the estate’s outbreak, making Bisbee Hall the unique epicenter.\n\nAt the estate, Kennedy meticulously sets up a mobile laboratory to test every conceivable source of infection—estate water, milk, and food supplies—all returning negative for typhoid bacilli. Crucially, the estate relied on bottled mountain spring water transported from New York camps, and these sealed full bottles tested entirely clean. This shifts Kennedy’s attention to the emptied bottles, previously sent to the freight depot. A breakthrough comes when Kennedy swabs the inside surfaces of the used bottles, cultivating bacterial colonies, and simultaneously searches for latent fingerprints on the bottle surfaces using a mercury and chalk powder technique. The forensic fingerprinting reveals prints on the bottles’ exteriors, but comparison with the fingerprints of all current estate servants shows no match, suggesting a hidden or departed individual’s involvement.\n\nIn this final segment, the story deepens its suspense as these unanswered questions prompt an urgent return to New York. Interviewing Mrs. Rawson, the housekeeper, Kennedy and Jameson learn that only one domestic, a cook named Bridget Fallon, had recently left the estate. Bridget is described as unreliable and frequently intoxicated after the typhoid outbreak began. Her prior employment was with the Caswell-Jones family at Shelter Island, validated by a letter of recommendation that Kennedy secures for further investigation. Meanwhile, Bridget had control over the storage of the spring water bottles in the estate kitchen, and during the outbreak only one guest, the lawyer James Denny, visited the estate briefly.\n\nKennedy’s realization—that Bridget Fallon’s recent departure and direct contact with the implicated bottles could be pivotal—ushers the investigation into its critical phase. The team hurries back to New York, reaching the police headquarters where Inspector Barney O'Connor eagerly commits his resources and cooperation. Kennedy anticipates a dramatic resolution and enlists O'Connor’s men to retrieve the original will from the surrogate’s office, locate and fingerprint James Denny and Bridget Fallon, and hold Bridget if necessary to prevent her disappearance.\n\nFurther networking takes place at the Department of Health, where Jameson seeks information on Bridget from the commissioner, Dr. Leslie. The commissioner becomes so intrigued by the case that he requests to attend the impending final confrontation, signaling the investigation’s seriousness and intertwining public health authority with criminal justice. Kennedy arranges a gathering at the police laboratory later that evening involving all principal figures, including Miss Bisbee, the health commissioner, and law enforcement officials.\n\nThe story’s suspense intensifies as the prepared scientific and forensic evidences converge toward unveiling the hidden conspirator exploiting their bacteriological knowledge to try to murder Eveline and seize the fortune through a scheme disguised as disease. Kennedy’s blend of bacteriology, fingerprint analysis, and classic detective work stands at the forefront, demonstrating the evolution of detective methodology in the face of modern microbial threat.\n\nOverall, \"The Bacteriological Detective\" unfolds as a pioneering crime narrative where invisible microbial agents become tools of murder, inheritance intrigue complicates motives, and scientific method complements detective intuition.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Eveline Bisbee: She already expected to inherit under the old will, so the new will harms her; she gains nothing from spreading typhoid that endangers her own life.  \n   • Mrs. Rawson (housekeeper) & the ordinary servants: no financial stake and, if the estate were ruined, they would lose employment.  \n   • Bridget Fallon (cook who left): no obvious claim on the Bisbee fortune.  \n   • James Denny (lawyer): drew up the new will, is sole trustee of the large trust, and if Eveline should die childless the entire fortune would pass into the trust he controls. That prospect gives him a huge indirect financial interest and a clear motive to remove Eveline.  \n\n2. Opportunity  \n   • The infection vector is the INSIDE of the emptied spring-water bottles. Only someone who could get at those bottles between the time they were emptied and the time they were shipped away could seed them with typhoid.   \n   • The servants handled the bottles continually, so their prints should have been on them—yet none matched. That eliminates all current servants (and Mrs. Rawson).  \n   • Bridget handled the bottles while she worked there, but left midway through the outbreak. She therefore had the opportunity, but her prints would be found if she had done it. They were not.  \n   • There was only one outsider who had physical access during the relevant period: James Denny, the visiting lawyer. He was present for a short time, long enough to step into the kitchen–storeroom area Bridget supervised, seed several empties, and leave.  \n\n3. Physical evidence / alibis  \n   • Typhoid bacilli grew only from swabs taken inside the returned bottles.  \n   • Latent fingerprints developed on the bottles did not match any employee still on the estate.  \n   • Once Inspector O’Connor obtains comparison prints from the suspects, the unmatched set will correspond to James Denny’s fingers.  \n   • Bridget can account for herself at the times Denny was storing the culture; moreover, the commissioner of health can pull her past employment health record, showing no history of typhoid carrier status.  \n   • Denny had easy laboratory access in New York and, as a clever lawyer, understood how to culture bacteria and transport a small vial unnoticed.  \n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   a) Disease source = contaminated emptied water bottles.  \n   b) Fingerprints on bottles ≠ any servant → culprit is NOT a current employee.  \n   c) Only outsiders with access: Bridget (left) and Denny (visitor).  \n   d) Bridget’s motive is nonexistent; Denny’s is overwhelming.  \n   e) Bridget’s prints will not match; Denny’s will.  \n   Therefore Denny must be the one who planted the typhoid bacilli.  \n\nConclusion: James Denny is the bacteriological murderer; no accomplice is proven—Bridget was merely convenience and perhaps a red-herring.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJames Denny, Bridget Fallon, Mrs. Rawson, Eveline Bisbee, estate servants (footmen, maids), unknown outsider\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJames Denny\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter persuading the aging Jim Bisbee to sign a new will, attorney James Denny inserted himself as trustee of a large charitable trust that would ultimately receive the whole Bisbee fortune if young Eveline died without heirs.  To hasten that end, Denny cultured virulent typhoid bacilli in his New York office.\n\nWhen he paid his single “friendly” visit to Bisbee Hall he brought a small vial of the culture.  Under the pretext of chatting with the cook in the kitchen, he slipped into the storeroom where the household stacked the just-emptied spring-water bottles awaiting shipment back to the bottler.  Opening each bottle, he poured in a few drops of the living culture, stoppered the bottles loosely, and replaced them on the rack.\n\nBack upstairs he made a short social call and departed.  Meanwhile the servants, not suspecting anything, carted off the contaminated empties; the tiny residue of infected fluid mixed with the estate’s dishes, ice-water pitchers, and cooking utensils, starting a chain of typhoid cases.  Jim Bisbee, already weakened, died first; others, including Eveline, fell ill but survived.\n\nBecause no local water, milk, or food tested positive, Kennedy focused on the empties.  He found colonies of typhoid bacilli inside them and an unfamiliar set of fingerprints outside.  When the prints were later compared with samples from everyone involved, they proved to be James Denny’s.  His motive, opportunity, and the exclusive physical evidence converge, exposing him as the man who weaponized bacteria to change the course of an inheritance.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Bridget Fallon: Though she had access to the bottles, her fingerprints are absent.  No financial motive connects her to Eveline’s death, and her health records show she is not a typhoid carrier.  Her flight was fear of being blamed, not guilt.  \n• Mrs. Rawson and the remaining servants: Their prints do not match, they had no motive, and they continued caring for the sick at risk to themselves.  \n• Eveline Bisbee: As intended victim and patient, she clearly gained nothing from the plot.  \n• Any outside carrier: No other outsider had the opportunity to handle the bottles inside the secure estate during the critical window except James Denny.  \n\nAccordingly, all evidence exonerates these individuals and points uniquely to the trustee, James Denny.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Who did not know that \"Jim\" Bisbee, the southern California oil-magnate, had died suddenly of typhoid fever at the private hospital of Dr. Bell, where he had been taken from his magnificent apartment on Riverside Drive? Kennedy and I had discussed it at the time. We had commented on the artificiality of the twentieth century. No longer did people have homes; they had apartments, I had said. They didn't fall ill in the good old-fashioned way any more, either in fact, they even hired special rooms to die in. They hired halls for funeral services. It was a wonder that they didn't hire graves. It was all part of our twentieth century break-up of tradition. Indeed we did know about the death of Jim Bisbee. But there was nothing mysterious about it. It was just typical in all its surroundings of the first decade of the twentieth century in a great, artificial city—a lonely death of a great man surrounded by all that money could buy.\n\nWe had read of his ward, too, the beautiful Miss Eveline Bisbee, a distant relation.

At least, I am sure that even Kennedy had by this time completely forgotten the lecture on toxins.\n\n\"There is something about my guardian's death,\" she began in a low and tremulous voice, \"that I am sure will bear investigating. It may be only a woman's foolish fears, but—I haven't told this to a soul till now, except Mrs. Fletcher. My guardian had, as you perhaps know, spent his summer at his country place at Bisbee Hall, New Jersey, from which he returned rather suddenly about a week ago. Our friends thought it merely a strange whim that he should return to the city before the summer was fairly over, but it was not. The day before he returned, his gardener fell sick of typhoid.

When I am hungry I simply steal out to a hotel—a different one every time. I never drink any water except that which I have surreptitiously boiled in my own room over a gas-stove. Disinfectants and germicides have been used by the gallon, and still I don't feel safe. Even the health authorities don't remove my fears. With my guardian's death I had begun to feel that possibly it was over. But no.

        "summary": "The opening segment of \"The Bacteriological Detective\" introduces readers to two central characters, Professor Kennedy and the narrator, Mr. Jameson, whose dynamic provides the foundation for the ensuing mystery. Kennedy is deeply engrossed in preparing a lecture concerning the chemical makeup of bacterial toxins and antitoxins—a topic that is highly specialized and somewhat arcane, especially to Jameson, who candidly admits his unfamiliarity with it. This scene effectively establishes Kennedy as a figure of scientific expertise, familiar with complex biochemical concepts in the same way that the city streets are familiar to a seasoned local. His absorption in the subject suggests the story will hinge on scientific knowledge, particularly relating to bacteria and toxins, a theme not typically emphasized in detective fiction of the period.\n\nDuring this moment of intellectual labor, the two men engage in a lively conversation highlighting the contrast between conventional criminal methods and the underexplored potential of scientific or chemical sophistication in crime. Kennedy muses, somewhat philosophically, on how modern criminals miss opportunities by relying on outdated or crude methods—firearms, chloroform, or prussic acid—when there exists a far more refined arsenal of tools rooted in science, such as bacterial toxins and biological agents. Jameson, approaching the subject from the perspective of a newspaperman, regards this scientific angle as lacking the dramatic flair needed for sensational journalism. He jokes that crime involving germs and antitoxins lacks the exciting elements—gunshots, violent confrontations—that make a thrilling news story, branding such cases as unsuitable for the \"yellow journals\" where stories must captivate readers with clear-cut action.\n\nDespite Jameson's skepticism, Kennedy insists that the application of biological agents would be far more clever and, indeed, dramatically potent, implying a cerebral dimension to crime that transcends the ordinary and violent. This brief intellectual exchange not only characterizes the two men’s professional outlooks but also neatly foreshadows the direction of the mystery, framing the investigation around biological and chemical phenomena rather than mere physical evidence or straightforward violence. The conversation also hints at Kennedy’s belief in the evolution of crime paralleling advances in science.\n\nShortly after this discussion, the narrative shifts abruptly with the ringing of the hall door buzzer, introducing a new character who drives the plot forward—a young woman named Eveline Bisbee. She arrives at the apartment heavily veiled and nearly hysterical, underscoring her anxiety and distress. Eveline is initially uncertain and somewhat desperate, searching for Professor Kennedy in hopes of finding help. Her manner and circumstances immediately convey urgency and a plea for assistance, engaging both the reader’s and characters’ interest.\n\nKennedy receives her with polite calmness and invites her to explain her plight, while the narrator prepares himself to step away out of respect for privacy but is soon persuaded to stay when Eveline mentions that both Kennedy and Jameson are reputed to work closely together. This moment solidifies their roles as partners, blending scientific acumen with investigative savvy.\n\nEveline then reveals the core mystery: the recent death of her guardian, \"Jim\" Bisbee, a well-known southern California oil magnate. The story of Bisbee’s death would have been familiar to contemporary readers of the time, as it involved sudden typhoid fever contracted in a private New York hospital. Kennedy and Jameson had themselves previously discussed the death as emblematic of the artificial modern urban lifestyle—highlighting how the wealthy manage illness and death with clinical detachment, using rented hospital rooms and impersonal apartments, stripping away human warmth and tradition.\n\nDespite this grim but conventional background, Eveline’s story reveals troubling irregularities. Her guardian had abruptly ended his summer stay at his country estate, Bisbee Hall in New Jersey, after the gardener there fell ill with typhoid fever—an unusual and alarming event. This prompted a quick return to the city. However, typhoid continued to spread in an alarming sequence; after the gardener’s illness, the valet in their city apartment also fell sick. Following that, a succession of Bisbee Hall’s servants contracted the disease, five in total, all stricken in quick succession. Finally came the most devastating blow: Jim Bisbee himself succumbed to typhoid fever in New York City.\n\nWhat deeply unnerves Eveline—beyond the tragic loss—is the apparent inescapability of the disease. Despite her extreme precautions to avoid infection—ditching the apartment for different hotels, boiling water herself, and employing disinfectants liberally—she remains gripped by fear. The disease did not stay confined to the country estate but pursued them into the city, breaking the assumption that relocation and sanitation alone could stop its spread. This persistence suggests that more is at play than a mere outbreak of typical typhoid; there is a hint of underlying mystery, perhaps something deliberate or unnatural about how the disease has targeted the Bisbee household and now threatens Eveline herself.\n\nEveline’s hesitation to share her fears beyond a trusted friend, Mrs. Fletcher of Great Neck, indicates a lack of faith in official health authorities. Their reassurances have failed to alleviate her dread, implying either incompetence or a concealed truth about the epidemic’s origins. Her visit to Kennedy and Jameson underscores her desperation to find someone capable of unraveling the mystery with expertise that goes beyond routine medical or police investigation—someone who can deal with the scientific and possibly criminal dimensions of the case.\n\nThis segment closes on an ominous note, with Eveline’s question lingering in the air: why hasn’t the disease stopped with the estate, and why does the threat continue unabated in New York? The underlying suggestion is that this may be no ordinary case of typhoid or accident of infection but rather a deliberate act with a hidden design, calling for the expert and unconventional methods that Kennedy’s bacteriological knowledge might provide.\n\nIn sum, this first segment establishes the scientific and investigative framework of the story, introduces key characters and their expertise, and sets up a chilling medical mystery linked to a high-profile and potentially sinister case of typhoid fever. It balances intellectual discourse on criminal methodology with emotional and narrative tension, preparing the reader for a detective story where biology and bacteriology intersect with crime, suspicion, and the quest for truth."

As I listened I felt how terrible it must be to be pursued by such a fear. What must it be to be dogged by a disease as relentlessly as the typhoid had dogged her? If it had been some great, but visible, tangible peril how gladly I could have faced it merely for the smile of a woman like this. But it was a peril that only knowledge and patience could meet. Instinctively I turned toward Kennedy, my own mind being an absolute blank.\n\n\"Is there anyone you suspect of being the cause of such an epidemic?\" he asked. \"I may as well tell you right now that I have already formed two theories—one perfectly natural, the other diabolical.

Of course, I do not know much about my guardian's interests while he was alive, but it strikes me as strange that he should have changed so radically, and, besides, the new will is so worded that if I die without children my million also goes to this school—location unnamed. I can't help wondering about it all.\"\n\n\"Why should you wonder—at least what other reasons have you for wondering?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't express them. Maybe after all it's only a woman's silly intuition. But often I have thought in the past few days about this illness of my guardian. It was so queer. He was always so careful. And you know the rich don't often have typhoid.\"\n\n\"You have no reason to suppose that it was not typhoid fever of which he died?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"No,\" she replied, \"but if you had known Mr. Bisbee you would think it strange, too. He had a horror of infectious and contagious diseases. His apartment and his country home were models. No sanitarium could have been more punctilious.

Then he suddenly jumped up. \"Walter,\" he said, \"let us go over to Dr. Bell's. I know the head nurse there. We may possibly learn something.\"\n\n\nAS we sat in the waiting-room with its thick Oriental rugs and handsome mahogany furniture, I found myself going back to our conversation of the early evening. \"By Jove, Kennedy, you were right,\" I exclaimed. \"If there is anything in this germ-plot idea of hers it is indeed the height of the dramatic—it is diabolical. No ordinary mortal would ever be capable of it.\"\n\nJust then the head nurse came in, a large woman breathing of germlessness and cheerfulness in her spotless uniform. We were shown every courtesy. There was, in fact, nothing to conceal. The visit set at rest my last suspicion that perhaps Jim Bisbee had been poisoned by a drug. The charts of his temperature and the sincerity of the nurse were absolutely convincing. It had really been typhoid, and there was nothing to be gained by pursuing that inquiry further.\n\nBack at the apartment, Craig began packing his suitcase with the few things he would need for a journey. \"I'm going out to Bisbee Hall to-morrow for a few days, Walter, and if you could find it convenient to come along I should like to have your assistance.\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, Craig, I am afraid to go,\" I said.\n\n\"You needn't be. I'm going down to the army post on Governor's Island first to be vaccinated against typhoid. Then I am going to wait a few hours till it takes effect before going.

While three inoculations are really best, I understand that one is sufficient for ordinary protection, and that is all we shall need, if any.\"\n\n\"You're sure of it?\"\n\n\"Almost positive.\"\n\n\"Very well, Craig. I'll go.\"\n\nDown at the army post the next morning we had no difficulty in being inoculated against the disease. The work of immunising our army was going on at that time, and several thousands of soldiers in various parts of the country had already been vaccinated, with the best of results. \"Do many civilians come over to be vaccinated?\" asked Craig of Major Carroll, the surgeon in charge.\n\n\"Not many, for very few have heard of it,\" he replied.\n\n\"I suppose you keep a record of them.\"\n\n\"Only their names—we can't follow them up outside the army, to see how it works. Still, when they come to us as you and Mr. Jameson have done we are perfectly willing to vaccinate them. The Army Medical Corps takes the position that if it is good for the army it is good for civil life, and as long as only a few civilians apply we are perfectly willing to do it for a fee covering the cost.\"\n\n\"And would you let me see the list?\"\n\n\"Certainly. You may look it over in a moment.\"\n\nKennedy glanced hurriedly through the short list of names, pulled out his notebook, made an entry, and handed the list back. \"Thank you, Major.\"",

Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-1):\nThe opening segment of \"The Bacteriological Detective\" introduces readers to two central characters, Professor Kennedy and the narrator, Mr. Jameson, whose dynamic provides the foundation for the ensuing mystery. Kennedy is deeply engrossed in preparing a lecture concerning the chemical makeup of bacterial toxins and antitoxins—a topic that is highly specialized and somewhat arcane, especially to Jameson, who candidly admits his unfamiliarity with it. This scene effectively establishes Kennedy as a figure of scientific expertise, familiar with complex biochemical concepts in the same way that the city streets are familiar to a seasoned local. His absorption in the subject suggests the story will hinge on scientific knowledge, particularly relating to bacteria and toxins, a theme not typically emphasized in detective fiction of the period.\n\nDuring this moment of intellectual labor, the two men engage in a lively conversation highlighting the contrast between conventional criminal methods and the underexplored potential of scientific or chemical sophistication in crime. Kennedy muses, somewhat philosophically, on how modern criminals miss opportunities by relying on outdated or crude methods—firearms, chloroform, or prussic acid—when there exists a far more refined arsenal of tools rooted in science, such as bacterial toxins and biological agents. Jameson, approaching the subject from the perspective of a newspaperman, regards this scientific angle as lacking the dramatic flair needed for sensational journalism. He jokes that crime involving germs and antitoxins lacks the exciting elements—gunshots, violent confrontations—that make a thrilling news story, branding such cases as unsuitable for the \"yellow journals\" where stories must captivate readers with clear-cut action.\n\nDespite Jameson's skepticism, Kennedy insists that the application of biological agents would be far more clever and, indeed, dramatically potent, implying a cerebral dimension to crime that transcends the ordinary and violent.

        "summary": "In the unfolding detective story \"The Bacteriological Detective,\" Professor Kennedy and the narrator, Mr. Jameson, serve as the intellectual and observational duo at the heart of a gripping mystery rooted in bacteriology and criminal intrigue. The narrative begins with these two men discussing the intersection of science and crime, particularly the untapped potential of using biological agents—such as bacterial toxins—as instruments of criminal activity. Kennedy, a figure of scientific depth, contemplates how the evolution of criminal methods might parallel advances in science, musings that lay the groundwork for the case that challenges their combined expertise.\n\nTheir conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Eveline Bisbee, a distressed and veiled young woman who seeks Kennedy’s help with a troubling and ultimately chilling problem involving her late guardian, \"Jim\" Bisbee, a wealthy southern California oil magnate. Eveline’s account reveals a grim chronicle of typhoid fever outbreaks beginning at the Bisbee estate in New Jersey and persisting into the city, ultimately claiming the life of Jim Bisbee despite his scrupulously antiseptic lifestyle. This scenario immediately casts suspicion on the natural course of disease spread and suggests something more sinister than mere chance—a clue that the illness’s tenacity might point to deliberate human design.\n\nEveline’s aunt’s fears intensify when she learns that a new will shifts her expected inheritance of one million dollars into a trust fund benefiting the Bisbee School of Mechanical Arts, with the trustee being the lawyer James Denny. Moreover, this new will is worded so that if Eveline dies without heirs, the fortune also merges into this fund. This legal maneuver, coupled with the unnatural sequence of infections, plants the seed of doubt and suspicion in Eveline’s mind; she senses that her guardian’s untimely demise and the deadly disease stalking her family may not be accidents but possibly linked to greed and malicious intent.\n\nKennedy’s approach to Eveline’s plight is methodical and calm. He encourages her to share every detail and reveals that he already has two theories circulating in his mind—one ordinary and natural, the other “diabolical.” He promises to investigate thoroughly, beginning with a quiet trip to Bisbee Hall itself. Eveline’s silent, grateful farewell underscores not only the emotional weight of her predicament but the hope she places in these men who blend scientific rigor with detective acumen.\n\nFollowing Eveline’s departure, Kennedy and Jameson proceed immediately to Dr. Bell’s hospital, specifically to speak with the head nurse who attends to Jim Bisbee’s case. Their visit confirms through detailed charts and sincere testimony that Bisbee did indeed suffer from genuine typhoid fever, effectively ruling out poisoning by drugs or more conventional criminal methods. This finding, while reassuring in confirming the diagnosis, deepens the mysterious context: if it was truly typhoid, how did the disease manage to permeate environments so strictly protected against infection?\n\nMeanwhile, preparations begin for the investigative journey to Bisbee Hall. Kennedy, demonstrating a sense of cautious pragmatism, decides to receive inoculation against typhoid at the army post on Governor’s Island. He acknowledges that while three inoculations provide optimal immunity, a single dose offers practical protection sufficient for their brief fieldwork. Jameson expresses trepidation about the trip, but Kennedy’s resolve—and the measure of scientific precaution through vaccination—persuades him to accompany the professor.\n\nAt the army post, Kennedy’s engagement with the Major in charge reveals a broader public health context: vaccination against typhoid is standard among soldiers but remains little known among civilians. The Major notes that civilian vaccinations are rare due to general unawareness and that the Army Medical Corps welcomes such inoculations as a civic good, though they have limited means to track efficacy outside the military population. Kennedy quickly examines the existing civilian vaccination records, taking note of the names before returning the list, signaling his intent to analyze all possible leads in the tangled web of this epidemic.\n\nThis segment deepens the story’s narrative in multiple ways. Eveline’s fears extend beyond emotional distress into a tangible suspicion of foul play motivated by inheritance and greed. The legal change in Jim Bisbee’s will adds a layer of motive and opportunity, suggesting that someone close to the family—possibly even the attorney entrusted with the Bisbee estate—stands to benefit significantly if Eveline were to perish. Meanwhile, the scientific investigation gains traction as Kennedy and Jameson take concrete steps toward uncovering the truth: obtaining vaccination, visiting institutions involved, and setting out for the estate ground zero of the typhoid outbreak.\n\nThe story maintains a potent atmosphere of invisible menace—the bacteriological threat is relentless, intangible, and terrifying—heightening the psychological tension surrounding Eveline’s plight. The juxtaposition of scientific certainty (vaccinations, medical charts) with the inscrutable spread of disease in supposedly sanitized environments fuels the mystery’s central question: is this a natural outbreak, or has someone weaponized microbiology to perpetrate murder disguised as illness?\n\nThe narrative also highlights the contrasting perspectives of the protagonists. Jameson, the newspaperman, admits to fear and skepticism but gradually submits to Kennedy’s steady scientific confidence and insistence on methodical investigation. Kennedy, in turn, embodies a new kind of detective figure—one where knowledge of bacteriology replaces the traditional reliance on physical evidence or brute force, reflecting an evolution in crime detection suited to the modern age.\n\nIn summary, this second installment of \"The Bacteriological Detective\" builds substantially on the initial setup. The mysterious typhoid fever epidemic that devastated the Bisbee household is not just a medical puzzle but an entanglement of human motives, legal intrigue, and scientific investigation. Eveline Bisbee’s compelling narrative introduces an inheritance dispute shadowed by the deadly disease, prompting Kennedy and Jameson to embark on a perilous and intellectually challenging inquiry. Their visit to Dr. Bell’s hospital confirms the authenticity of the medical symptoms, while inoculation and preparation for the journey to Bisbee Hall signal their commitment to confronting the hidden, biological menace. This segment heightens the story’s tension and foreshadows an unfolding drama where bacteriology and detective work meld to confront a diabolical crime veiled behind the invisible hand of disease."

        "chunk_text": "BISBEE HALL was a splendid place set in the heart of a great park whose area was measured by square miles rather than by acres. But Craig did not propose to stay there, for he arranged for accommodations in a near-by town, where we were to take our meals also. It was late when we arrived, and we spent a restless night, for the inoculation \"took.\" It wasn't any worse than a light attack of the grippe, and in the morning we were both all right again, after the passing of what is called the \"negative phase.\" I, for one, felt much safer.\n\nThe town was very much excited over the epidemic at the hall, and if I had been wondering why Craig wanted me along my wonder was soon set at rest. He had me scouring the town and country looking up every case or rumour of typhoid for miles around. I made the local weekly paper my headquarters, and the editor was very obliging. He let me read all his news letters from his local correspondent at every crossroads. I waded through accounts of new calves and colts, new fences and barns, who \"Sundayed\" with his brother, etc., and soon had a list of all the cases in that part of the country. It was not a long one, but it was scattered. After I had traced them out, following Kennedy's instructions, they showed nothing, except that they were unrelated to the epidemic at the hall.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy was very busy there. He had a microscope and slides and test-tubes and chemicals for testing things, and I don't know what all, for there was not time to initiate me into all the mysteries. He tested the water from the various driven wells and in the water-tank, and the milk from the cows;—he tried to find out what food had come in from outside, though there was practically none, for the hall was self-supporting. There was no stone he left unturned.\n\nWhen I rejoined him that night he was clearly perplexed. I don't think my report decreased his perplexity, either.\n\n\"There is only one thing left as far as I have been able to discover after one day's work,\" he said, after we had gone over our activities for the day. \"Jim Bisbee never drank the water from his own wells. He always drank a bottled water shipped down from a camp of his in New York State, where he had a remarkable mountain spring. I tested a number of the full bottles at the hall, but they were perfectly pure. There wasn't a trace of the bacillus typhosus in any of them. Then it occurred to me that, after all, that was not the thing to do. I should test the empty ones. But there weren't any empty ones. They told me they had all been taken down to the freight station yesterday to be shipped back to the camp. I hope they haven't gone yet. Let's drive around and see if they are there.\"\n\nThe freight-master was just leaving, but when he learned we were from the hall he consented to let us examine the bottles. They were corked and in wooden cases, which protected them perfectly. By the light of the station lamps and the aid of a pocket-lens, Kennedy examined them on the outside and satisfied himself that after being replaced in the wooden cases the bottles themselves had not been handled.\n\n\"Will you let me borrow some of these bottles to-night\" he asked the agent. \"I'll give you my word that they will be returned safely to-morrow. If necessary, I'll get an order for them.\"\n\nThe station-agent reluctantly yielded; especially as a small green banknote figured in the transaction. Craig and I tenderly lifted the big bottles in their cases into our trap and drove back to our rooms in the hotel. It quite excited the hangers-on to see us drive up with a lot of empty five-gallon bottles and carry them up-stairs, but I had long ago given up having any fear of public opinion in carrying out anything Craig wanted.\n\nIn our room we worked far into the night. Craig carefully swabbed out the bottom and sides of each bottle by inserting a little piece of cotton on the end of a long wire. Then he squeezed the water out of the cotton swab on small glass slides coated with agar-agar, or Japanese seaweed, a medium in which germ-cultures multiply rapidly. He put the slides away in a little oven with an alcohol-lamp which he had brought along, leaving them to remain overnight at blood heat.\n\nI had noticed all this time that he was very particular not to touch any of the bottles on the outside. As for me, I wouldn't have touched them for the world. In fact, I was getting so I hesitated to touch anything. I was almost afraid to breathe, though I knew there was no harm in that. However, it was not danger of infection in touching the bottles that made Craig so careful. He had noted, in the dim light of the station lamps, what seemed to be finger-marks on the bottles, and they had interested him, in fact, had decided him on a further investigation of the bottles.\n\n\"I am now going to bring out these very faint finger-prints on the bottles,\" remarked Craig, proceeding with his examination in the better light of our room. \"Here is some powder known to chemists as 'grey powder'—mercury and chalk. I sprinkle it over the faint markings, so, and then I brush it off with a camel's-hair brush lightly. That brings out the imprint much more clearly, as you can see. For instance, if you place your dry thumb on a piece of white paper you leave no visible impression. If grey powder is sprinkled over the spot and then brushed off a distinct impression is seen. If the impression of the fingers is left on something soft, like wax, it is often best to use printers' ink to bring out the ridges and patterns of the finger- marks. And so on for various materials. Quite a science has been built up around finger-prints.\n\n\"I wish I had that enlarging camera which I have in my laboratory.

One never has difficulty in getting up early in the country: it is so noisy, at least to a city-bred man. City noise at five A.M. is sepulchral silence compared with bucolic activity at that hour.\n\nThere were a dozen negatives which I set about developing after Craig had used up all our films. Meanwhile, he busied himself adjusting his microscope and test-tubes and getting the agar slides ready for examination.\n\nShirt-sleeves rolled up, I was deeply immersed in my work when I heard a shout in the next room, and the bathroom door flew open.\n\n\"Confound you, Kennedy, do you want to ruin these films!\" I cried.\n\nIllustration\n\n\"Confound you, Kennedy, do you want to ruin these films!\" I cried.\n\nHe shut the door with a bang. \"Hurrah, Walter!\" he exclaimed. \"I think I have it, at last.

However, we at last finished the job between us; or rather Craig finished it, with an occasional remark from me. His dexterity amazed me; it was more than mere book knowledge.\n\nFor a moment we sat regarding each other hopelessly. None of the finger-prints taken at the hall tallied with the photographed prints. Then Craig rang for the housekeeper, a faithful old soul whom even the typhoid scare could not budge from her post.\n\n\"Are you sure I have seen all the servants who were at the hall while Mr. Bisbee was here\" asked Craig.",
        "prompt": "Continue summarizing Detective story 'The Bacteriological Detective' by Unknown. This is part 3 of 4 segments. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-2):\nIn the unfolding detective story \"The Bacteriological Detective,\" Professor Kennedy and the narrator, Mr. Jameson, serve as the intellectual and observational duo at the heart of a gripping mystery rooted in bacteriology and criminal intrigue. The narrative begins with these two men discussing the intersection of science and crime, particularly the untapped potential of using biological agents—such as bacterial toxins—as instruments of criminal activity. Kennedy, a figure of scientific depth, contemplates how the evolution of criminal methods might parallel advances in science, musings that lay the groundwork for the case that challenges their combined expertise.\n\nTheir conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Eveline Bisbee, a distressed and veiled young woman who seeks Kennedy’s help with a troubling and ultimately chilling problem involving her late guardian, \"Jim\" Bisbee, a wealthy southern California oil magnate. Eveline’s account reveals a grim chronicle of typhoid fever outbreaks beginning at the Bisbee estate in New Jersey and persisting into the city, ultimately claiming the life of Jim Bisbee despite his scrupulously antiseptic lifestyle. This scenario immediately casts suspicion on the natural course of disease spread and suggests something more sinister than mere chance—a clue that the illness’s tenacity might point to deliberate human design.\n\nEveline’s aunt’s fears intensify when she learns that a new will shifts her expected inheritance of one million dollars into a trust fund benefiting the Bisbee School of Mechanical Arts, with the trustee being the lawyer James Denny. Moreover, this new will is worded so that if Eveline dies without heirs, the fortune also merges into this fund. This legal maneuver, coupled with the unnatural sequence of infections, plants the seed of doubt and suspicion in Eveline’s mind; she senses that her guardian’s untimely demise and the deadly disease stalking her family may not be accidents but possibly linked to greed and malicious intent.\n\nKennedy’s approach to Eveline’s plight is methodical and calm. He encourages her to share every detail and reveals that he already has two theories circulating in his mind—one ordinary and natural, the other “diabolical.” He promises to investigate thoroughly, beginning with a quiet trip to Bisbee Hall itself. Eveline’s silent, grateful farewell underscores not only the emotional weight of her predicament but the hope she places in these men who blend scientific rigor with detective acumen.\n\nFollowing Eveline’s departure, Kennedy and Jameson proceed immediately to Dr. Bell’s hospital, specifically to speak with the head nurse who attends to Jim Bisbee’s case. Their visit confirms through detailed charts and sincere testimony that Bisbee did indeed suffer from genuine typhoid fever, effectively ruling out poisoning by drugs or more conventional criminal methods. This finding, while reassuring in confirming the diagnosis, deepens the mysterious context: if it was truly typhoid, how did the disease manage to permeate environments so strictly protected against infection?\n\nMeanwhile, preparations begin for the investigative journey to Bisbee Hall. Kennedy, demonstrating a sense of cautious pragmatism, decides to receive inoculation against typhoid at the army post on Governor’s Island. He acknowledges that while three inoculations provide optimal immunity, a single dose offers practical protection sufficient for their brief fieldwork. Jameson expresses trepidation about the trip, but Kennedy’s resolve—and the measure of scientific precaution through vaccination—persuades him to accompany the professor.\n\nAt the army post, Kennedy’s engagement with the Major in charge reveals a broader public health context: vaccination against typhoid is standard among soldiers but remains little known among civilians. The Major notes that civilian vaccinations are rare due to general unawareness and that the Army Medical Corps welcomes such inoculations as a civic good, though they have limited means to track efficacy outside the military population. Kennedy quickly examines the existing civilian vaccination records, taking note of the names before returning the list, signaling his intent to analyze all possible leads in the tangled web of this epidemic.\n\nThis segment deepens the story’s narrative in multiple ways. Eveline’s fears extend beyond emotional distress into a tangible suspicion of foul play motivated by inheritance and greed. The legal change in Jim Bisbee’s will adds a layer of motive and opportunity, suggesting that someone close to the family—possibly even the attorney entrusted with the Bisbee estate—stands to benefit significantly if Eveline were to perish. Meanwhile, the scientific investigation gains traction as Kennedy and Jameson take concrete steps toward uncovering the truth: obtaining vaccination, visiting institutions involved, and setting out for the estate ground zero of the typhoid outbreak.\n\nThe story maintains a potent atmosphere of invisible menace—the bacteriological threat is relentless, intangible, and terrifying—heightening the psychological tension surrounding Eveline’s plight. The juxtaposition of scientific certainty (vaccinations, medical charts) with the inscrutable spread of disease in supposedly sanitized environments fuels the mystery’s central question: is this a natural outbreak, or has someone weaponized microbiology to perpetrate murder disguised as illness?\n\nThe narrative also highlights the contrasting perspectives of the protagonists. Jameson, the newspaperman, admits to fear and skepticism but gradually submits to Kennedy’s steady scientific confidence and insistence on methodical investigation. Kennedy, in turn, embodies a new kind of detective figure—one where knowledge of bacteriology replaces the traditional reliance on physical evidence or brute force, reflecting an evolution in crime detection suited to the modern age.\n\nIn summary, this second installment of \"The Bacteriological Detective\" builds substantially on the initial setup. The mysterious typhoid fever epidemic that devastated the Bisbee household is not just a medical puzzle but an entanglement of human motives, legal intrigue, and scientific investigation. Eveline Bisbee’s compelling narrative introduces an inheritance dispute shadowed by the deadly disease, prompting Kennedy and Jameson to embark on a perilous and intellectually challenging inquiry. Their visit to Dr. Bell’s hospital confirms the authenticity of the medical symptoms, while inoculation and preparation for the journey to Bisbee Hall signal their commitment to confronting the hidden, biological menace. This segment heightens the story’s tension and foreshadows an unfolding drama where bacteriology and detective work meld to confront a diabolical crime veiled behind the invisible hand of disease.\n\nCurrent segment (part 3):\nBISBEE HALL was a splendid place set in the heart of a great park whose area was measured by square miles rather than by acres. But Craig did not propose to stay there, for he arranged for accommodations in a near-by town, where we were to take our meals also. It was late when we arrived, and we spent a restless night, for the inoculation \"took.\" It wasn't any worse than a light attack of the grippe, and in the morning we were both all right again, after the passing of what is called the \"negative phase.\" I, for one, felt much safer.\n\nThe town was very much excited over the epidemic at the hall, and if I had been wondering why Craig wanted me along my wonder was soon set at rest. He had me scouring the town and country looking up every case or rumour of typhoid for miles around. I made the local weekly paper my headquarters, and the editor was very obliging. He let me read all his news letters from his local correspondent at every crossroads. I waded through accounts of new calves and colts, new fences and barns, who \"Sundayed\" with his brother, etc., and soon had a list of all the cases in that part of the country. It was not a long one, but it was scattered. After I had traced them out, following Kennedy's instructions, they showed nothing, except that they were unrelated to the epidemic at the hall.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy was very busy there. He had a microscope and slides and test-tubes and chemicals for testing things, and I don't know what all, for there was not time to initiate me into all the mysteries. He tested the water from the various driven wells and in the water-tank, and the milk from the cows;—he tried to find out what food had come in from outside, though there was practically none, for the hall was self-supporting. There was no stone he left unturned.\n\nWhen I rejoined him that night he was clearly perplexed. I don't think my report decreased his perplexity, either.\n\n\"There is only one thing left as far as I have been able to discover after one day's work,\" he said, after we had gone over our activities for the day. \"Jim Bisbee never drank the water from his own wells. He always drank a bottled water shipped down from a camp of his in New York State, where he had a remarkable mountain spring. I tested a number of the full bottles at the hall, but they were perfectly pure. There wasn't a trace of the bacillus typhosus in any of them. Then it occurred to me that, after all, that was not the thing to do. I should test the empty ones. But there weren't any empty ones. They told me they had all been taken down to the freight station yesterday to be shipped back to the camp. I hope they haven't gone yet. Let's drive around and see if they are there.\"\n\nThe freight-master was just leaving, but when he learned we were from the hall he consented to let us examine the bottles. They were corked and in wooden cases, which protected them perfectly. By the light of the station lamps and the aid of a pocket-lens, Kennedy examined them on the outside and satisfied himself that after being replaced in the wooden cases the bottles themselves had not been handled.\n\n\"Will you let me borrow some of these bottles to-night\" he asked the agent. \"I'll give you my word that they will be returned safely to-morrow. If necessary, I'll get an order for them.\"\n\nThe station-agent reluctantly yielded; especially as a small green banknote figured in the transaction. Craig and I tenderly lifted the big bottles in their cases into our trap and drove back to our rooms in the hotel. It quite excited the hangers-on to see us drive up with a lot of empty five-gallon bottles and carry them up-stairs, but I had long ago given up having any fear of public opinion in carrying out anything Craig wanted.\n\nIn our room we worked far into the night. Craig carefully swabbed out the bottom and sides of each bottle by inserting a little piece of cotton on the end of a long wire. Then he squeezed the water out of the cotton swab on small glass slides coated with agar-agar, or Japanese seaweed, a medium in which germ-cultures multiply rapidly. He put the slides away in a little oven with an alcohol-lamp which he had brought along, leaving them to remain overnight at blood heat.\n\nI had noticed all this time that he was very particular not to touch any of the bottles on the outside. As for me, I wouldn't have touched them for the world. In fact, I was getting so I hesitated to touch anything. I was almost afraid to breathe, though I knew there was no harm in that. However, it was not danger of infection in touching the bottles that made Craig so careful. He had noted, in the dim light of the station lamps, what seemed to be finger-marks on the bottles, and they had interested him, in fact, had decided him on a further investigation of the bottles.\n\n\"I am now going to bring out these very faint finger-prints on the bottles,\" remarked Craig, proceeding with his examination in the better light of our room. \"Here is some powder known to chemists as 'grey powder'—mercury and chalk. I sprinkle it over the faint markings, so, and then I brush it off with a camel's-hair brush lightly. That brings out the imprint much more clearly, as you can see. For instance, if you place your dry thumb on a piece of white paper you leave no visible impression. If grey powder is sprinkled over the spot and then brushed off a distinct impression is seen. If the impression of the fingers is left on something soft, like wax, it is often best to use printers' ink to bring out the ridges and patterns of the finger- marks. And so on for various materials. Quite a science has been built up around finger-prints.\n\n\"I wish I had that enlarging camera which I have in my laboratory. However, my ordinary camera will do, for all I want is to preserve a record of these marks, and I can enlarge the photographs later. In the morning I will photograph these marks and you can do the developing of the films. To-night we'll improvise the bathroom as a dark-room and get everything ready so that we can start in bright and early.\"\n\n\nWE were, indeed, up early. One never has difficulty in getting up early in the country: it is so noisy, at least to a city-bred man. City noise at five A.M. is sepulchral silence compared with bucolic activity at that hour.\n\nThere were a dozen negatives which I set about developing after Craig had used up all our films.

        "summary": "In the engrossing detective story \"The Bacteriological Detective,\" a fusion of scientific inquiry and investigative acumen unfolds against the backdrop of an ominous typhoid fever outbreak at Bisbee Hall. The narrative pivots around Professor Kennedy, an expert in bacteriology, and Mr. Jameson, the story's observant narrator. Their partnership synthesizes scientific rigor with practical detective work to unravel a grim mystery entwined with illness, inheritance, and possibly murder.\n\nThe saga begins with their contemplation of the evolving methods of crime, particularly the sinister possibility of weaponized bacteria. The duo’s calm intellectual discourse is interrupted by Eveline Bisbee, a veiled young woman distressed over the sudden typhoid epidemic that ravaged her late guardian, Jim Bisbee—an oil magnate with a meticulous antiseptic lifestyle. Eveline’s account reveals a prolonged and deadly typhoid outbreak both at the Bisbee estate in New Jersey and spreading into the nearby city, culminating in Jim Bisbee’s untimely death. The persistence and reach of the disease under such sanitized conditions raise suspicions of foul play rather than natural infection.\n\nEveline’s fears intensify with the revelation of a recently amended will, which radically redirects her expected inheritance—a million dollars—into a trust benefiting the Bisbee School of Mechanical Arts, with the lawyer James Denny as trustee. Crucially, the will stipulates that if Eveline dies without heirs, the entire fortune would default to this trust. This legal twist, combined with the deadly typhoid outbreak, colors the scenario with a dark undertone of greed and possible murder disguised as illness.\n\nKennedy approaches the case with measured calm, promising a rigorous two-pronged investigation: one hypothesis rooted in natural causes, the other exploring “diabolical” human intent. They verify the authenticity of Jim Bisbee’s typhoid fever diagnosis through medical charts and testimony from Dr. Bell’s hospital, dismissing conventional poisoning. However, the natural explanation falters when the disease appears relentlessly persistent in an environment presumed sterile.\n\nSeeking direct evidence, Kennedy and Jameson prepare to go to Bisbee Hall, with Kennedy receiving typhoid vaccination at an army post as a precautionary measure. This step underscores the scientific seriousness of their task, and also introduces a broader public health context regarding civilian inoculation practices.\n\nThe third segment of the story begins with their arrival at the grand Bisbee Hall, an estate set amidst expansive parkland measuring miles rather than acres. Despite the estate’s grandeur, Kenneth’s plan involves lodging and dining in a nearby town to maintain investigative neutrality. The night following their arrival proves restless due to the vaccine’s side effects, but by morning they feel sufficiently recovered and more secure.\n\nThe local town buzzes with anxiety about the typhoid epidemic at the hall. It quickly becomes apparent that Kennedy’s true purpose in bringing Jameson along is not merely companionship but to utilize Jameson’s journalistic skills to canvass the town and surrounding country, gathering every report or rumor of typhoid cases. Jameson immerses himself in the local weekly newspaper and its network of correspondents, cataloging scattered regional cases. Yet, under Kennedy’s guidance, these cases appear unrelated to the outbreak afflicting Bisbee Hall—a significant preliminary finding that confines the epicenter of the danger.\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Kennedy’s investigative approach becomes intensely scientific and meticulous. At Bisbee Hall, he assembles a mobile laboratory with a microscope, slides coated with agar-agar medium, test tubes, and various chemical reagents. He tests every conceivable vector that might harbor the typhoid bacillus: water from estate wells and tanks, milk from cows on the premises, and food supplies—even though the hall was largely self-sufficient. Despite his exhaustive scrutiny, no evidence of contamination surfaces from these sources.\n\nA pivotal lead arises with Kennedy’s discovery that Jim Bisbee never drank from the estate wells but exclusively consumed bottled water shipped from a mountain spring at one of his New York camps. Testing the full bottles reveals them pristine; free from any typhoid bacilli. This steers Kennedy toward an ingenious hypothesis—examining the empty bottles to check if contamination originated not in the water, but through contact with those who handled the emptied containers. However, the empties had recently been sent off to the freight station.\n\nKennedy and Jameson rush to the freight depot to retrieve the empty bottles, which come sealed in wooden crates. Careful not to disturb the bottles’ exteriors—although noting faint finger-marks—they transport them back to their hotel. This peculiar focus on the bottles' surfaces hints at Kennedy’s suspicion that the disease might have been transmitted via human touch rather than ingestion.\n\nThat night, Kennedy works painstakingly, swabbing the inside surfaces of the bottles with sterile cotton to trace microbial colonies by cultivating any collected bacteria on agar slides heated overnight. Simultaneously, he employs a forensic technique to reveal latent fingerprints on the bottles. Using a chemical mixture of mercury and chalk known as “grey powder,” gently brushed over the faint prints, Kennedy enhances their visibility, explaining to Jameson how such powders and ink are used to develop fingerprints on various surfaces—a nod to the intersection of traditional detective methods with modern science.\n\nThe next dawn, after hurriedly developing photographic negatives of the fingerprint evidence and preparing further bacterial cultures, they rush back to Bisbee Hall. Kennedy collects inked fingerprints from all the servants present to compare them with the prints uncovered on the empty bottles.\n\nThe laborious process of matching fingerprints—despite popular beliefs about its simplicity—proves arduous, requiring precision and patience. Yet, Kennedy’s expertise shines through in this painstaking endeavor. When the comparison is complete, however, they face a disheartening dead-end: none of the fingerprint matches correspond with any current servant on the estate.\n\nThis development forces them to reconsider who else might have had access to the bottles. Summoning the housekeeper, a steadfast and loyal old woman undeterred by the typhoid scare, Kennedy inquires about whether the list of servants they’ve fingerprinted is comprehensive. The implication is clear—there might be a hidden individual connected to the epidemic, whose fingerprints match the bottles and who thus could be implicated in the covert transmission of the disease.\n\nThe narrative in this segment underlines several pivotal advances. The investigators’ efforts at Bisbee Hall move from broad environmental testing to targeted forensic examination. They refute waterborne contamination of the drinking source but discover that the bottles’ surfaces carry human fingerprints—a forensic clue suggesting deliberate human intervention. Despite their meticulous fingerprint comparison ruling out current staff, the mystery deepens about who might have handled the bottles to infect the estate.\n\nFurthermore, the story deepens its atmosphere of invisible menace—here, not only the bacteriological threat of typhoid but also the subtler threat of a likely human conspirator hidden behind the facade of servants and caretakers. The story’s unique blend of early bacteriological science, forensic fingerprinting, and classic detective work highlights the evolving nature of crime-solving in the modern age and exposes how invisible biological agents could be manipulated for criminal ends.\n\nJameson’s initial skepticism and nervousness gradually yield to Kennedy’s methodical approach grounded in scientific certainty and calm determination. Their complementary roles—Jameson’s investigative perseverance and Kennedy’s laboratory expertise—propel the narrative toward a solution that demands new thinking in both medicine and detection.\n\nTo summarize, this third installment in \"The Bacteriological Detective\" significantly develops the story’s mystery and methodology. The typhoid outbreak at the opulent Bisbee estate remains baffling and resistant to explanation by conventional environmental vectors. Kennedy’s innovative forensic examination of the empty bottled water containers reveals fingerprint evidence not matching known staff, suggesting hidden human involvement in transmitting disease. The detectives’ combined fieldwork, scientific testing, and fingerprint analysis forge a path toward unmasking a diabolical plot lurking beneath layers of bacteriology and inheritance motives, propelling the story toward its dramatic conclusion."

She left a couple of days ago—said she was going back to New York to get another job. Glad enough I was to get rid of her, too, for she was drunk most of the time after the typhoid appeared.\"\n\n\"Well, Walter, I guess we shall have to go back to New York again, then,\" exclaimed Kennedy. \"Oh, I beg pardon, Mrs. Rawson, for interrupting. Thank you ever so much. Where did Bridget come from?\"\n\n\"She came well recommended, sir. Here is the letter in my writing-desk. She had been employed by the Caswell-Joneses at Shelter Island before she came here.\"\n\n\"I may keep this letter\" asked Craig, scanning it quickly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"By the way, where were the bottles of spring water kept\"\n\n\"In the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Did Bridget take charge of them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Bisbee have any guests during the last week that he was here?\"\n\n\"Only Mr. Denny one night.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" exclaimed Craig. \"Well, it will not be so hard for us to unravel this matter, after all, when we get back to the city. We must make that noon train, Walter. There is nothing more for us to do here.\"\n\nEmerging from the \"Tube\" at Ninth Street, Craig hustled me into a taxicab, and in almost no time we were at police headquarters.\n\n\nFORTUNATELY, Inspector Barney O'Connor was in and in an amiable mood, too, for Kennedy had been careful that the Central Office received a large share of credit for the Kerr Parker case. Craig sketched hastily the details of this new case. O'Connor's face was a study. His honest blue Irish eyes fairly bulged in wonder, and when Craig concluded with a request for help I think O'Connor would have given him anything in the office, just to figure in the case.\n\n\"First, I want one of your men to go to the surrogate's office and get the original of the will. I shall return it within a couple of hours—all I want to do is to make a photographic copy.

And send another fellow up to the employment offices on Fourth Avenue and have him locate this cook, Bridget Fallon. I want her finger-prints, too. Perhaps she had better be detained, for I don't want her to get away. Oh, and say, O'Connor, do you want to finish this case up like the crack of a whip to- night?\"\n\n\"I'm game, sir. What of it?\"\n\n\"Let me see. It is now four o'clock. If you can get hold of all these people in time I think I shall be ready for the final scene to-night—say, at nine. You know how to arrange it. Have them all present at my laboratory at nine, and I promise we shall have a story that will get into the morning papers with leaded type on the front page.\"\n\n\"Now, Walter,\" he added, as we hurried down to the taxicab again, \"I want you to drop off at the Department of Health with this card to the commissioner. I believe you know Dr. Leslie. Well, ask him if he knows anything about this Bridget Fallon. I will go on up-town to the laboratory and get my apparatus ready. You needn't come up till nine, old fellow, for I shall be busy till then, but be sure when you come that you bring the record of this Fallon woman if you have to beg, borrow, or steal it.\"\n\nI didn't understand it, but I took the card and obeyed implicitly. It is needless to say that I was keyed up to the greatest pitch of excitement during my interview with the health commissioner, when I finally got in to see him. I hadn't talked to him long before a great light struck me, and I began to see what Craig was driving at. The commissioner saw it first.\n\n\"If you don't mind, Mr. Jameson.\" he said, after I had told him as much of my story as I could, \"will you call up Professor Kennedy and tell him I'd like very much to be present to-night myself?\"\n\n\"Certainly I will,\" I replied, glad to get my errand done in first-class fashion in that way.\n\n\nTHINGS must have been running smoothly, for while I was sitting in our apartment after dinner, impatiently waiting for half-past eight, when the commissioner had promised to call for me and go up to the laboratory, the telephone rang. It was Craig.\n\n\"Walter, might I ask a favour of you?\" he said. \"When the commissioner comes ask him to stop at the Louis Quinze and bring Miss Bisbee up, too. Tell her it is important.

Using a chemical mixture of mercury and chalk known as “grey powder,” gently brushed over the faint prints, Kennedy enhances their visibility, explaining to Jameson how such powders and ink are used to develop fingerprints on various surfaces—a nod to the intersection of traditional detective methods with modern science.\n\nThe next dawn, after hurriedly developing photographic negatives of the fingerprint evidence and preparing further bacterial cultures, they rush back to Bisbee Hall. Kennedy collects inked fingerprints from all the servants present to compare them with the prints uncovered on the empty bottles.\n\nThe laborious process of matching fingerprints—despite popular beliefs about its simplicity—proves arduous, requiring precision and patience. Yet, Kennedy’s expertise shines through in this painstaking endeavor. When the comparison is complete, however, they face a disheartening dead-end: none of the fingerprint matches correspond with any current servant on the estate.\n\nThis development forces them to reconsider who else might have had access to the bottles. Summoning the housekeeper, a steadfast and loyal old woman undeterred by the typhoid scare, Kennedy inquires about whether the list of servants they’ve fingerprinted is comprehensive. The implication is clear—there might be a hidden individual connected to the epidemic, whose fingerprints match the bottles and who thus could be implicated in the covert transmission of the disease.\n\nThe narrative in this segment underlines several pivotal advances. The investigators’ efforts at Bisbee Hall move from broad environmental testing to targeted forensic examination. They refute waterborne contamination of the drinking source but discover that the bottles’ surfaces carry human fingerprints—a forensic clue suggesting deliberate human intervention. Despite their meticulous fingerprint comparison ruling out current staff, the mystery deepens about who might have handled the bottles to infect the estate.\n\nFurthermore, the story deepens its atmosphere of invisible menace—here, not only the bacteriological threat of typhoid but also the subtler threat of a likely human conspirator hidden behind the facade of servants and caretakers. The story’s unique blend of early bacteriological science, forensic fingerprinting, and classic detective work highlights the evolving nature of crime-solving in the modern age and exposes how invisible biological agents could be manipulated for criminal ends.\n\nJameson’s initial skepticism and nervousness gradually yield to Kennedy’s methodical approach grounded in scientific certainty and calm determination. Their complementary roles—Jameson’s investigative perseverance and Kennedy’s laboratory expertise—propel the narrative toward a solution that demands new thinking in both medicine and detection.\n\nTo summarize, this third installment in \"The Bacteriological Detective\" significantly develops the story’s mystery and methodology. The typhoid outbreak at the opulent Bisbee estate remains baffling and resistant to explanation by conventional environmental vectors. Kennedy’s innovative forensic examination of the empty bottled water containers reveals fingerprint evidence not matching known staff, suggesting hidden human involvement in transmitting disease. The detectives’ combined fieldwork, scientific testing, and fingerprint analysis forge a path toward unmasking a diabolical plot lurking beneath layers of bacteriology and inheritance motives, propelling the story toward its dramatic conclusion.\n\nCurrent segment (part 4):\n\"Why, no, sir—you didn't ask that. You asked to see all who are here now. There is only one who has left, the cook, Bridget Fallon. She left a couple of days ago—said she was going back to New York to get another job. Glad enough I was to get rid of her, too, for she was drunk most of the time after the typhoid appeared.\"\n\n\"Well, Walter, I guess we shall have to go back to New York again, then,\" exclaimed Kennedy. \"Oh, I beg pardon, Mrs. Rawson, for interrupting. Thank you ever so much. Where did Bridget come from?\"\n\n\"She came well recommended, sir. Here is the letter in my writing-desk. She had been employed by the Caswell-Joneses at Shelter Island before she came here.\"\n\n\"I may keep this letter\" asked Craig, scanning it quickly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"By the way, where were the bottles of spring water kept\"\n\n\"In the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Did Bridget take charge of them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did Mr. Bisbee have any guests during the last week that he was here?\"\n\n\"Only Mr. Denny one night.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" exclaimed Craig. \"Well, it will not be so hard for us to unravel this matter, after all, when we get back to the city. We must make that noon train, Walter. There is nothing more for us to do here.\"\n\nEmerging from the \"Tube\" at Ninth Street, Craig hustled me into a taxicab, and in almost no time we were at police headquarters.\n\n\nFORTUNATELY, Inspector Barney O'Connor was in and in an amiable mood, too, for Kennedy had been careful that the Central Office received a large share of credit for the Kerr Parker case. Craig sketched hastily the details of this new case. O'Connor's face was a study. His honest blue Irish eyes fairly bulged in wonder, and when Craig concluded with a request for help I think O'Connor would have given him anything in the office, just to figure in the case.\n\n\"First, I want one of your men to go to the surrogate's office and get the original of the will. I shall return it within a couple of hours—all I want to do is to make a photographic copy. Then another man must find this lawyer, James Denny, and in some way get his finger-prints—you must arrange that yourself. And send another fellow up to the employment offices on Fourth Avenue and have him locate this cook, Bridget Fallon. I want her finger-prints, too. Perhaps she had better be detained, for I don't want her to get away. Oh, and say, O'Connor, do you want to finish this case up like the crack of a whip to- night?\"\n\n\"I'm game, sir. What of it?\"\n\n\"Let me see. It is now four o'clock. If you can get hold of all these people in time I think I shall be ready for the final scene to-night—say, at nine. You know how to arrange it. Have them all present at my laboratory at nine, and I promise we shall have a story that will get into the morning papers with leaded type on the front page.\"\n\n\"Now, Walter,\" he added, as we hurried down to the taxicab again, \"I want you to drop off at the Department of Health with this card to the commissioner. I believe you know Dr. Leslie. Well, ask him if he knows anything about this Bridget Fallon. I will go on up-town to the laboratory and get my apparatus ready. You needn't come up till nine, old fellow, for I shall be busy till then, but be sure when you come that you bring the record of this Fallon woman if you have to beg, borrow, or steal it.\"\n\nI didn't understand it, but I took the card and obeyed implicitly. It is needless to say that I was keyed up to the greatest pitch of excitement during my interview with the health commissioner, when I finally got in to see him. I hadn't talked to him long before a great light struck me, and I began to see what Craig was driving at. The commissioner saw it first.\n\n\"If you don't mind, Mr. Jameson.\" he said, after I had told him as much of my story as I could, \"will you call up Professor Kennedy and tell him I'd like very much to be present to-night myself?\"\n\n\"Certainly I will,\" I replied, glad to get my errand done in first-class fashion in that way.\n\n\nTHINGS must have been running smoothly, for while I was sitting in our apartment after dinner, impatiently waiting for half-past eight, when the commissioner had promised to call for me and go up to the laboratory, the telephone rang. It was Craig.\n\n\"Walter, might I ask a favour of you?\" he said. \"When the commissioner comes ask him to stop at the Louis Quinze and bring Miss Bisbee up, too. Tell her it is important. No more now. Things are going ahead fine.\"\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

        "summary": "In \"The Bacteriological Detective,\" a captivating detective narrative blending bacteriological science with traditional sleuthing, Professor Kennedy and narrator Jameson investigate a mysterious typhoid fever outbreak at the Bisbee estate, centered on the recent death of oil magnate Jim Bisbee and the suspicious amendment of his will. The story, set against the backdrop of early scientific advancements and forensic techniques, explores the sinister possibility of weaponized bacteria employed to advance a convoluted inheritance scheme.\n\nThe investigation begins when Eveline Bisbee, Jim’s young ward and expected heiress, approaches Kennedy and Jameson with fears that the persistent typhoid outbreak at Bisbee Hall was no mere accident but a deliberate act. The outbreak, initially puzzling due to the estate’s otherwise antiseptic and self-contained environment—including heavy reliance on bottled mountain spring water rather than local sources—appeared targeted and unrelenting. Further complicating the situation was the new will, which redirected Jim’s fortune from Eveline to a new trust for a mechanical arts school, with lawyer James Denny as trustee. The will’s clause stipulated that if Eveline died heirless, the full estate would ultimately pass to this trust, raising motives for malfeasance.\n\nKennedy, a bacteriologist versed in modern science and investigative rigor, connects natural disease theories with the possibility of human conspiracy. After confirming the official diagnosis and examining Jim Bisbee’s medical records, they traverse to the estate and nearby town to gather intelligence and samples. Jameson canvasses local newspapers and contacts, determining that typhoid cases elsewhere in the region do not relate to the estate’s outbreak, making Bisbee Hall the unique epicenter.\n\nAt the estate, Kennedy meticulously sets up a mobile laboratory to test every conceivable source of infection—estate water, milk, and food supplies—all returning negative for typhoid bacilli. Crucially, the estate relied on bottled mountain spring water transported from New York camps, and these sealed full bottles tested entirely clean. This shifts Kennedy’s attention to the emptied bottles, previously sent to the freight depot. A breakthrough comes when Kennedy swabs the inside surfaces of the used bottles, cultivating bacterial colonies, and simultaneously searches for latent fingerprints on the bottle surfaces using a mercury and chalk powder technique. The forensic fingerprinting reveals prints on the bottles’ exteriors, but comparison with the fingerprints of all current estate servants shows no match, suggesting a hidden or departed individual’s involvement.\n\nIn this final segment, the story deepens its suspense as these unanswered questions prompt an urgent return to New York. Interviewing Mrs. Rawson, the housekeeper, Kennedy and Jameson learn that only one domestic, a cook named Bridget Fallon, had recently left the estate. Bridget is described as unreliable and frequently intoxicated after the typhoid outbreak began. Her prior employment was with the Caswell-Jones family at Shelter Island, validated by a letter of recommendation that Kennedy secures for further investigation. Meanwhile, Bridget had control over the storage of the spring water bottles in the estate kitchen, and during the outbreak only one guest, the lawyer James Denny, visited the estate briefly.\n\nKennedy’s realization—that Bridget Fallon’s recent departure and direct contact with the implicated bottles could be pivotal—ushers the investigation into its critical phase. The team hurries back to New York, reaching the police headquarters where Inspector Barney O'Connor eagerly commits his resources and cooperation. Kennedy anticipates a dramatic resolution and enlists O'Connor’s men to retrieve the original will from the surrogate’s office, locate and fingerprint James Denny and Bridget Fallon, and hold Bridget if necessary to prevent her disappearance.\n\nFurther networking takes place at the Department of Health, where Jameson seeks information on Bridget from the commissioner, Dr. Leslie. The commissioner becomes so intrigued by the case that he requests to attend the impending final confrontation, signaling the investigation’s seriousness and intertwining public health authority with criminal justice. Kennedy arranges a gathering at the police laboratory later that evening involving all principal figures, including Miss Bisbee, the health commissioner, and law enforcement officials.\n\nThe story’s suspense intensifies as the prepared scientific and forensic evidences converge toward unveiling the hidden conspirator exploiting their bacteriological knowledge to try to murder Eveline and seize the fortune through a scheme disguised as disease. Kennedy’s blend of bacteriology, fingerprint analysis, and classic detective work stands at the forefront, demonstrating the evolution of detective methodology in the face of modern microbial threat.\n\nOverall, \"The Bacteriological Detective\" unfolds as a pioneering crime narrative where invisible microbial agents become tools of murder, inheritance intrigue complicates motives, and scientific method complements detective intuition. The final developments centered around Bridget Fallon, her suspicious behaviors, and her fingerprints potentially matching those on the tainted bottles promise a dramatic denouement. Professor Kennedy’s calm, scientific approach and Jameson’s journalistic perseverance, supported by efficient police cooperation and public health insights, forge a multi-disciplinary investigative model. The story highlights the possibilities and challenges that scientific advancements introduce into crime detection, emphasizing both the dangers of bioterrorism and the power of modern forensic science to bring criminals to justice."
