    "full_text": "“The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker” unfolds as a psychologically layered detective story examining the brutal murder of Mrs. Paul Vincent, intertwining themes of financial desperation, hidden passions, and cryptic symbolism. The narrative begins with the discovery of Mrs. Vincent’s corpse in the study of Ulster Lodge, a Brixton residence, evidencing a violent struggle and apparent robbery, notably the theft of two hundred pounds. Mr. Vincent, a stockbroker frequently away on business, had left his wife home alone that fateful evening, creating opportunity and suspicion alike.\n\nThe investigation, led by a thoughtful and pragmatic inspector, emphasizes the steady accumulation of factual evidence over romanticized genius. Initial clues include a broken fencing foil and a missing hatchet—objects that imply a close-quarters confrontation rather than random intrusion. The peculiar discovery of an enigmatic green-stone idol of presumed New Zealand origin beneath the fireplace becomes a central symbol with potential to unlock hidden motives.\n\nKey to the unfolding mystery is Julian Roy, a medical student and acquaintance of Mr. Vincent, who had been in financial entanglements with the stockbroker and associated with Clara Ford, a woman whose brother was caught in embezzlement troubles. The stolen money traces a complicated web of debts and desperation, setting the stage for a financial motive behind the crime. The detective carefully maneuvers to trap the suspect, informing banks about the stolen notes and withholding information to avoid alerting the perpetrator prematurely, culminating in Roy’s arrest at his lodgings.\n\nRoy’s defense is complex and emotionally charged: he claims he was at Ulster Lodge on Vincent’s instructions to collect a loan to assist Clara Ford’s brother, arguing that Vincent had authorized the release of money by Mrs. Vincent. He insists that upon leaving, Mrs. Vincent was unharmed and content. However, Mr. Vincent vehemently denies providing any such authorization, casting suspicion on Roy’s version of events. The detective, recognizing the intricacies of evidence and testimony, refrains from premature conclusion, though the public prematurely hails Roy’s arrest as a solution.\n\nEnter Clara Ford, who passionately advocates for Roy’s innocence, revealing her engagement to him and denouncing Mr. Vincent as a duplicitous figure. She describes Vincent not as a devoted husband but as a man with dishonorable intentions toward her—having made improper proposals and attempted to disrupt her relationship with Roy. Clara’s revelations point to a darker portrait of Vincent; driven possibly by passion and deceit, he presents as a man who both coveted Clara and bore resentment toward Roy. She proposes to prove Vincent’s true character by orchestrating a confrontation, inviting the detective to witness Vincent’s duplicity firsthand in her brother’s rooms.\n\nThis segment significantly enriches the narrative, shifting suspicion and complicating motives. Clara’s courage and sharpness contrast with the detective’s methodical approach, introducing the potent element of personal betrayal and hidden emotional currents within the circle around Vincent and Roy. She expresses firm belief in Roy’s innocence despite overwhelming appearances, appealing to the detective’s sense of justice and leaving the green-stone idol in her possession—an object she believes capable of revealing the truth.\n\nFollowing the inquest that returns a verdict of wilful murder by unknown persons, and with Roy committed for trial but reserving his defense, Clara prepares her strategic encounter. The detective visits her as arranged and is soon hidden behind a curtain during a pivotal meeting with Vincent. The ensuing scene is tense and revealing. Vincent, under Clara’s steady interrogation, confesses his love for her despite his marriage, calling his wife “gone” and disparaging his former affection for her. His declarations reveal his desire to marry Clara and his suspicion and condemnation of Roy as the murderer.\n\nClara confronts Vincent with the green-stone idol, asking pointedly if he believes Roy was the person who left it behind while committing the murder. Vincent feigns ignorance, though the detective notes Vincent’s defiant acknowledgment of meeting a captain of a New Zealand steamer at the Alhambra—a connection that ties back to the idol’s origins and suggests premeditation or at least deeper knowledge than he admits.\n\nThis confrontation crystallizes the story’s core tensions: the intersection of hidden passion, jealousy, and financial desperation, played out with the enigmatic green-stone idol as both literal and symbolic evidence. Vincent emerges not as the wronged husband but as a man driven by self-interest and passion, perhaps implicating him more deeply in the murder. Clara’s boldness and clever deductions strain against the limitations of formal detective procedure, providing a humanizing and dramatic counterpoint to the official inquiry.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the detective maintains a balanced, skeptical stance, wary of quick judgments and aware of the flaws in human testimony. The story critiques easy solutions, suggesting that evidence can mislead and that truths often lie beneath emotionally charged facades. The idol’s foreign provenance and mysterious presence in the scene of the crime tie the local tragedy to unexpected cultural and interpersonal complexities.\n\nIn summary, “The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker” is a richly textured detective tale that blends meticulous police work with psychological and social insight. The story probes the fragile boundaries between friendship, love, jealousy, and betrayal, set against a backdrop of financial woes and enigmatic artifacts. The evolving narrative—from Roy’s arrest and defense, Mr. Vincent’s denials and hidden passions, Clara Ford’s courageous advocacy, to the symbolic weight of the green-stone idol—challenges readers to look beyond surface appearances.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. MOTIVE\n   •  Julian Roy – Needed £200 to save Clara Ford’s brother, but he could have obtained it legitimately with a promissory note or by renewed borrowing.  No gain in murdering Mrs Vincent; in fact, killing her would immediately stop the loan and ensure a police hunt.  No emotional motive.\n   •  Paul Vincent – Two converging motives:\n        a) Passion: he is in love with Clara Ford and wants his wife “out of the way”.\n        b) Self-interest: if Mrs Vincent dies during a supposed burglary, he keeps all his property and can marry Clara – while an easy-to-frame scapegoat (Roy) removes suspicion from himself.\n   •  An unknown burglar – would steal jewellery or portable valuables as well, not merely £200 in notes.  No known link with the green-stone idol.\n\n2. OPPORTUNITY\n   •  House showed no forcible entry; the murderer was either admitted or held a key.  That fits the husband, not an outsider, and certainly not Roy who was seen to depart peacefully.\n   •  Vincent’s “business trip” is self-certified; nothing proves he could not slip back to Brixton, commit the murder, and return to town.\n   •  Roy’s known visit ended with Mrs Vincent alive and “quite cheerful” according to two servants who heard them talking but no quarrel.  The timing leaves a gap between Roy’s departure and the moment the body is discovered—ample time for Vincent.\n   \n3. PHYSICAL / CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE\n   •  Broken fencing-foil – Mrs Vincent grabbed the first thing at hand, suggesting she recognised the attacker (one does not fence with a stranger holding an axe).\n   •  Missing hatchet – an indoor tool; again points to someone familiar with the house.\n   •  Green-stone (Maori) idol – clue clinches it.  No one but Vincent is connected with New Zealand, and he admits meeting “a captain of a New Zealand steamer at the Alhambra.”  So the idol was Vincent’s, inadvertently or purposely dropped.  \n   •  Stolen notes – Roy is found with them because Mrs Vincent handed them over voluntarily (as Roy says).  The thief/murderer therefore did NOT take the money; the “robbery” is staged.\n   •  Vincent’s conduct – speaks of his wife in the past tense (“She is gone”) even before the coroner’s verdict; tries to blacken Roy; is eager to marry Clara at once.  Classic behaviour of a guilty spouse framing a rival.\n\n4. LOGICAL DEDUCTION\n   a) If Roy were the killer, he would not leave the idol belonging to Vincent; he would pocket it or throw it away.\n   b) If an unknown burglar were the killer, he would not know where the household hatchet was kept, nor restrict himself to £200.\n   c) The only person who benefits by both Mrs Vincent’s death and Roy’s arrest is Paul Vincent.\n   Therefore Paul Vincent is the murderer, acting alone.  No evidence shows that Clara, the captain, or anyone else helped him.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPaul Vincent, Julian Roy, Clara Ford, Ford’s unnamed brother, An unknown burglar\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nPaul Vincent\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. While ostensibly away on business, Paul Vincent slips back to Ulster Lodge with his own key.\n2. Earlier, wanting both to placate Roy (and keep him close at hand as a future scapegoat) and to set up an alibi, Vincent told Roy that Mrs Vincent would give him £200 that very night.\n3. Roy arrives, receives the notes from Mrs Vincent, thanks her, and leaves at about 9 p.m.\n4. Shortly afterwards Vincent enters the study.  His wife is surprised but not alarmed; when he declares he is leaving her for Clara she resists him.  She snatches a fencing-foil from the wall; he seizes the small hatchet from the bookcase.  In the struggle the foil snaps; Vincent strikes repeatedly, killing her.\n5. To divert suspicion he up-ends drawers, removes the hatchet, and drops (or places) the Maori green-stone idol near the fireplace, turning the scene into a bizarre “burglar’s job” by some exotic intruder.\n6. He slips away, rejoins his “business” route, and telegraphs the police next morning as the bereaved, outraged husband.\n7. Because the £200 is missing from the safe and the notes are later found in Roy’s possession, the police seize on the apparent motive and arrest Roy.\n8. Clara Ford, convinced of Roy’s innocence, lures Vincent into a private interview.  Under her skilful probing, Vincent admits both his passion for her and his deeper knowledge of the idol—confirming the detective’s suspicions.  He is subsequently charged and convicted of his wife’s murder.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Julian Roy – Entered the house openly, received the money openly, left Mrs Vincent alive, and had no practical or emotional gain from killing her.  The only incriminating fact (possession of the notes) is fully explained by Mrs Vincent’s voluntary hand-over, and no physical evidence links him to the violent struggle.\n•  Clara Ford – Nowhere near Ulster Lodge that night; her only involvement is exposing Vincent.  No motive to kill a woman who stood between her and Roy’s benefactor.\n•  Ford’s brother – Never leaves his lodgings; his entire concern is the embezzlement case against himself.\n•  Unknown burglar – No signs of forced entry, minimal loot, and presence of a household hatchet all contradict professional burglary.  Pure red herring planted by Vincent.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I am not talking of the novelist’s miracle-monger, but of the flesh and blood reality who is liable to err, and who frequently proves such liability. You can take it as certain that a detective who sets down a clean run and no hitch as entirely due to his astucity, is young in years, and still younger in experience. Older men, who have been bamboozled a hundred times by the craft of criminality, recognize the influence of Chance to make or mar. There you have it! Nine times out of ten, Chance does more in clinching a case than all the dexterity and mother-wit of the man in charge. The exception must be engineered by an infallible apostle. Such a one is unknown to me — out of print.\nThis opinion, based rather on collective experience than on any one episode, can be substantiated by several incontrovertible facts. In this instance, one will suffice. Therefore, I take the Brixton case to illustrate Chance as a factor in human affairs. Had it not been for that Maori fetish — but such rather ends than begins the story. Therefore it were wise to dismiss it for the moment. Yet that piece of green-stone hanged — a person mentioned hereafter.\nWhen Mr and Mrs Paul Vincent set up housekeeping at Ulster Lodge they were regarded as decided acquisitions to Brixton society. She, pretty and musical; he, smart in looks, moderately well off, and an excellent tennis-player. Their progenitors, his father and her mother (both since deceased), had lived a life of undoubted middle-class respectability. The halo thereof still environed their children, who were, in consequence of such inherited grace and their own individualisms, much sought after by genteel Brixtonians. Moreover, this popular couple were devoted to each other, and even after three years of marriage they posed still as lovers. This was as it should be, and by admiring friends and relations the Vincents were regarded as paragons of matrimonial perfection. Vincent was a stockbroker; therefore he passed most of his time in the City.\nJudge, then, of the commotion, when pretty Mrs Vincent was discovered in the study, stabbed to the heart. So aimless a crime were scarce imaginable. She had many friends, no known enemies, yet she came to this tragic end. Closer examination revealed that the escritoire had been broken into, and Mr Vincent declared himself the poorer by two hundred pounds. Primarily, therefore, robbery was the sole object, but, by reason of Mrs Vincent’s interference, the thief had been converted into a murderer.\nSo excellently had the assassin chosen his time, that such choice argued a close acquaintance with the domestic economy of Ulster Lodge. The husband was detained in town till midnight; the servants (cook and housemaid), on leave to attend wedding festivities, were absent till eleven o’clock. Mrs Vincent, therefore, was absolutely alone in the house for six hours, during which period the crime had been committed. The servants discovered the body of their unfortunate mistress and raised the alarm at once. Later on Vincent arrived to find his wife dead, his house in possession of the police, and the two servants in hysterics. For that night nothing could be done, but at dawn a move was made towards elucidating the mystery. At this point I come into the story.\nInstructed at nine o’clock to take charge of the case, by ten I was on the spot noting details and collecting evidence. Beyond removal of the body nothing had been disturbed, and the study was in precisely the same condition as when the crime was discovered. I examined carefully the apartment, and afterwards interrogated the cook, the housemaid, and, lastly, the master of the house. The result gave me slight hope of securing the assassin.\nThe room (a fair-sized one, looking out on to a lawn between house and road) was furnished in cheap bachelor fashion; an old-fashioned desk placed at right angles to the window, a round table reaching nigh the sill, two arm-chairs, three of the ordinary cane-seated kind, and on the mantelpiece an arrangement of pipes, pistols, boxing-gloves, and foils. One of these latter was missing.\nA single glimpse showed how terrible a struggle had taken place before the murderer had overpowered his victim. The tablecloth lay disorderly on the floor, two of the lighter chairs were overturned, and the desk, with several drawers open, was hacked about considerably. No key was in the door-lock which faced the escritoire, and the window-snick was fastened securely.\nFurther search resulted in the following discoveries:\n1.  A hatchet used for chopping wood (found near the desk).\n2.  A foil with the button broken off (lying under the table).\n3.  A green-stone idol (edged under the fender).\nThe cook (defiantly courageous by reason of brandy) declared that she had left the house at four o’clock on the previous day and had returned close on eleven. The back door (to her surprise) was open. With the housemaid she went to inform her mistress of this fact, and found the body lying midway between door and fireplace. At once she called in the police. Her master and mistress were a most attached couple, and (so far as she knew) they had no enemies.\nSimilar evidence was obtained from the housemaid with the additional information that the hatchet belonged to the woodshed. The other rooms were undisturbed.\nPoor young Vincent was so broken down by the tragedy that he could hardly answer my questions with calmness. Sympathizing with his natural grief, I interrogated him as delicately as was possible, and I am bound to admit that he replied with remarkable promptitude and clearness.\n“What do you know of this unhappy affair?” I asked when we were alone in the drawing-room. He refused to stay in the study, as was surely natural under the circumstances.\n“Absolutely nothing,” he replied. “I went to the City yesterday at ten in the morning, and, as I had business to do, I wired my wife I would not return till midnight. She was full of health and spirits when I last saw her, but now —” Incapable of further speech he made a gesture of despair. Then, after a pause, he added, “Have you any theory on the subject?”\n“Judging from the wrecked condition of the desk I should say robbery —”\n“Robbery?” he interrupted, changing colour. “Yes, that was the motive. I had two hundred pounds locked up in the desk.”\n“In gold or notes?”\n“The latter. Four fifties. Bank of England.”\n“You are sure they are missing?”\n“Yes. The drawer in which they were placed is smashed to pieces.”\n“Did any one know you had placed two hundred pounds therein?”\n“No! Save my wife, and yet — ah!” he said, breaking off abruptly, “that is impossible.”\n“What is impossible?”\n“I will tell you when I hear your theory.”\n“You got that notion out of novels of the shilling sort,” I answered dryly. “Every detective doesn’t theorize on the instant. I haven’t any particular theory that I know of. Whosoever committed this crime must have known your wife was alone in the house and that there was two hundred pounds locked up in that desk. Did you mention these two facts to any one?”\nVincent pulled his moustache in some embarrassment. I guessed by the action that he had been indiscreet.\n“I don’t wish to get an innocent person into trouble,” he said at length, “but I did mention it — to a man called Roy.”\n“For what reason?”\n“It is a bit of a story. I lost two hundred to a friend at cards and drew four fifties to pay him. He went out of town, so I locked up the money in my desk for safety. Last night Roy came to me at the club, much agitated, and asked me to loan him a hundred. Said it meant ruin else. I offered him a cheque, but he wanted cash. I then told him I had left two hundred at home, so at the moment, could not lay my hand on it. He asked if he could not go to Brixton for it, but I said the house was empty, and —”\n“But it wasn’t empty,” I interrupted.\n“I believed it would be! I knew the servants were going to that wedding, and I thought my wife, instead of spending a lonely evening, would call on some friend.”\n“Well, and after you told Roy that the house was empty?”\n“He went away, looking awfully cut up, and swore he must have the money at any price. But it is quite impossible he could have anything to do with this.”\n“I don’t know. You told him where the money was and that the house was unprotected, as you thought. What was more probable than that he should have come down with the intention of stealing the money? If so, what follows? Entering by the back door, he takes the hatchet from the wood-shed to open the desk. Your wife, hearing a noise, discovers him in the study. In a state of frenzy, he snatches a foil from the mantelpiece and kills her, then decamps with the money. There is your theory, and a mighty bad one — for Roy.”\n“You don’t intend to arrest him?” asked Vincent quickly.\n“Not on insufficient evidence! If he committed the crime and stole the money it is certain that, sooner or later, he will change the notes. Now, if I had the numbers —”\n“Here are the numbers,” said Vincent, producing his pocket-book. “I always take the numbers of such large notes. But surely,” he added as I copied them down — “surely you don’t think Roy guilty?”",

He refused to stay in the study, as was surely natural under the circumstances.\n“Absolutely nothing,” he replied. “I went to the City yesterday at ten in the morning, and, as I had business to do, I wired my wife I would not return till midnight. She was full of health and spirits when I last saw her, but now —” Incapable of further speech he made a gesture of despair. Then, after a pause, he added, “Have you any theory on the subject?”\n“Judging from the wrecked condition of the desk I should say robbery —”\n“Robbery?” he interrupted, changing colour. “Yes, that was the motive. I had two hundred pounds locked up in the desk.”\n“In gold or notes?”\n“The latter. Four fifties. Bank of England.”\n“You are sure they are missing?”\n“Yes. The drawer in which they were placed is smashed to pieces.”\n“Did any one know you had placed two hundred pounds therein?”\n“No! Save my wife, and yet — ah!” he said, breaking off abruptly, “that is impossible.”\n“What is impossible?”\n“I will tell you when I hear your theory.”\n“You got that notion out of novels of the shilling sort,” I answered dryly. “Every detective doesn’t theorize on the instant. I haven’t any particular theory that I know of. Whosoever committed this crime must have known your wife was alone in the house and that there was two hundred pounds locked up in that desk. Did you mention these two facts to any one?”\nVincent pulled his moustache in some embarrassment. I guessed by the action that he had been indiscreet.\n“I don’t wish to get an innocent person into trouble,” he said at length, “but I did mention it — to a man called Roy.”\n“For what reason?”\n“It is a bit of a story. I lost two hundred to a friend at cards and drew four fifties to pay him. He went out of town, so I locked up the money in my desk for safety. Last night Roy came to me at the club, much agitated, and asked me to loan him a hundred. Said it meant ruin else. I offered him a cheque, but he wanted cash. I then told him I had left two hundred at home, so at the moment, could not lay my hand on it. He asked if he could not go to Brixton for it, but I said the house was empty, and —”\n“But it wasn’t empty,” I interrupted.\n“I believed it would be! I knew the servants were going to that wedding, and I thought my wife, instead of spending a lonely evening, would call on some friend.”\n“Well, and after you told Roy that the house was empty?”\n“He went away, looking awfully cut up, and swore he must have the money at any price. But it is quite impossible he could have anything to do with this.”\n“I don’t know. You told him where the money was and that the house was unprotected, as you thought. What was more probable than that he should have come down with the intention of stealing the money? If so, what follows? Entering by the back door, he takes the hatchet from the wood-shed to open the desk. Your wife, hearing a noise, discovers him in the study. In a state of frenzy, he snatches a foil from the mantelpiece and kills her, then decamps with the money. There is your theory, and a mighty bad one — for Roy.”\n“You don’t intend to arrest him?” asked Vincent quickly.\n“Not on insufficient evidence! If he committed the crime and stole the money it is certain that, sooner or later, he will change the notes. Now, if I had the numbers —”\n“Here are the numbers,” said Vincent, producing his pocket-book. “I always take the numbers of such large notes. But surely,” he added as I copied them down — “surely you don’t think Roy guilty?”\n\nProvide a comprehensive summary (between 600 and 900 words long) of the key events, information, and important details from this segment.",
        "summary": "The opening segment of the detective story \"The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker\" sets both the tone and philosophical outlook of the narrator, presumably the detective, on the nature of detective work and the role of chance in solving crimes. He cautions against the romanticized view of detectives as infallible masterminds, arguing instead that real detectives often owe as much to luck and happenstance as to skill and intuition. This worldview is introduced through a reflective preamble before segueing into the central case that will frame the story: the murder of Mrs. Paul Vincent.\n\nThe narrative begins by introducing Mr. and Mrs. Paul Vincent, a well-regarded, middle-class couple who have recently established their home, Ulster Lodge, in the respectable Brixton district. Both held in high esteem by their social circle, Vincent is described as an attractive, moderately wealthy stockbroker and an avid tennis player, while his wife is noted for her beauty and musical talents. The couple’s reputations are bolstered by the respectability of their deceased parents and their affectionate relationship, which continues to impress friends and family after three years of marriage. Their life appears to be a model of domestic harmony, making the subsequent tragedy all the more shocking.\n\nThe tranquility of their domestic scene is shattered when Mrs. Vincent is found murdered in their study, stabbed through the heart. The crime is immediately puzzling due to the absence of any obvious motive or enemy. Upon investigation, it becomes clear that the crime was the result of a botched robbery: the desk in the study, described as an ordinary piece of furniture in a modestly furnished room, had been violently ransacked, and two hundred pounds in banknotes, securely locked inside a drawer, were missing. The narrative draws attention to the brutal struggle that had occurred in the room—the overturned furniture, the hacked desk drawers, and the disorderly tablecloth testify to a desperate fight before the fatal stabbing.\n\nSignificantly, the murderer had intimate knowledge of the household’s rhythms. Mr. Vincent was in the City until midnight, and the only servants, the cook and housemaid, were attending a wedding and absent from about four o’clock until nearly eleven. Mrs. Vincent was left completely alone from five in the evening till her body was discovered, marking a six-hour window in which the murder took place. The servants found her body close to the back door, which they noted was surprisingly open upon their return.\n\nThe detective arrives on the scene at dawn, tasked with taking charge of the investigation. He methodically examines the study and interviews the two servants and Mr. Vincent himself. The study is described as simply furnished: besides the damaged escritoire, there are several chairs (two overturned), a round table, and a mantelpiece adorned with various items, including pipes, pistols, boxing gloves, and foils—the latter a detail of interest as one foil is missing, and the button is broken off another foil. Near the desk, investigators find a wood-chopping hatchet, the broken foil beneath the table, and intriguingly, a small green-stone idol hidden under the fireplace fender. These items hint at clues that will carry the story forward.\n\nThe cook, having bravely returned to the house despite her shock and fortified by brandy, confirms the timeline and circumstances of the servants' absence, emphasizing the devotion and harmonious relationship of the Vincents and affirming that neither she nor the housemaid knows of any enemies. The housemaid supplements the evidence by identifying the hatchet as belonging to the woodshed and noting that no other rooms in the house appeared disturbed.\n\nMr. Vincent, upon being gently questioned, presents as a deeply grief-stricken husband, barely able to articulate his feelings or recall details with composure. He recounts a seemingly straightforward alibi: he left the house around ten in the morning on business in the City and intended to return at midnight. His wife was reportedly in good health and spirits when last seen. He is both shocked and puzzled by the violent intrusion and murder.\n\nThe detective probes into the question of motive and opportunity. He points out that robbery was apparently the primary goal, given the destruction of the desk and missing banknotes. Vincent confirms that the two hundred pounds, in four fifty-pound notes, were locked in the drawer and unmistakably missing. The detective inquires whether anyone else knew about the money’s location or the vulnerability of the house during the servants’ absence. Here, Vincent admits he told a man named Roy—the only person besides his wife aware of the money’s whereabouts and the supposed emptiness of the house.\n\nThis disclosure forms a key plot pivot. Vincent explains that he had recently lost two hundred pounds to Roy during a card game and had safely locked it in the desk until he could repay the debt. When Roy urgently requested a £100 loan the night before the murder, Vincent offered a cheque, but Roy insisted on cash. In response, Vincent casually disclosed that the money was at home but claimed the house was empty, expecting his wife to be elsewhere and the servants away. Roy left looking distressed but neither Vincent nor the detective definitively accuses him.\n\nThe detective boldly hypothesizes a motive and modus operandi for Roy: armed with the knowledge that the house was unoccupied, Roy could have entered through the open back door, taken the hatchet from the woodshed to break into the desk, and in a panicked rage when confronted by Mrs. Vincent, seized a fencing foil from the mantelpiece to kill her before escaping with the money. He recognizes this is a fragile theory without concrete evidence and makes it clear to Vincent that no arrest will be made yet. Instead, he plans to watch for the spent banknotes, which Vincent has helpfully provided the serial numbers for—a prudent measure giving a tool for eventual identification of the culprit if they attempt to use the stolen cash.\n\nDespite the Detective’s suspicions, Vincent seems reluctant to believe in Roy’s guilt, underscoring the emotional difficulty in confronting the possibility that the crime was committed by someone within their acquaintance or circle. The narrative closes with the detective recording the note numbers, anchoring the investigation in this tangible lead and allowing the mystery to deepen.\n\nIn summary, the first segment of \"The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker\" introduces a realistic detective protagonist who foregrounds chance as a critical factor in crime-solving. The case centers on the brutal murder of Mrs. Vincent in an apparently motiveless attack linked to a robbery of a sizable sum of money. The husband's revealing of suspect Roy, the missing items (notably the green-stone idol and fencing foil), and the carefully documented details of the crime scene combine to construct a compelling mystery—one laced with personal tragedy and social respectability—poised for further unraveling in the succeeding parts."

        "chunk_text": "“I don’t know. I should like to know his movements on that night.”\n“I cannot tell you. He saw me at the Chestnut Club about seven o’clock and left immediately afterwards. I kept my business appointment, went to Alhambra, and then returned home.”\n“Give me Roy’s address and describe his personal appearance.”\n“He is a medical student, and lodges at No. — Gower Street. Tall, fair-haired — a good-looking young fellow.”\n“And his dress last night?”\n“He wore evening dress concealed by a fawn-coloured overcoat.”\nI duly noted these particulars, and I was about to take my leave, when I recollected the green-stone idol. It was so strange an object to find in prosaic Brixton that I could not help thinking it must have come there by accident.\n“By the way, Mr. Vincent,” said I, producing the monstrosity, “is this green-stone god your property?”\n“I never saw it before,” replied he, taking it in his hand. “Is it — ah!” he added, dropping the idol, “there is blood on it!”\n“Tis the blood of your wife, sir! If it does not belong to you, it does to the murderer. From the position in which this was found I fancy it slipped out of his breast-pocket as he stood over his victim. As you see, it is stained with blood. He must have lost his presence of mind, else he would not have left behind so damning a piece of evidence. This idol, sir, will hang the assassin of Mrs Vincent!”\n“I hope so, but unless you are sure of Roy, do not mar his life by accusing him of this crime.”\n“I certainly should not arrest him without sufficient proof,” I answered promptly, and so took my departure.\nVincent showed up very well in this preliminary conversation. Much as he desired to punish the criminal, yet he was unwilling to subject Roy to possibly unfounded suspicions. Had I not forced the club episode out of him I doubt whether he would have told it. As it was, the information gave me the necessary clue. Roy alone knew that the notes were in the escritoire, and imagined (owing to the mistake of Vincent) that the house was empty. Determined to have the money at any price (his own words), he intended but robbery, till the unexpected appearance of Mrs Vincent merged the lesser in the greater crime.\nMy first step was to advise the Bank that four fifty-pound notes, numbered so and so, were stolen, and that the thief or his deputy would probably change them within a reasonable period. I did not say a word about the crime, and kept all special details out of the newspapers; for as the murderer would probably read up the reports so as to shape his course by the action of the police, I judged it wiser that he should know as little as possible. Those minute press notices do more harm than good. They gratify the morbid appetite of the public, and put the criminal on his guard. Thereby the police work in the dark, but he — thanks to the posting up of special reporters — knows the doings of the law, and baffles it accordingly.\nThe green-stone idol worried me considerably. I wanted to know how it had got into the study of Ulster Lodge. When I knew that, I could nail my man. But there was considerable difficulty to overcome before such knowledge was available. Now a curiosity of this kind is not a common object in this country. A man who owns one must have come from New Zealand or have obtained it from a New Zealand friend. He could not have picked it up in London. If he did, he would not carry it constantly about with him. It was therefore my idea that the murderer had received the idol from a friend on the day of the crime. That friend, to possess such an idol, must have been in communication with New Zealand. The chain of thought is somewhat complicated, but it began with curiosity about the idol, and ended in my looking up the list of steamers going to the Antipodes. Then I carried out a little design which need not be mentioned at this moment. In due time it will fit in with the hanging of Mrs Vincent’s assassin. Meanwhile, I followed up the clue of the banknotes, and left the green-stone idol to evolve its own destiny. Thus I had two strings to my bow.\nThe crime was committed on the twentieth of June, and on the twenty-third two fifty-pound notes, with numbers corresponding to those stolen, were paid into the Bank of England. I was astonished at the little care exercised by the criminal in concealing his crime, but still more so when I learned that the money had been banked by a very respectable solicitor. Furnished with the address, I called on this gentleman. Mr Maudsley received me politely, and he had no hesitation in telling me how the notes had come into his possession. I did not state my primary reason for the inquiry.\n“I hope there is no trouble about these notes,” said he when I explained my errand. “I have had sufficient already.”\n“Indeed, Mr Maudsley, and in what way?”\nFor answer he touched the bell, and when it was answered, “Ask Mr Ford to step this way,” he said. Then turning to me, “I must reveal what I had hoped to keep secret, but I trust the revelation will remain with yourself.”\n“That is as I may decide after hearing it. I am a detective, Mr Maudsley, and you may be sure, I do not make these inquiries out of idle curiosity.”\nBefore he could reply, a slender, weak-looking young man, nervously excited, entered the room. This was Mr Ford, and he looked from me to Maudsley with some apprehension.\n“This gentleman,” said his employer, not unkindly, “comes from Scotland Yard about the money you paid me two days ago.”\n“It is all right, I hope?” stammered Ford, turning red and pale and red again.\n“Where did you get the money?” I asked, parrying this question.\n“From my sister.”\nI started when I heard this answer, and with good reason. My inquiries about Roy had revealed that he was in love with a hospital nurse whose name was Clara Ford. Without doubt she had obtained the notes from Roy after he had stolen them from Ulster Lodge. But why the necessity of the robbery?\n“Why did you get a hundred pounds from your sister?” I asked Ford.\nHe did not answer, but looked appealingly at Maudsley. That gentleman interposed.\n“We must make a clean breast of it, Ford,” he said with a sigh. “If you have committed a second crime to conceal the first, I cannot help you. This time matters are not at my discretion.”\n“I have committed no crime,” said Ford desperately, turning to me. “Sir, I may as well admit that I embezzled one hundred pounds from Mr Maudsley to pay a gambling debt. He kindly and most generously consented to overlook the delinquency if I replaced the money. Not having it myself I asked my sister. She, a poor hospital nurse, had not the amount. Yet, as non-payment meant ruin to me, she asked a Mr Julian Roy to help her. He at once agreed to do so, and gave her two fifty-pound notes. She handed them to me, and I gave them to Mr Maudsley who paid them into the bank.”\nThis, then, was the reason of Roy’s remark. He did not refer to his own ruin, but to that of Ford. To save this unhappy man, and for love of the sister, he had committed the crime. I did not need to see Clara Ford, but at once made up my mind to arrest Roy. The case was perfectly clear, and I was fully justified in taking this course. Meanwhile I made Maudsley and his clerk promise silence, as I did not wish Roy to be put on his guard by Miss Ford, through her brother.\n“Gentlemen,” I said, after a few moments’ pause, “I cannot at present explain my reasons for asking these questions, as it would take too long and I have no time to lose. Keep silent about this interview till tomorrow, and by that time you shall know all.”\n“Has Ford got into fresh trouble?” asked Maudsley anxiously.\n“No, but some one else has.”\n“My sister,” began Ford faintly, when I interrupted him at once.\n“Your sister is all right, Mr Ford. Pray trust in my discretion. No harm shall come to her or to you, if I can help it — but, above all, be silent.”\nThis they readily promised, and I returned to Scotland Yard, quite satisfied that Roy would get no warning. The evidence was so clear that I could not doubt the guilt of Roy. Else how had he come in possession of the notes? Already there was sufficient proof to hang him, yet I hoped to clinch the certainty by proving his ownership of the green-stone idol. It did not belong to Vincent, or to his dead wife, yet some one must have brought it into the study. Why not Roy, who, to all appearances, had committed the crime, the more so as the image was splashed with the victim’s blood? There was no difficulty in obtaining a warrant, and with this I went off to Gower Street.\nRoy loudly protested his innocence. He denied all knowledge of the crime and of the idol. I expected the denial, but I was astonished at the defence he put forth. It was very ingenious, but so manifestly absurd that it did not shake my belief in his guilt. I let him talk himself out — which perhaps was wrong — but he would not be silent, and then I took him off in a cab.\n“I swear I did not commit the crime,” he said passionately. “No one was more astonished than I at the news of Mrs Vincent’s death.”\n“Yet you were at Ulster Lodge on the night in question?”",

No harm shall come to her or to you, if I can help it — but, above all, be silent.”\nThis they readily promised, and I returned to Scotland Yard, quite satisfied that Roy would get no warning. The evidence was so clear that I could not doubt the guilt of Roy. Else how had he come in possession of the notes? Already there was sufficient proof to hang him, yet I hoped to clinch the certainty by proving his ownership of the green-stone idol. It did not belong to Vincent, or to his dead wife, yet some one must have brought it into the study. Why not Roy, who, to all appearances, had committed the crime, the more so as the image was splashed with the victim’s blood? There was no difficulty in obtaining a warrant, and with this I went off to Gower Street.\nRoy loudly protested his innocence. He denied all knowledge of the crime and of the idol. I expected the denial, but I was astonished at the defence he put forth. It was very ingenious, but so manifestly absurd that it did not shake my belief in his guilt. I let him talk himself out — which perhaps was wrong — but he would not be silent, and then I took him off in a cab.\n“I swear I did not commit the crime,” he said passionately. “No one was more astonished than I at the news of Mrs Vincent’s death.”\n“Yet you were at Ulster Lodge on the night in question?”\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

        "summary": "Continuing from the initial segment, “The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker” deepens into the investigation of the brutal and baffling murder of Mrs. Paul Vincent, a tragic case marked by an apparent lack of motive but framed by a violent home invasion and robbery. The narrative unfolds through the perspective of a pragmatic detective who repeatedly emphasizes the role of chance alongside deduction in solving crimes, dismissing the sensationalized mythology often surrounding detective work.\n\nThe story begins by introducing the respectable and seemingly harmonious life of Mr. and Mrs. Vincent, a middle-class couple living in Brixton. Paul Vincent, a moderately wealthy stockbroker and tennis enthusiast, and his beautiful, talented wife represented an ideal domestic picture. However, their peaceful existence is shattered when Mrs. Vincent is found stabbed to death in their study, the scene in disarray—furniture overturned, drawers violently ransacked, and a substantial sum of money, two hundred pounds in banknotes, stolen from a locked drawer.\n\nThe timing of the crime, between five in the evening and the discovery of the body near the back door upon the servants’ return late at night, presents a narrow window during which the intruder must have acted. The presence of an open back door indicates a point of ingress, but investigators find little else disturbed beyond the study, heightening the sense that the killer knew the household well. Mr. Vincent was away on business in the City, and the two servants — the cook and the housemaid — were attending a wedding, leaving Mrs. Vincent alone.\n\nAs the detective meticulously examines the scene and interviews all involved, key clues emerge. Among the items discovered is a curious green-stone idol tucked under the fireplace fender, bizarre and out of place in the modest London home. Additionally, a fencing foil is missing, and a button is broken off another foil found on the mantelpiece, hinting at a struggle. The presence of a wood-chopping hatchet, apparently from the woodshed, and a broken foil under the table further confirm the violent nature of the confrontation.\n\nThe crux of the initial inquiry lies in the disclosure by Mr. Vincent regarding a man named Julian Roy, a medical student who alone besides Mrs. Vincent knew about the two hundred pounds locked away in the desk. The detective deduces a likely motive and method: Roy, having lost money to Vincent in a card game and urgently requesting a loan, may have remembered Vincent’s claim that the house was empty, leading him to attempt a robbery. The sudden appearance of Mrs. Vincent would have forced him to escalate his unlawful intentions to murder in a panicked rush.\n\nThe detective, careful not to make premature accusations, refrains from publicizing details of the crime or the stolen banknotes fully, opting instead to quietly notify the bank of the specific serial numbers so that any attempt to exchange the currency might lead to identification. This strategic silence prevents the perpetrator from gaining advance knowledge of the investigation’s progress and helps avoid alerting him to alter his plans.\n\nThe green-stone idol becomes a focal point of curiosity and suspicion. Its foreign origin strongly suggests a connection to New Zealand, hinting that its presence in Ulster Lodge is no accident. The detective speculates the idol was brought to the crime scene by the murderer, possibly gifted on the day of the murder by an associate with ties to the Antipodes. This line of thought leads the detective to examine shipping records for New Zealand-bound vessels, although the full import of this clue remains under wraps, intended to be unveiled strategically later in the case.\n\nMeanwhile, the plot thickens with new developments involving the stolen notes. Just three days after the crime, two of the stolen fifty-pound notes are deposited at the Bank of England by a respectable solicitor named Mr. Maudsley. Upon investigation, the solicitor reveals that the money came from a nervous young clerk named Mr. Ford. Ford admits to obtaining the money from his sister, a hospital nurse named Clara Ford, who in turn received it from Julian Roy. This chain reveals a secondary crime: Ford embezzled funds from Maudsley to cover a gambling debt, and his sister, unable to pay, sought help from Roy, thus ensnaring multiple parties in the financial fallout of the initial robbery and murder.\n\nThis revelation shifts the detective’s understanding of Roy’s motivations. Rather than a reckless individual acting solely for personal gain, Roy appears driven by a mix of desperation and loyalty, willing to commit crime to aid a man whose love for a nurse compels him to desperate measures. Nonetheless, the evidence steadily mounts against Roy, and the detective resolves to arrest him, convinced by the trajectory of stolen notes and the connections established.\n\nThe arrest at Roy’s lodgings on Gower Street is marked by Roy’s vehement denials. Despite disavowing any knowledge of the crime or the green-stone idol, his defense is unconvincing and fraught with contradictions. The detective notes the ingenuity but ultimate futility of Roy’s arguments, and the refusal to remain silent only strengthens suspicion. The detective confronts Roy directly with the inconsistencies and the undeniable facts of his presence at Ulster Lodge on the night of the murder.\n\nThroughout the investigation, Mr. Vincent displays admirable restraint and integrity, expressing both his sorrow over his wife’s death and his reluctance to falsely accuse an acquaintance without definitive proof. His guarded demeanor underscores the emotional and social complexities inherent in crimes involving acquaintances or close social circles.\n\nIn sum, the second segment of “The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker” significantly advances the investigation, weaving together forensic clues, financial trails, and human relationships to sharpen the focus on Julian Roy as the prime suspect. The detective’s dual approach—quietly tracking the stolen banknotes while unraveling the enigmatic presence of the New Zealand green-stone idol—positions the case on the cusp of resolution yet still retains key mysteries. Roy’s arrest looms as a turning point, but his protests and the unexplained symbol hint at deeper layers waiting to be uncovered, sustaining the story’s tension and intrigue as it moves toward its climax."

I asked Vincent for a hundred pounds, and —”\n“Of course you did, to give to Miss Ford.”\n“How do you know that?” he asked sharply.\n“From her brother, through Maudsley. He paid the notes supplied by you into the bank.

I asked him at the Chestnut Club for one hundred pounds. He had not that much on him, but said that two hundred were in his desk at home. As it was imperative that I should have the money on the night, I asked him to let me go down for it.”\n“And he refused!”\n“He did not. He consented, and gave me a note to Mrs Vincent, instructing her to hand me over a hundred pounds. I went to Brixton, got the money in two fifties, and gave them to Miss Ford. When I left Ulster Lodge, between eight and nine, Mrs Vincent was in perfect health, and quite happy.”\n“An ingenious defence,” said I doubtfully, “but Vincent absolutely denies that he gave you the money.”\nRoy stared hard at me to see if I were joking. Evidently the attitude of Vincent puzzled him greatly.\n“That is ridiculous,” said he quietly. “He wrote a note to his wife instructing her to hand me the money.”\n“Where is that note?”\n“I gave it to Mrs Vincent.”\n“It cannot be found,” I answered. “If such a note were in her possession it would now be in mine.”\n“Don’t you believe me?”\n“How can I against the evidence of those notes and the denial of Vincent?”\n“But he surely does not deny that he gave me the money?”\n“He does.”\n“He must be mad,” said Roy in dismay. “One of my best friends, and to tell so great a falsehood. Why, if —”\n“You had better be silent,” I said, weary of this foolish talk. “If what you say is true, Vincent will exonerate you from complicity in the crime. If things occurred as you say, there is no sense in his denial.”\nThis latter remark was made to stop the torrent of his speech. It was not my business to listen to incriminating declarations, or to ingenious defences. All that sort of thing is for judge and jury; therefore I ended the conversation as above, and marched off my prisoner. Whether the birds of the air carry news I do not know, but they must have been busy on this occasion, for next morning every newspaper in London was congratulating me on my clever capture of the supposed murderer. Some detectives would have been gratified by this public laudation — I was not. Roy’s passionate protestations of innocence made me feel uneasy, and I doubted whether, after all, I had the right man under lock and key. Yet the evidence was strong against him. He admitted having been with Mrs Vincent on the fatal night; he admitted possession of two fifty-pound notes. His only defence was the letter of the stockbroker, and this was missing — if, indeed, it had ever been written.\nVincent was terribly upset by the arrest of Roy. He liked the young man and he had believed in his innocence so far as was possible. But in the face of such strong evidence, he was forced to believe him guilty. Yet he blamed himself severely that he had not lent the money and so averted the catastrophe.\n“I had no idea that the matter was of such moment,” he said to me, “else I would have gone down to Brixton myself and have given him the money. Then his frenzy would have spared my wife and himself a death on the scaffold.”\n“What do you think of his defence?”\n“It is wholly untrue. I did not write a note, nor did I tell him to go to Brixton. Why should I, when I fully believed no one was in the house?”\n“It was a pity you did not go home, Mr Vincent, instead of to the Alhambra.”\n“It was a mistake,” he assented, “but I had no idea Roy would attempt the robbery. Besides, I was under engagement to go to the theatre with my friend Dr Monson.”\n“Do you think that idol belongs to Roy?”\n“I can’t say. I never saw it in his possession. Why?”\n“Because I firmly believe that if Roy had not the idol in his pocket on that fatal night he is innocent. Oh, you look astonished, but the man who murdered your wife owns that idol.”\nThe morning after this conversation a lady called at Scotland Yard and asked to see me concerning the Brixton case. Fortunately, I was then in the neighbourhood, and, guessing who she was, I afforded her the interview she sought. When all left the room she raised her veil, and I saw before me a noble-looking woman, somewhat resembling Mr Maudsley’s clerk. Yet, by some contradiction of nature, her face was the more virile of the two.\n“You are Miss Ford,” I said, guessing her identity.\n“I am Clara Ford,” she answered quietly. “I have come to see you about Mr Roy.”\n“I am afraid nothing can be done to save him.”\n“Something must be done,” she said passionately. “We are engaged to be married, and all a woman can do to save her lover I will do. Do you believe him to be guilty?”\n“In the face of such evidence, Miss Ford —”\n“I don’t care what evidence is against him,” she retorted. “He is as innocent of the crime as I am. Do you think that a man fresh from the committal of a crime would place the money won by that crime in the hands of the woman he professes to love? I tell you he is innocent.”",

        "summary": "“The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker” is a detective story that meticulously chronicles the investigation into the brutal murder of Mrs. Paul Vincent, weaving together human frailty, financial deception, and enigmatic artifacts within a layered narrative steeped in psychological insight and methodical detective work.\n\nThe story begins with the tragic discovery of Mrs. Vincent’s body in the study at their Brixton home, Ulster Lodge, marked by signs of violent struggle and robbery, including the theft of two hundred pounds from a locked drawer. Mr. Vincent, a stockbroker often away on business, had left his wife alone with the servants absent attending a wedding, creating a narrow window for the crime. The rear door was found open, indicating forced entry or escape, yet the scene’s details suggested the killer was no mere intruder but someone familiar with the household dynamics.\n\nInspector and narrator of the story approaches the investigation with a clear-eyed pragmatism, challenging romantic notions of detective work as solely a product of genius and instead emphasizing careful observation, chance, and logical deduction. Early clues include the discovery of a broken fencing foil and the missing counterpart, a wood-chopping hatchet found at the scene, and, intriguingly, a green-stone idol of foreign, likely New Zealand, origin hidden under the fireplace—a mysterious piece whose significance remains elusive for much of the story.\n\nA critical development in the investigation is the identification of Julian Roy, a medical student and a known acquaintance of Mr. Vincent. Roy had earlier lost money to Vincent at cards and was presumed to have approached Vincent for a loan, supposedly to assist a woman named Clara Ford, whose brother was entangled in embezzlement. The trail of the stolen banknotes, traced through a solicitor named Maudsley, revealed a complicated chain of debts and desperation involving this Ford family and Julian Roy, suggesting a motive for the robbery and murder tied to financial desperation rather than random violence or personal animus.\n\nThe detective’s strategy unfolds with subtlety: by quietly informing banks of the stolen notes and withholding certain facts from the public and suspects, he maneuvers to trap the perpetrator. This approach culminates in the arrest of Julian Roy at his Gower Street lodgings. Roy’s immediate protestations of innocence and his complex defense claim that he had been at Ulster Lodge not to rob or kill, but at Mr. Vincent’s behest, having arranged to collect a hundred pounds to help Clara Ford pay off her brother’s debts. He asserts that Vincent had consented and sent a note authorizing Mrs. Vincent to release the money, maintaining that upon his departure from the house, Mrs. Vincent was unharmed and in good spirits.\n\nThis defense, however, is met with skepticism. Mr. Vincent vehemently denies having given Roy any money or sending such a note, thereby casting doubt on Roy’s claims and intensifying the evidentiary cloud over him. The detective, though recognizing the ingenuity and passion behind Roy’s defense, chooses restraint, understanding that the evaluation of evidence and innocence is ultimately the prerogative of the court, not the investigator. The newspapers, however, prematurely celebrate the arrest, lauding the detective’s acumen, a reaction the detective himself views with unease given lingering doubts about Roy’s guilt.\n\nSimultaneously, Mr. Vincent grapples with guilt and regret, feeling responsible for not having lent Roy the money personally, a gesture he speculates might have averted both the robbery and his wife’s death. His presence at the Alhambra theatre on the night, rather than at home, becomes an element of tragic misjudgment in his view, compounded by the stark denials he offers concerning the money and the circumstances of that evening.\n\nCentral to the detective’s suspicions is the enigmatic green-stone idol. He firmly believes that possession of the idol on that fatal night is a defining factor for innocence, implying that whoever had this Maori artifact was the true murderer, and that Roy’s custody of the idol or lack thereof on the night in question is a crucial detail in establishing the truth. The idol’s unexpected presence, its foreign provenance, and the detective’s conviction about its significance add a layer of mystery, suggesting that the crime might have roots extending beyond the immediate financial motives.\n\nThe story escalates when Clara Ford herself visits Scotland Yard to advocate passionately for Julian Roy’s innocence. Revealing her engagement to Roy, she challenges the detective’s pragmatism by appealing to the profundity of personal trust and love, arguing that a man fresh from committing such a heinous crime would not entrust poisoned fruit—i.e., stolen money—to the woman he professes to love. Her steadfast belief in Roy’s innocence introduces a personal dimension to the case, underlining the emotional stakes and casting ambiguity over the seeming clarity of the circumstantial evidence.\n\nThis segment deepens the narrative by presenting Roy’s side of the story in full, juxtaposed against Mr. Vincent’s denials and the detective’s probing doubts. It highlights the intricate web of financial desperation, personal loyalties, and social appearances that complicate the search for truth. The detective’s professional skepticism and internal reflections show the difficulty of weighing conflicting testimonies, especially when those involved are entwined by friendship, love, and grief.\n\nTogether, these developments maintain high tension as the investigation moves toward resolution. The detective’s conviction that the idol-clad murderer is yet at large injects dramatic irony, given Roy’s incarceration and public vilification. The narrative invites readers to question appearances and consider the interplay between motive, opportunity, and the tangible symbols—like the green-stone idol—that might unlock hidden truths.\n\nIn summary, the story artfully combines meticulous police procedure, psychological complexity, and symbolic intrigue. The murder mystery is not merely a puzzle of who did it but also a meditation on human frailty, the consequences of oversight, and the sometimes misleading nature of evidence. The contrasting testimonies of Roy, Vincent, and Clara Ford, alongside the detective’s steady but cautious reasoning, create a compelling tableau that challenges readers to look beyond surface facts and consider the deeper story woven through “The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker.”"

        "chunk_text": "“Mr Vincent doesn’t think so.”\n“Mr Vincent!” said Miss Ford, with scornful emphasis. “Oh, yes! I quite believe he would think Julian guilty.”\n“Surely not if it were possible to think otherwise! He is, or rather was, a staunch friend to Mr Roy.”\n“So staunch that he tried to break off the match between us. Listen to me, sir. I have told no one before, but I tell you now. Mr Vincent is a villain. He pretended to be the friend of Julian, and yet he dared to make proposals to me — dishonourable proposals, for which I could have struck him. He, a married man, a pretended friend, wished me to leave Julian and fly with him.”\n“Surely you are mistaken, Miss Ford. Mr Vincent was most devoted to his wife.”\n“He did not care at all for his wife,” she replied steadily. “He was in love with me. To save Julian annoyance I did not tell him the insults offered to me by Mr Vincent. Now that Julian is in trouble by an unfortunate mistake Mr Vincent is delighted.”\n“It is impossible. I assure you Vincent is very sorry to —”\n“You do not believe me,” she said, interrupting. “Very well, I shall give you proof of the truth. Come to my brother’s rooms in Bloomsbury. I shall send for Mr Vincent, and if you are concealed you shall hear from his own lips how glad he is that my lover and his wife are removed from the path of his dishonourable passion.”\n“I will come, Miss Ford, but I think you are mistaken in Vincent.”\n“You shall see,” she replied coldly. Then, with a sudden change of tone, “Is there no way of saving Julian? I am sure that he is innocent. Appearances are against him, but it was not he who committed the crime. Is there no way?”\nMoved by her earnest appeal, I produced the green-stone idol, and told her all I had done in connection with it. She listened eagerly, and readily grasped at the hope thus held out to her of saving Roy. When in possession of all the facts she considered in silence for some two minutes. At the end of that time she drew down her veil and prepared to take her departure.\n“Come to my brother’s rooms in Alfred Place, near Tottenham Court Road,” said she, holding out her hand. “I promise you that there you shall see Mr Vincent in his true character. Good-bye till Monday at three o’clock.”\nFrom the colour in her face and the bright light in her eye, I guessed that she had some scheme in her head for the saving of Roy. I think myself clever, but after that interview at Alfred Place I declare I am but a fool compared to this woman. She put two and two together, ferreted out unguessed-of evidence, and finally produced the most wonderful result. When she left me at this moment the greenstone idol was in her pocket. With that she hoped to prove the innocence of her lover and the guilt of another person. It was the cleverest thing I ever saw in my life.\nThe inquest on the body of Mrs Vincent resulted in a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown. Then she was buried, and all London waited for the trial of Roy. He was brought up charged with the crime, reserved his defence, and in due course he was committed for trial. Meantime I called on Miss Ford at the appointed time, and found her alone.\n“Mr Vincent will be here shortly,” she said calmly. “I see Julian is committed for trial.”\n“And he has reserved his defence.”\n“I shall defend him” said she with a strange look in her face. “I am not afraid for him now. He saved my unhappy brother. I shall save him.”\n“Have you discovered anything?”\n“I have discovered a good deal. Hush! That is Mr Vincent,” she added, as a cab drew up to the door. “Hide yourself behind this curtain and do not appear until I give you the signal.”\nWondering what she was about to do, I concealed myself as directed. The next moment Vincent was in the room, and then ensued one of the strangest of scenes. She received him coldly, and motioned him to a seat. Vincent was nervous, but she might have been of stone, so little emotion did she display.\n“I have sent for you, Mr Vincent,” she said, “to ask for your help in releasing Julian.”\n“How can I help you?” he answered in amazement — “willingly would I do so, but it is out of my power.”\n“I don’t think it is!”\n“I assure you, Clara,” he began eagerly, when she cut him short.\n“Yes, call me Clara! Say that you love me! Lie, like all men, and yet refuse to do what I wish.”\n“I am not going to help Julian to marry you,” declared he sullenly. “You know that I love you — I love you dearly, I wish to marry you —”\n“Is not that declaration rather soon after the death of your wife?”\n“My wife is gone, poor soul. Let her rest.”\n“Yet you loved her?”\n“I never loved her,” he said, rising to his feet. “I love you! From the first moment I saw you I loved you. My wife is dead! Julian Roy is in prison on a charge of murdering her. With these obstacles removed there is no reason why we should not marry.”\n“If I marry you,” she said slowly, “will you help Julian to refute this charge?”\n“I cannot! The evidence is too strong against him!”\n“You know that he is innocent, Mr Vincent.”\n“I do not! I believe that he murdered my wife.”\n“You believe that he murdered your wife,” she reiterated, coming a step nearer and holding out the green-stone idol—“do you believe that he dropped this in the study when his hand struck the fatal blow?”\n“I don’t know!” he said, cooly glancing at the idol. “I never saw it before.”\n“Think again, Mr Vincent — think again. Who was it that went to the Alhambra at eight o’clock with Dr Monson and met there the captain of a New Zealand steamer with whom he was acquainted?”\n“It was I,” said Vincent defiantly, “and what of that?”",
        "prompt": "Continue summarizing Detective story 'The Green-Stone God And The Stockbroker' by Unknown. This is part 4 of 4 segments. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-3):\n“The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker” is a detective story that meticulously chronicles the investigation into the brutal murder of Mrs. Paul Vincent, weaving together human frailty, financial deception, and enigmatic artifacts within a layered narrative steeped in psychological insight and methodical detective work.\n\nThe story begins with the tragic discovery of Mrs. Vincent’s body in the study at their Brixton home, Ulster Lodge, marked by signs of violent struggle and robbery, including the theft of two hundred pounds from a locked drawer. Mr. Vincent, a stockbroker often away on business, had left his wife alone with the servants absent attending a wedding, creating a narrow window for the crime. The rear door was found open, indicating forced entry or escape, yet the scene’s details suggested the killer was no mere intruder but someone familiar with the household dynamics.\n\nInspector and narrator of the story approaches the investigation with a clear-eyed pragmatism, challenging romantic notions of detective work as solely a product of genius and instead emphasizing careful observation, chance, and logical deduction. Early clues include the discovery of a broken fencing foil and the missing counterpart, a wood-chopping hatchet found at the scene, and, intriguingly, a green-stone idol of foreign, likely New Zealand, origin hidden under the fireplace—a mysterious piece whose significance remains elusive for much of the story.\n\nA critical development in the investigation is the identification of Julian Roy, a medical student and a known acquaintance of Mr. Vincent. Roy had earlier lost money to Vincent at cards and was presumed to have approached Vincent for a loan, supposedly to assist a woman named Clara Ford, whose brother was entangled in embezzlement. The trail of the stolen banknotes, traced through a solicitor named Maudsley, revealed a complicated chain of debts and desperation involving this Ford family and Julian Roy, suggesting a motive for the robbery and murder tied to financial desperation rather than random violence or personal animus.\n\nThe detective’s strategy unfolds with subtlety: by quietly informing banks of the stolen notes and withholding certain facts from the public and suspects, he maneuvers to trap the perpetrator. This approach culminates in the arrest of Julian Roy at his Gower Street lodgings. Roy’s immediate protestations of innocence and his complex defense claim that he had been at Ulster Lodge not to rob or kill, but at Mr. Vincent’s behest, having arranged to collect a hundred pounds to help Clara Ford pay off her brother’s debts. He asserts that Vincent had consented and sent a note authorizing Mrs. Vincent to release the money, maintaining that upon his departure from the house, Mrs. Vincent was unharmed and in good spirits.\n\nThis defense, however, is met with skepticism. Mr. Vincent vehemently denies having given Roy any money or sending such a note, thereby casting doubt on Roy’s claims and intensifying the evidentiary cloud over him. The detective, though recognizing the ingenuity and passion behind Roy’s defense, chooses restraint, understanding that the evaluation of evidence and innocence is ultimately the prerogative of the court, not the investigator. The newspapers, however, prematurely celebrate the arrest, lauding the detective’s acumen, a reaction the detective himself views with unease given lingering doubts about Roy’s guilt.\n\nSimultaneously, Mr. Vincent grapples with guilt and regret, feeling responsible for not having lent Roy the money personally, a gesture he speculates might have averted both the robbery and his wife’s death. His presence at the Alhambra theatre on the night, rather than at home, becomes an element of tragic misjudgment in his view, compounded by the stark denials he offers concerning the money and the circumstances of that evening.\n\nCentral to the detective’s suspicions is the enigmatic green-stone idol. He firmly believes that possession of the idol on that fatal night is a defining factor for innocence, implying that whoever had this Maori artifact was the true murderer, and that Roy’s custody of the idol or lack thereof on the night in question is a crucial detail in establishing the truth. The idol’s unexpected presence, its foreign provenance, and the detective’s conviction about its significance add a layer of mystery, suggesting that the crime might have roots extending beyond the immediate financial motives.\n\nThe story escalates when Clara Ford herself visits Scotland Yard to advocate passionately for Julian Roy’s innocence. Revealing her engagement to Roy, she challenges the detective’s pragmatism by appealing to the profundity of personal trust and love, arguing that a man fresh from committing such a heinous crime would not entrust poisoned fruit—i.e., stolen money—to the woman he professes to love. Her steadfast belief in Roy’s innocence introduces a personal dimension to the case, underlining the emotional stakes and casting ambiguity over the seeming clarity of the circumstantial evidence.\n\nThis segment deepens the narrative by presenting Roy’s side of the story in full, juxtaposed against Mr. Vincent’s denials and the detective’s probing doubts. It highlights the intricate web of financial desperation, personal loyalties, and social appearances that complicate the search for truth. The detective’s professional skepticism and internal reflections show the difficulty of weighing conflicting testimonies, especially when those involved are entwined by friendship, love, and grief.\n\nTogether, these developments maintain high tension as the investigation moves toward resolution. The detective’s conviction that the idol-clad murderer is yet at large injects dramatic irony, given Roy’s incarceration and public vilification. The narrative invites readers to question appearances and consider the interplay between motive, opportunity, and the tangible symbols—like the green-stone idol—that might unlock hidden truths.\n\nIn summary, the story artfully combines meticulous police procedure, psychological complexity, and symbolic intrigue. The murder mystery is not merely a puzzle of who did it but also a meditation on human frailty, the consequences of oversight, and the sometimes misleading nature of evidence. The contrasting testimonies of Roy, Vincent, and Clara Ford, alongside the detective’s steady but cautious reasoning, create a compelling tableau that challenges readers to look beyond surface facts and consider the deeper story woven through “The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker.”\n\nCurrent segment (part 4):\n“Mr Vincent doesn’t think so.”\n“Mr Vincent!” said Miss Ford, with scornful emphasis. “Oh, yes! I quite believe he would think Julian guilty.”\n“Surely not if it were possible to think otherwise! He is, or rather was, a staunch friend to Mr Roy.”\n“So staunch that he tried to break off the match between us. Listen to me, sir. I have told no one before, but I tell you now. Mr Vincent is a villain. He pretended to be the friend of Julian, and yet he dared to make proposals to me — dishonourable proposals, for which I could have struck him. He, a married man, a pretended friend, wished me to leave Julian and fly with him.”\n“Surely you are mistaken, Miss Ford. Mr Vincent was most devoted to his wife.”\n“He did not care at all for his wife,” she replied steadily. “He was in love with me. To save Julian annoyance I did not tell him the insults offered to me by Mr Vincent. Now that Julian is in trouble by an unfortunate mistake Mr Vincent is delighted.”\n“It is impossible. I assure you Vincent is very sorry to —”\n“You do not believe me,” she said, interrupting. “Very well, I shall give you proof of the truth. Come to my brother’s rooms in Bloomsbury. I shall send for Mr Vincent, and if you are concealed you shall hear from his own lips how glad he is that my lover and his wife are removed from the path of his dishonourable passion.”\n“I will come, Miss Ford, but I think you are mistaken in Vincent.”\n“You shall see,” she replied coldly. Then, with a sudden change of tone, “Is there no way of saving Julian? I am sure that he is innocent. Appearances are against him, but it was not he who committed the crime. Is there no way?”\nMoved by her earnest appeal, I produced the green-stone idol, and told her all I had done in connection with it. She listened eagerly, and readily grasped at the hope thus held out to her of saving Roy. When in possession of all the facts she considered in silence for some two minutes. At the end of that time she drew down her veil and prepared to take her departure.\n“Come to my brother’s rooms in Alfred Place, near Tottenham Court Road,” said she, holding out her hand. “I promise you that there you shall see Mr Vincent in his true character. Good-bye till Monday at three o’clock.”\nFrom the colour in her face and the bright light in her eye, I guessed that she had some scheme in her head for the saving of Roy. I think myself clever, but after that interview at Alfred Place I declare I am but a fool compared to this woman. She put two and two together, ferreted out unguessed-of evidence, and finally produced the most wonderful result. When she left me at this moment the greenstone idol was in her pocket. With that she hoped to prove the innocence of her lover and the guilt of another person. It was the cleverest thing I ever saw in my life.\nThe inquest on the body of Mrs Vincent resulted in a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown. Then she was buried, and all London waited for the trial of Roy. He was brought up charged with the crime, reserved his defence, and in due course he was committed for trial.

Clara’s boldness and clever deductions strain against the limitations of formal detective procedure, providing a humanizing and dramatic counterpoint to the official inquiry.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the detective maintains a balanced, skeptical stance, wary of quick judgments and aware of the flaws in human testimony. The story critiques easy solutions, suggesting that evidence can mislead and that truths often lie beneath emotionally charged facades. The idol’s foreign provenance and mysterious presence in the scene of the crime tie the local tragedy to unexpected cultural and interpersonal complexities.\n\nIn summary, “The Green-Stone God and the Stockbroker” is a richly textured detective tale that blends meticulous police work with psychological and social insight.
