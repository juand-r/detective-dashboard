      "summary": "In the opening segment of the detective story \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg,\" the narrative introduces Norris, a man deeply disillusioned with his life on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Standing in the marketplace, Norris voices to three friends his growing weariness with the city’s relentless pace and superficial distractions—the ceaseless fluctuations of share prices, the social scene of men and women, the drinks and dances—all aspects of his life he now finds hollow and tiresome. He is no longer invested in the highs and lows of the market, feeling neither the urge to buy shares early nor to sell out at peak prices. Instead, he yearns simply to escape, to find peace and perhaps some sense of renewal away from the capital’s frenzied existence. Moreover, Norris anticipates an impending economic slump, which deepens his resolve to seek refuge on the veld, the open plains, where he believes he can live more cheaply and save money. This desire for a fresh start and detachment from the financial world frames his decision to take a holiday into the less developed regions of Southern Africa.\n\nAs Norris discusses his plans openly, another character, Teddy Isaacs, enters the scene, interrupting the conversation. Isaacs, newly arrived in Johannesburg and unfamiliar with local history and disputes, questions Norris about his intended destination, learning that Norris plans to travel to Manicaland, a region on the eastern frontier of present-day Zimbabwe (then part of British territory). Isaacs’s mention of \"Barrington\" prompts a notable reaction from Norris and his friends. To Isaacs, Barrington is merely an obscure figure—a man rumored to have vanished from Mashonaland about a year earlier. However, Norris and the others regard the name with significant weight and express irritation at Isaacs’s casual remark, reflecting deeper undercurrents of tension and grievance among the community of Uitlanders—foreigners living in the Transvaal, who often felt marginalized and aggrieved politically and socially.\n\nNorris calmly confirms to Isaacs that if he encounters Barrington during his expedition, he intends to bring him back. His assured response, combined with knowing looks and raised eyebrows among the listeners, suggests a complex history and unresolved conflict involving Barrington. Curiosity piqued, Isaacs inquires further and is provided with an outline of the background, albeit carefully withholding more scandalous or sensitive details. The story behind Norris and Barrington’s estrangement begins earlier in the Cape Colony, far to the south along South Africa’s coast, near Port Elizabeth, where they were once ostrich farmers living close to each other. Norris was married, Barrington was not, and a serious disagreement or personal scandal had driven a wedge between them. The full extent of the “ugly” affair remains undisclosed to Isaacs, but what emerges is a tale of friendship turned rivalry and hardship.\n\nSubsequently, Barrington abruptly left the Cape Colony, heading north to the Transvaal during the early days of Johannesburg’s establishment, when the town was still rudimentary and its mining industry just burgeoning. There, Barrington prospered greatly, capitalizing on early opportunities. Meanwhile, as the ostrich-farming industry declined, Norris’s fortunes waned, and, like many others displaced by changing economic currents, he too migrated to Johannesburg, essentially becoming part of the drift of down-and-out settlers seeking their luck on the Rand mines and stock markets.\n\nThe story climax of their rivalry unfolds on the bustling floor of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, where Norris and Barrington unexpectedly meet face to face. While observers initially expect a physical confrontation due to their fraught history, the opponents instead engage in a metaphorical duel waged through stock market dealings rather than weapons. Barrington’s superior acumen and clearer mind give him the advantage, allowing him to outmaneuver Norris financially, compounding the latter’s difficulties. Norris is likened to a man armed with a derringer trying to face a machine gun, underscoring the overwhelming odds against him. Still, the tables turn somewhat after Barrington’s mysterious disappearance; only then does Norris feel free to embark on his journey into Manicaland without the burden of his financial records haunting him.\n\nFully resolved, Norris prepares meticulously for his expedition into the wild and less-charted northeast. He acquires a substantial buck-wagon covered by a tent to serve as both transport and shelter, provisions for six months’ survival, a span of oxen for hauling heavy loads, and two horses specifically treated for \"thickhead sickness,\" a form of equine ailment common in the region. Understanding the need for skilled assistance, Norris hires a Griqua lad as a wagon driver—likely a young man of the semi-nomadic Griqua people, known for their adaptability on the veld—and also procures the services of half a dozen Matabele boys eager for an opportunity to return to their homeland.\n\nFrom Johannesburg, Norris’s route takes him to Makoni’s town near the famous Zimbabwe ruins, historically linked to the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe, signifying the journey’s deep penetration into African heartlands with their rich heritage and enigmatic sites. Here, with a few brass rings and an empty cartridge case as barter—a telling detail of frontier life and the value of even humble trinkets—Norris hires a Ma-ongwi boy who has prior experience navigating the Mashonaland plateau. This guide leads Norris to the headwaters of the Inyazuri River, where Norris establishes a campsite.\n\nThe chosen site is described vividly: it is set in grassy terrain speckled with large granite boulders and scattered woodlands. The guide’s local knowledge determines the exact location, about fifty yards west of a prominent ant-heap and some quarter of a mile from a dense forest of machabel trees. These geographic and botanical details offer more than mere setting; they underline the wildness and isolation of Norris’s chosen refuge, the untamed natural environment he is entering, and the survivalist challenge ahead. The Ma-ongwi boy’s familiarity with the spot—having camped there previously—offers a measure of reassurance amid the uncertain terrain.\n\nIn essence, this initial segment sets the stage for a story of rivalry, disappearance, and exploration against a backdrop of South African colonial and frontier life. Norris’s journey is both literal and metaphorical: a flight from personal defeat and social chaos toward an uncertain but resolute confrontation with the past, embodied by Barrington and the mysteries of the distant Mashonaland wilderness. The characters’ complex histories and the richly detailed setting foreshadow an intriguing narrative of pursuit, survival, and reconciliation in a land at the crossroads of empire and indigenous cultures. This careful introduction promises a detective tale infused with adventure, human drama, and the stark realities of life on the South African frontier."

      "summary": "The detective story \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg\" unfolds against the backdrop of early Johannesburg and the wild expanses of Southern Africa, intertwining themes of rivalry, survival, and the haunting past. The narrative centers on Norris, a man weary and disillusioned with the bustling Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the superficial trappings of urban life. In a candid conversation with friends in the Johannesburg marketplace, Norris confesses his profound dissatisfaction with the relentless ups and downs of the share market, the social distractions, and the city's frenetic pace. He predicts an impending economic slump and, rather than engaging further in the restless financial world, he resolves to seek refuge on the open veld—regions of undeveloped plains—hoping to live more cheaply and find peace.\n\nNorris’s plans attract the attention of Teddy Isaacs, a newcomer to Johannesburg unfamiliar with local tensions. When Isaacs mentions \"Barrington\" in passing, naming him as a man who disappeared from Mashonaland about a year prior, Norris and his friends react with marked irritation and unease. Barrington is not just any figure; to Norris and his circle, he embodies a deep-seated grievance and a personal conflict that weighs heavily. Norris’s calm but firm declaration that he intends to bring Barrington back if encountered conveys the seriousness of their unresolved history.\n\nThe story then steps back to reveal the origins of this fraught relationship between Norris and Barrington. Once ostrich farmers near Port Elizabeth in the Cape Colony, the two men were neighbors but sharply divided by a personal, scandalous dispute—details of which remain veiled to the curious Isaacs. Their falling out fractured a previously amicable or at least cordial acquaintance, and Barrington abruptly left the Cape Colony to seek fortune in the Transvaal at the dawn of Johannesburg’s rise. There, Barrington thrived amidst the chaos of early gold mining ventures, whereas Norris’s fortunes dwindled along with the ostrich industry. Norris, like many displaced by shifting economic tides, migrated to Johannesburg seeking new opportunities.\n\nThe climax of their rivalry unfolds dramatically on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange itself, where instead of a physical confrontation as feared, the two men engage in a metaphorical duel through financial maneuvers. Barrington’s superior skill overwhelms Norris, highlighting the disparity between them by likening Norris’s efforts to a derringer pistol against a machine gun. Despite Norris’s losses and eventual retreat, Barrington’s mysterious disappearance later opens a window for Norris to embark on his own journey into Manicaland, free from his financial entanglements.\n\nNorris prepares thoroughly for this expedition, acquiring a covered buck-wagon as shelter and transport, stocking ample provisions for six months, and recruiting a diverse team tailored to survive the African wilderness. He hires a Griqua boy to drive the wagon and a half dozen Matabele boys eager to return home. From Johannesburg, Norris heads to Makoni’s town near the storied ruins of Great Zimbabwe, acquiring a Ma-ongwi boy with local knowledge to guide him further into Mashonaland.\n\nThe chosen campsite lies in a grassy plain peppered with large granite boulders and scattered woodlands, near an ant-heap and a dense forest of machabel trees. This wild and isolated setting underscores the challenge Norris faces—entering a land that is both physically untamed and symbolically laden. The guide’s local insight lends Norris a measure of confidence amid the uncertainty.\n\nThe continuation of the story adds a profound layer of connection between Norris and Barrington’s enigmatic past. Norris inquires the Ma-ongwi boy about previous visits to the area, learning with surprise that the boy had been there twice—once three years ago and again just the previous year. Most startlingly, Barrington had been there last year. The boy confirms they have been following Barrington’s wagon-track, anchoring Barrington’s elusive presence to this very campsite.\n\nStirred by this revelation, Norris physically inspects the surroundings. He walks to a jasmine bush aligned with his camp fence’s opening, then traces a semicircle around the site until he discovers the wagon-track at the camp’s rear. This track abruptly stops here, with no indication of where Barrington might have gone north, east, or west. Norris realizes that the boy has deliberately chosen Barrington’s last known camping ground as theirs. There is an evocative irony in this choice, and Norris chuckles quietly at the thought that he is now \"standing in Barrington’s shoes.\" The implication is that Norris is confronting not only the wilderness but the literal and metaphorical footprints of his rival.\n\nThat night, as Norris smokes by the fire, he summons the Ma-ongwi boy from his hut behind the wagon, signaling the start of a deeper conversation that may uncover more about Barrington’s fate and the mysteries of the region. The scene suggests an anticipated alliance or at least a sharing of crucial knowledge that will drive the story forward.\n\nTogether, these segments establish a richly textured narrative blending personal rivalry and historical backdrop. Norris’s journey from urban disillusionment to the heart of Mashonaland reflects both an external adventure and an internal reckoning. The detailed setting—markets, mining towns, vast African plains, ancient ruins—and the varied cast of characters, including indigenous guides and settlers, situate the story at a dynamic intersection of colonial expansion, economic upheaval, and cultural encounter.\n\nMoreover, the motif of following tracks—both literal wagon trails and the figurative paths of past actions—symbolizes the detective element of the story. Norris is not merely traveling to a remote location; he is pursuing unresolved business, perhaps redemption or confrontation, tied intimately to Barrington’s disappearance and their shared history. The revelation that Barrington’s path ended here, and that Norris is deliberately occupying the same physical space, underscores the tension and inevitability of their intertwined fates.\n\nIn sum, the combined storyline up to this point portrays a man driven by disillusionment and a complex personal vendetta, transitioning from financial defeat to a frontier quest. Norris’s preparations and journey into the wild Mashonaland plateau position the narrative at the crossroads of justice, rivalry, and survival amid the shifting socio-political landscape of early 20th-century Southern Africa. The story promises to delve deeper into these themes as Norris engages more fully with the mysteries surrounding Barrington and the untamed land itself."

      "chunk_text": "\"Tell me how you lost him,\" said Norris.\n\"He rode that way alone after a sable antelope.\" The boy pointed an arm to the southwest. \"The beast was wounded, and we followed its blood-spoor. We found Mr. Barrington's horse gored by the antelope's horns. He himself had gone forward on foot. We tracked him to a little stream, but the opposite bank was trampled, and we lost all sign of him.\" This is what the boy said though his language is translated.\nNorris remained upon this encampment for a fortnight. Blue wildebeests, koodoos, elands, and gems-bok were plentiful, and once he got a shot at a wart-hog boar. At the end of the fortnight he walked round the ant-heap early one morning, and of a sudden plumped down full length in the grass. Straight in front of him he saw a herd of buffaloes moving in his direction down a glade of the forest a quarter of a mile away. Norris cast a glance backwards; the camp was hidden from the herd by the intervening ant-heap. He looked again towards the forest; the buffaloes advanced slowly, pasturing as they moved. Norris crawled behind the ant-heap on his hands and knees, ran thence into the camp, buckled on a belt of cartridges, snatched up a 450-bore Metford rifle, and got back to his position just as the first of the herd stepped into the open. It turned to the right along the edge of the wood, and the others followed in file. Norris wriggled forward through the grass, and selecting a fat bull in the centre of the line, aimed behind its shoulder and fired. The herd stampeded into the forest, the bull fell in its tracks.\nNorris sprang forward with a shout; but he had not run more than thirty yards before the bull began to kick. It kneeled upon its forelegs, rose thence on to its hind legs, and finally stood up. Norris guessed what had happened. He had hit the bull in the neck instead of behind the shoulders, and had broken no bones. He fired his second barrel as the brute streamed away in an oblique line southeastwards from the wood, and missed. Then he ran back to camp, slapped a bridle on to his swiftest horse, and without waiting to saddle it, sprang on its back and galloped in pursuit. He rode as it were along the base of a triangle, whereas the bull galloped from the apex, and since his breakfast was getting hot behind him, he wished to make that triangle an isosceles. So he jammed his heels into his horse's ribs, and was fast drawing within easy range, when the buffalo got his wind and swerved on the instant into a diagonal course due southwest.\nThe manoeuvre left Norris directly behind his quarry, and with a long, stern chase in prospect. However, his blood was up, and he held on to wear the beast down. He forgot his breakfast; he took no more than a casual notice of the direction he was following; he simply braced his knees in a closer grip, while the distorted shadows of himself and the horse lengthened and thinned along the ground as the sun rose over his right shoulder.\nSuddenly the buffalo disappeared in a dip of the veld, and a few moments later came again into view a good hundred yards further to the south. Norris pulled his left rein, and made for the exact spot at which the bull had reappeared. He found himself on the edge of a tiny cliff which dropped twenty feet in a sheer fall to a little stream, and he was compelled to ride along the bank until he reached the incline which the buffalo had descended. He forded the stream, galloped under the opposite bank across a patch of ground which had been trampled into mud by the hoofs of beasts coming here to water, and mounted again to the open. The bull had gained a quarter of a mile's grace from his mistake, and was heading straight for a huge cone of granite.\nNorris recognised the cone. It towered up from the veld, its cliffs seamed into gullies by the rain-wash of ages, and he had used it more than once as a landmark during the last fortnight, for it rose due southwest of his camp.\nHe watched the bull approach the cone and vanish into one of the gullies. It did not reappear, and he rode forward, keeping a close eye upon the gully. As he came opposite to it, however, he saw through the opening a vista of green trees flashing in the sunlight. He turned his horse through the passage, and reined up in a granite amphitheatre. The floor seemed about half a mile in diameter; it was broken into hillocks, and strewn with patches of a dense undergrowth, while here and there a big tree grew. The walls, which converged slightly towards an open top, were robed from summit to base with wild flowers, so that the whole circumference of the cone was one blaze of colour.\nNorris hitched forward and reloaded the rifle. Then he advanced slowly between the bushes on the alert for a charge from the wounded bull; but nothing stirred. No sound came to his ears except the soft padding noise of his horse's hoofs upon the turf. There was not a crackle of the brushwood, and the trees seemed carved out of metal.

      "prompt": "Continue summarizing Detective story 'How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg' by Unknown. This is part 3 of 4 segments. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-2):\nThe detective story \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg\" unfolds against the backdrop of early Johannesburg and the wild expanses of Southern Africa, intertwining themes of rivalry, survival, and the haunting past. The narrative centers on Norris, a man weary and disillusioned with the bustling Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the superficial trappings of urban life. In a candid conversation with friends in the Johannesburg marketplace, Norris confesses his profound dissatisfaction with the relentless ups and downs of the share market, the social distractions, and the city's frenetic pace. He predicts an impending economic slump and, rather than engaging further in the restless financial world, he resolves to seek refuge on the open veld—regions of undeveloped plains—hoping to live more cheaply and find peace.\n\nNorris’s plans attract the attention of Teddy Isaacs, a newcomer to Johannesburg unfamiliar with local tensions. When Isaacs mentions \"Barrington\" in passing, naming him as a man who disappeared from Mashonaland about a year prior, Norris and his friends react with marked irritation and unease. Barrington is not just any figure; to Norris and his circle, he embodies a deep-seated grievance and a personal conflict that weighs heavily. Norris’s calm but firm declaration that he intends to bring Barrington back if encountered conveys the seriousness of their unresolved history.\n\nThe story then steps back to reveal the origins of this fraught relationship between Norris and Barrington. Once ostrich farmers near Port Elizabeth in the Cape Colony, the two men were neighbors but sharply divided by a personal, scandalous dispute—details of which remain veiled to the curious Isaacs. Their falling out fractured a previously amicable or at least cordial acquaintance, and Barrington abruptly left the Cape Colony to seek fortune in the Transvaal at the dawn of Johannesburg’s rise. There, Barrington thrived amidst the chaos of early gold mining ventures, whereas Norris’s fortunes dwindled along with the ostrich industry. Norris, like many displaced by shifting economic tides, migrated to Johannesburg seeking new opportunities.\n\nThe climax of their rivalry unfolds dramatically on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange itself, where instead of a physical confrontation as feared, the two men engage in a metaphorical duel through financial maneuvers. Barrington’s superior skill overwhelms Norris, highlighting the disparity between them by likening Norris’s efforts to a derringer pistol against a machine gun. Despite Norris’s losses and eventual retreat, Barrington’s mysterious disappearance later opens a window for Norris to embark on his own journey into Manicaland, free from his financial entanglements.\n\nNorris prepares thoroughly for this expedition, acquiring a covered buck-wagon as shelter and transport, stocking ample provisions for six months, and recruiting a diverse team tailored to survive the African wilderness. He hires a Griqua boy to drive the wagon and a half dozen Matabele boys eager to return home. From Johannesburg, Norris heads to Makoni’s town near the storied ruins of Great Zimbabwe, acquiring a Ma-ongwi boy with local knowledge to guide him further into Mashonaland.\n\nThe chosen campsite lies in a grassy plain peppered with large granite boulders and scattered woodlands, near an ant-heap and a dense forest of machabel trees. This wild and isolated setting underscores the challenge Norris faces—entering a land that is both physically untamed and symbolically laden. The guide’s local insight lends Norris a measure of confidence amid the uncertainty.\n\nThe continuation of the story adds a profound layer of connection between Norris and Barrington’s enigmatic past. Norris inquires the Ma-ongwi boy about previous visits to the area, learning with surprise that the boy had been there twice—once three years ago and again just the previous year. Most startlingly, Barrington had been there last year. The boy confirms they have been following Barrington’s wagon-track, anchoring Barrington’s elusive presence to this very campsite.\n\nStirred by this revelation, Norris physically inspects the surroundings. He walks to a jasmine bush aligned with his camp fence’s opening, then traces a semicircle around the site until he discovers the wagon-track at the camp’s rear. This track abruptly stops here, with no indication of where Barrington might have gone north, east, or west. Norris realizes that the boy has deliberately chosen Barrington’s last known camping ground as theirs. There is an evocative irony in this choice, and Norris chuckles quietly at the thought that he is now \"standing in Barrington’s shoes.\" The implication is that Norris is confronting not only the wilderness but the literal and metaphorical footprints of his rival.\n\nThat night, as Norris smokes by the fire, he summons the Ma-ongwi boy from his hut behind the wagon, signaling the start of a deeper conversation that may uncover more about Barrington’s fate and the mysteries of the region. The scene suggests an anticipated alliance or at least a sharing of crucial knowledge that will drive the story forward.\n\nTogether, these segments establish a richly textured narrative blending personal rivalry and historical backdrop. Norris’s journey from urban disillusionment to the heart of Mashonaland reflects both an external adventure and an internal reckoning. The detailed setting—markets, mining towns, vast African plains, ancient ruins—and the varied cast of characters, including indigenous guides and settlers, situate the story at a dynamic intersection of colonial expansion, economic upheaval, and cultural encounter.\n\nMoreover, the motif of following tracks—both literal wagon trails and the figurative paths of past actions—symbolizes the detective element of the story. Norris is not merely traveling to a remote location; he is pursuing unresolved business, perhaps redemption or confrontation, tied intimately to Barrington’s disappearance and their shared history. The revelation that Barrington’s path ended here, and that Norris is deliberately occupying the same physical space, underscores the tension and inevitability of their intertwined fates.\n\nIn sum, the combined storyline up to this point portrays a man driven by disillusionment and a complex personal vendetta, transitioning from financial defeat to a frontier quest. Norris’s preparations and journey into the wild Mashonaland plateau position the narrative at the crossroads of justice, rivalry, and survival amid the shifting socio-political landscape of early 20th-century Southern Africa. The story promises to delve deeper into these themes as Norris engages more fully with the mysteries surrounding Barrington and the untamed land itself.\n\nCurrent segment (part 3):\n\"Tell me how you lost him,\" said Norris.\n\"He rode that way alone after a sable antelope.\" The boy pointed an arm to the southwest. \"The beast was wounded, and we followed its blood-spoor. We found Mr. Barrington's horse gored by the antelope's horns. He himself had gone forward on foot. We tracked him to a little stream, but the opposite bank was trampled, and we lost all sign of him.\" This is what the boy said though his language is translated.\nNorris remained upon this encampment for a fortnight. Blue wildebeests, koodoos, elands, and gems-bok were plentiful, and once he got a shot at a wart-hog boar. At the end of the fortnight he walked round the ant-heap early one morning, and of a sudden plumped down full length in the grass. Straight in front of him he saw a herd of buffaloes moving in his direction down a glade of the forest a quarter of a mile away. Norris cast a glance backwards; the camp was hidden from the herd by the intervening ant-heap. He looked again towards the forest; the buffaloes advanced slowly, pasturing as they moved. Norris crawled behind the ant-heap on his hands and knees, ran thence into the camp, buckled on a belt of cartridges, snatched up a 450-bore Metford rifle, and got back to his position just as the first of the herd stepped into the open. It turned to the right along the edge of the wood, and the others followed in file. Norris wriggled forward through the grass, and selecting a fat bull in the centre of the line, aimed behind its shoulder and fired. The herd stampeded into the forest, the bull fell in its tracks.\nNorris sprang forward with a shout; but he had not run more than thirty yards before the bull began to kick. It kneeled upon its forelegs, rose thence on to its hind legs, and finally stood up. Norris guessed what had happened. He had hit the bull in the neck instead of behind the shoulders, and had broken no bones. He fired his second barrel as the brute streamed away in an oblique line southeastwards from the wood, and missed. Then he ran back to camp, slapped a bridle on to his swiftest horse, and without waiting to saddle it, sprang on its back and galloped in pursuit. He rode as it were along the base of a triangle, whereas the bull galloped from the apex, and since his breakfast was getting hot behind him, he wished to make that triangle an isosceles. So he jammed his heels into his horse's ribs, and was fast drawing within easy range, when the buffalo got his wind and swerved on the instant into a diagonal course due southwest.\nThe manoeuvre left Norris directly behind his quarry, and with a long, stern chase in prospect. However, his blood was up, and he held on to wear the beast down. He forgot his breakfast; he took no more than a casual notice of the direction he was following; he simply braced his knees in a closer grip, while the distorted shadows of himself and the horse lengthened and thinned along the ground as the sun rose over his right shoulder.\nSuddenly the buffalo disappeared in a dip of the veld, and a few moments later came again into view a good hundred yards further to the south. Norris pulled his left rein, and made for the exact spot at which the bull had reappeared. He found himself on the edge of a tiny cliff which dropped twenty feet in a sheer fall to a little stream, and he was compelled to ride along the bank until he reached the incline which the buffalo had descended. He forded the stream, galloped under the opposite bank across a patch of ground which had been trampled into mud by the hoofs of beasts coming here to water, and mounted again to the open. The bull had gained a quarter of a mile's grace from his mistake, and was heading straight for a huge cone of granite.\nNorris recognised the cone. It towered up from the veld, its cliffs seamed into gullies by the rain-wash of ages, and he had used it more than once as a landmark during the last fortnight, for it rose due southwest of his camp.\nHe watched the bull approach the cone and vanish into one of the gullies. It did not reappear, and he rode forward, keeping a close eye upon the gully. As he came opposite to it, however, he saw through the opening a vista of green trees flashing in the sunlight. He turned his horse through the passage, and reined up in a granite amphitheatre. The floor seemed about half a mile in diameter; it was broken into hillocks, and strewn with patches of a dense undergrowth, while here and there a big tree grew. The walls, which converged slightly towards an open top, were robed from summit to base with wild flowers, so that the whole circumference of the cone was one blaze of colour.\nNorris hitched forward and reloaded the rifle. Then he advanced slowly between the bushes on the alert for a charge from the wounded bull; but nothing stirred. No sound came to his ears except the soft padding noise of his horse's hoofs upon the turf. There was not a crackle of the brushwood, and the trees seemed carved out of metal. He rode through absolute silence in a suspension of all movement. Once his horse trod upon a bough, and the snapping of the twigs sounded like so many cracks of a pistol. At first the silence struck Norris as merely curious, a little later as very lonesome. Once or twice he stopped his horse with a sudden jerk of the reins, and sat crouched forwards with his neck outstretched, listening. Once or twice he cast a quick, furtive glance over his shoulder to make certain that no one stood between himself and the entrance to the hollow. He forgot the buffalo; he caught himself labouring his breath, and found it necessary to elaborately explain the circumstance in his thoughts on the ground of heat.\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

In a candid discussion within the bustling Johannesburg marketplace, Norris expresses his deep dissatisfaction with the incessant fluctuations of the share market and the city’s relentless pace. Predicting an imminent economic downturn, he resolves to abandon the frenetic financial world in favor of the open veld, hoping to find peace and live more frugally in the untamed expanses of Southern Africa.\n\nNorris’s decision intrigues Teddy Isaacs, a newcomer unfamiliar with the local dynamics who inadvertently sparks tension by mentioning \"Barrington,\" a man who vanished mysteriously from Mashonaland about a year earlier. Norris and his associates react with notable unease and irritation at the mention of Barrington, hinting at a fraught and unresolved history between the two men. When Norris asserts his intent to bring Barrington back should he find him, it becomes clear that their rivalry is deeply personal and serious.\n\nThe story then revisits the origins of this animosity. Norris and Barrington were once ostrich farmers near Port Elizabeth, Cape Colony, but a bitter personal dispute drove them apart. While Barrington left for Johannesburg at the onset of the gold rush and found success amid the chaotic mining boom, Norris’s fortunes declined alongside the ostrich industry, compelling him to seek opportunities in Johannesburg’s burgeoning urban environment. Their rivalry reached a symbolic peak at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, where Barrington’s financial acumen crushed Norris’s efforts—a metaphorical duel likened to a derringer pistol facing a machine gun. Despite his defeat and Barrington’s subsequent disappearance, Norris’s quest brings him to Manicaland, setting the stage for deeper exploration in the wilderness where Barrington was last seen.\n\nPreparing for his journey, Norris equips himself with a covered buck-wagon stocked for six months, and assembles a team including a Griqua boy as driver and several Matabele boys to return home, evidencing his commitment to this venture into the wild. They journey from Johannesburg to Makoni’s town near the legendary ruins of Great Zimbabwe, recruiting a Ma-ongwi boy with intimate local knowledge to guide them further into Mashonaland. Their chosen campsite lies in a grassy plain dotted with granite boulders and thick machabel trees, a site rich with natural features including ant-heaps and forest clearings. This untamed, isolated setting underscores the formidable challenge Norris faces as he not only explores the unknown land but symbolically confronts the past embodied by Barrington.\n\nThe Ma-ongwi guide confirms they have been tracking Barrington’s wagon tracks, revealing that Barrington was in the area just the previous year. This revelation emotionally anchors Norris to the mysterious figure he pursues; he reflects with a wry chuckle that he is now \"standing in Barrington’s shoes,\" deepening the symbolic tension between them. Norris’s camping near the exact place Barrington vanished transforms the expedition into a literal and figurative hunt. That evening, a quiet yet significant dialogue begins between Norris and the Ma-ongwi boy, aimed at uncovering more about Barrington’s fate and the mysteries of the land itself.\n\nIn the continuation of his stay, Norris spends two weeks on the encampment, encountering abundant African wildlife including wildebeests, koodoos, elands, gems-bok, and even attempting to hunt a wart-hog boar. His immersion in the natural environment highlights his adaptation from an urban dweller to a frontier man.\n\nA pivotal episode unfolds early one morning when Norris, out walking near an ant-heap by his camp, spots a herd of buffalo advancing quietly through a forest glade toward him. Quickly maneuvering to avoid detection, Norris grabs his rifle and takes aim at a fat bull among the herd. He fires but mistakenly hits the bull’s neck instead of behind the shoulder, incapacitating but not killing it. The buffalo initially falls but then rises and flees. Norris fires again and misses, then swiftly mounts his horse and chases after the wounded bull.\n\nWhat follows is a tense chase, with Norris riding hard across the veld, trying to outpace and wear down the buffalo. His pursuit leads him to a dramatic natural feature—a massive granite cone rising from the plains, its sheer cliffs carved by rain and adorned with wildflowers. The buffalo disappears into one of the gullies on the cone’s face, prompting Norris to follow cautiously.\n\nEntering the granite amphitheater, Norris is enveloped in a surreal, almost uncanny silence. The floor of the amphitheater is a mix of hillocks, undergrowth, and scattered trees, encircled by cliffs blanketed with flowers. The silence is so profound that every small sound, like the snap of a twig under his horse’s hoof, echoes sharply in the stillness. Norris becomes alert and tense, stopping repeatedly to listen for any sign of danger, sensing the strangeness and solitude of the place deep in the wilderness.\n\nIn this moment, Norris’s focus shifts away from the wounded buffalo to the eerie, profound quiet and isolation of the gorge-like hollow. The atmosphere here is almost otherworldly, heightening both his awareness and unease, and marking a point in the journey where the external wilderness underscores the internal tension and mystery surrounding Barrington’s disappearance.\n\nOverall, this part of the narrative deepens the story’s themes of pursuit and confrontation—between man and nature, past and present, rival and hunter. Norris’s hunting expedition is not purely about game but mirrors his hunt for truth and resolution with Barrington. The silent granite amphitheater becomes a symbolic space where the story’s underlying mysteries converge, and Norris’s readiness to face whatever lies hidden advances the mystery at the heart of the tale.\n\nIn summary, \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg\" evolves into a richly layered story blending personal vendetta with an immersive natural setting and an enigmatic disappearance. Norris’s transformation from a defeated city investor to a rugged frontier adventurer captures the spirit of colonial-era Southern Africa, while his interaction with indigenous guides and the wild landscape underscores the complex intersections of cultures, survival, and justice. The continuous motif of following tracks—both in the natural world and through human histories—propels the detective element forward, as Norris moves physically and emotionally into the shadows left by Barrington’s enigmatic past. As the story progresses, Norris finds himself not only tracking a man but stepping into a place where nature’s silence and the ghosts of history meet, setting the stage for the dramatic resolution to come."

      "chunk_text": "The next moment he began to plead this heat not merely as an excuse for his uneasiness, but as a reason for returning to camp. The heat was intense, he argued. Above him the light of an African midday sun poured out of a brassy sky into a sort of inverted funnel, and lay in blinding pools upon the scattered slabs of rock. Within the hollow, every cup of the innumerable flowers which tapestried the cliffs seemed a mouth breathing heat. He became possessed with a parching thirst, and he felt his tongue heavy and fibrous like a dried fig. There was, however, one obstacle which prevented him from acting upon his impulse, and that obstacle was his sense of shame. It was not so much that he thought it cowardly to give up the chase and quietly return, but he knew that the second after he had given way, he would be galloping madly towards the entrance in no child's panic of terror. He finally compromised matters by dropping the reins upon his horse's neck in the unformulated hope that the animal would turn of its own accord; but the horse kept straight on.\nAs Norris drew towards the innermost wall of granite, there was a quick rustle all across its face as though the screen of shrubs and flowers had been fluttered by a draught of wind. Norris drew himself erect with a distinct appearance of relief, loosened the clench of his fingers upon his rifle, and began once more to search the bushes for the buffalo.\nFor a moment his attention was arrested by a queer object lying upon the ground to his left. It was in shape something like a melon, but bigger, and it seemed to be plastered over with a black mould. Norris rode by it, turned a corner, and then with a gasp reined back his horse upon its haunches. Straight in front of him a broken rifle lay across the path.\nNorris stood still, and stared at it stupidly. Some vague recollection floated elusively through his brain. He tried to grasp and fix it clearly in his mind. It was a recollection of something which had happened a long while ago, in England, when he was at school. Suddenly, he remembered. It was not something which had happened, but something he had read under the great elm trees in the close. It was that passage in Robinson Crusoe which tells of the naked footprint in the sand.\nNorris dismounted, and stooped to lift the rifle; but all at once he straightened himself, and swung round with his arms guarding his head. There was no one, however, behind him, and he gave a little quavering laugh, and picked up the rifle. It was a heavy lo-bore Holland, a Holland with a single barrel, and that barrel was twisted like a corkscrew. The lock had been wrenched off, and there were marks upon the stock—marks of teeth, and other queer, unintelligible marks as well.\nNorris held the rifle in his hands, gazing vacantly straight ahead. He was thinking of the direction in which he had come, southwest, and of the stream which he had crossed, and of the patch of trampled mud, where track obliterated track. He dropped the rifle. It rang upon a stone, and again the screen of foliage shivered and rustled. Norris, however, paid no attention to the movement, but ran back to that object which he had passed, and took it in his hands.\nIt was oval in shape, being slightly broader at one end than the other. Norris drew his knife and cleaned the mould from one side of it. To the touch of the blade it seemed softer than stone, and smoother than wood. \"More like bone,\" he said to himself. In the side which he had cleaned, there was a little round hole filled up with mould. Norris dug his knife in and scraped round the hole as one cleans a caked pipe. He drew out a little cube of mud. There was a second corresponding hole on the other side. He turned the narrower end of the thing upwards. It was hollow, he saw, but packed full of mould, and more deliberately packed, for there were finger-marks in the mould. \"What an aimless trick!\" he muttered vaguely.\nHe carried the thing back to the rifle, and, comparing them, understood those queer marks upon the stock. They were the mark of fingers, of human fingers, impressed faintly upon the wood with superhuman strength. He was holding the rifle in his hands and looking down at it; but he saw below the rifle, and he saw that his knees were shaking in a palsy.\nOn an instant he tossed the rifle away, and laughed to reassure himself—laughed out boldly, once, twice; and then he stopped with his eyes riveted upon the granite wall. At each laugh that he gave the shrubs and flowers rippled, and shook the sunlight from their leaves. For the first time he remarked the coincidence as something strange. He lifted up his face, but not a breath of air fanned it; he looked across the hollow, the trees and bushes stood immobile. He laughed a third time, louder than before, and all at once his laughter got hold of him; he sent it pealing out hysterically, burst after burst, until the hollow seemed brimming with the din of it. His body began to twist; he beat time to his laughter with his feet, and then he danced. He danced there alone in the African sunlight faster and faster, with a mad tossing of his limbs, and with his laughter grown to a yell. And as though to keep pace with him, each moment the shiver of the foliage increased. Up and down, crosswise and breadthwise, the flowers were tossed and flung, while their petals rained down the cliff's face in a purple storm. It appeared, indeed, to Norris that the very granite walls were moving.\nIn the midst of his dance he kicked something and stumbled. He stopped dead when he saw what that something was. It was the queer, mud-plastered object which he had compared with the broken rifle, and the sight of it recalled him to his wits. He tucked it hastily beneath his jacket, and looked about him for his horse. The horse was standing behind him some distance away, and nearer to the cliff. Norris snatched up his own rifle, and ran towards it. His hand was on the horse's mane, when just above its head he noticed a clean patch of granite, and across that space he saw a huge grey baboon leap, and then another, and another.",

It was hollow, he saw, but packed full of mould, and more deliberately packed, for there were finger-marks in the mould. \"What an aimless trick!\" he muttered vaguely.\nHe carried the thing back to the rifle, and, comparing them, understood those queer marks upon the stock. They were the mark of fingers, of human fingers, impressed faintly upon the wood with superhuman strength. He was holding the rifle in his hands and looking down at it; but he saw below the rifle, and he saw that his knees were shaking in a palsy.\nOn an instant he tossed the rifle away, and laughed to reassure himself—laughed out boldly, once, twice; and then he stopped with his eyes riveted upon the granite wall. At each laugh that he gave the shrubs and flowers rippled, and shook the sunlight from their leaves. For the first time he remarked the coincidence as something strange. He lifted up his face, but not a breath of air fanned it; he looked across the hollow, the trees and bushes stood immobile. He laughed a third time, louder than before, and all at once his laughter got hold of him; he sent it pealing out hysterically, burst after burst, until the hollow seemed brimming with the din of it. His body began to twist; he beat time to his laughter with his feet, and then he danced. He danced there alone in the African sunlight faster and faster, with a mad tossing of his limbs, and with his laughter grown to a yell. And as though to keep pace with him, each moment the shiver of the foliage increased. Up and down, crosswise and breadthwise, the flowers were tossed and flung, while their petals rained down the cliff's face in a purple storm. It appeared, indeed, to Norris that the very granite walls were moving.\nIn the midst of his dance he kicked something and stumbled. He stopped dead when he saw what that something was. It was the queer, mud-plastered object which he had compared with the broken rifle, and the sight of it recalled him to his wits. He tucked it hastily beneath his jacket, and looked about him for his horse. The horse was standing behind him some distance away, and nearer to the cliff. Norris snatched up his own rifle, and ran towards it. His hand was on the horse's mane, when just above its head he noticed a clean patch of granite, and across that space he saw a huge grey baboon leap, and then another, and another.\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "The detective story \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg\" is set in the raw and wild expanses of early Johannesburg and Southern Africa, blending themes of rivalry, survival, and mystery into a richly atmospheric narrative. Through the journey and inner transformation of Norris, the tale captures the tensions between urban and frontier life, personal vendettas, and the enigmatic wilderness.\n\nAt the story’s outset, Norris is portrayed as a man disenchanted with the ruthless, fluctuating world of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The city's superficiality and relentless pace leave him weary. During a lively marketplace conversation, he voices his dissatisfaction with the share market’s volatility and predicts an impending crash. Seeking escape and simplicity, Norris resolves to abandon the city for the untamed African veld, hoping to find peace and meaning far from financial speculation and urban hustle.\n\nThis decision piques the curiosity of Teddy Isaacs, a newcomer unaware of the local intricacies, who inadvertently mentions “Barrington”—a man who vanished mysteriously in Mashonaland about a year earlier. Norris and those around him react with sudden unease and irritation upon hearing Barrington’s name, hinting at a complex and bitter history. Norris’s determination that, if possible, he would find and bring Barrington back reveals the personal intensity of their rivalry.\n\nThe narrative then recounts the rivalry’s origins: both men were ostrich farmers near Port Elizabeth, Cape Colony, until a bitter quarrel separated them. Barrington had left for Johannesburg at the dawn of the gold rush, achieving success amid the chaotic mining boom, while Norris’s fortunes waned alongside the ostrich industry, compelling him to follow opportunities in Johannesburg. Their rivalry culminated at the Stock Exchange, where Barrington’s superior financial skill decisively defeated Norris, a clash metaphorically portrayed as a derringer battling a machine gun. Despite Barrington’s subsequent disappearance, Norris embarks on a journey into Manicaland to learn more.\n\nEquipped for a prolonged expedition, Norris outfits a covered buck-wagon with six months' supplies and assembles a team, including a Griqua driver and Matabele boys, to travel from Johannesburg to Makoni’s town, near the legendary Great Zimbabwe ruins. There, they recruit a Ma-ongwi boy familiar with the territory to guide them deeper into Mashonaland. Eventually, they camp on a grassy plain amidst granite boulders and dense machabel trees, a place teeming with natural features like ant-heaps and forest glades, embodying both the physical and symbolic wilderness Norris must confront.\n\nThe Ma-ongwi guide confirms they’ve been following Barrington’s wagon tracks, proving Barrington had recently been in the area, which stirs in Norris a mixture of emotions. He remarks wryly that he is literally “standing in Barrington’s shoes,” adding a spectral dimension to his pursuit. The camp marks the very spot where Barrington vanished, transforming Norris’s journey into a literal and figurative quest—tracking not just a man but an elusive past.\n\nDuring a prolonged stay, Norris becomes immersed in the natural environment, encountering a wealth of African wildlife, from wildebeests and elands to the elusive gemsbok. His attempts to hunt, including a tense buffalo chase, mark his transformation from a city man to a rugged frontiersman. The hunting sequences serve as metaphors for his psychological and emotional pursuit of Barrington—a blur between man and nature, hunter and hunted.\n\nOne morning, Norris spots a herd of buffalo quietly advancing near his camp. Seizing a chance, he fires at a large bull but wounds rather than kills it, prompting a tense chase across the veld on horseback. The pursuit leads him to a startling geological formation—a massive granite cone rising sharply from the plains, its cliffs adorned with wildflowers and carved gullies. The serenity inside this natural amphitheater is eerie, amplifying Norris’s tension and sense of isolation. The silence is so profound that ordinary noises echo ominously, making the place feel almost supernatural.\n\nIn the fourth and final segment of the story, Norris’s increasingly fraught emotions are laid bare as he grapples with the oppressive midday heat in the granite hollow. The African sun beats down relentlessly, the rays channeled like molten light through the inverted funnel of the amphitheater. Every flower and leaf seems to breathe the scorching heat, intensifying Norris’s thirst and physical discomfort. Yet this heat — though an aggravating factor — also feeds his anxiety and unease, a sensation he cannot easily dismiss. Though tempted to abandon the chase and return to camp, his pride and fear of betraying cowardice restrain him; he fears that once he breaks, he will flee in terror.\n\nHe attempts to let his horse decide the way by dropping reins, hoping the animal will turn of its own accord, but the horse presses onward. As he nears the granite wall at the amphitheater’s innermost face, a sudden rustling sweeps over the bush and flowers on the cliff face, reminiscent of a mysterious breeze—though no wind stirs. Norris relaxes somewhat, loosening his tight grip on his rifle, and resumes searching the underbrush for the buffalo.\n\nAmidst this tense moment, he notices an odd, melon-shaped blackened object lying on the ground, covered in mold. Riding past it, he soon reconsiders and returns to investigate a broken rifle lying across the path. The rifle is a heavy lo-bore Holland with a twisted barrel, its lock torn off and the stock marked with strange, jagged tooth impressions and other baffling indentations. This sight immediately unsettles Norris, triggering a vague, elusive reminder of a story he once read—in his school days back in England—of a naked footprint in the sand, a passage from \"Robinson Crusoe.\" This association connects to the sense of mysterious human traces left behind in the wilderness.\n\nNorris dismounts cautiously but senses an unseen presence, turning defensively, only to find himself alone. He picks up the damaged rifle, his mind swirling with uncertainty. The rifle feels heavy and threatening in his hands; as he contemplates the finger-like imprints on the wood, his knees begin to shake uncontrollably. Overwhelmed, he casts the rifle aside and laughs nervously to himself, a laughter escalating into hysteria. The surrounding vegetation seems to respond—the shrubs and flowers ripple and shake with his laughter, petals fluttering down the granite cliff like a purple storm. The stillness and heat imbue the landscape with a living, almost supernatural energy, as if the stones themselves pulse with life.\n\nNorris’s emotional turmoil culminates in a wild, frantic dance, accompanied by bursts of raucous laughter, his limbs flailing in tandem with the agitation of the flora around him. The perception that the very granite cliffs are moving adds to the uncanny atmosphere, signaling his fracturing state of mind or an overwhelming confrontation with forces beyond human comprehension.\n\nSuddenly, he stumbles over the very odd, mold-covered object he had earlier examined. Recovery to his senses draws him swiftly to conceal this artifact—now clearly significant—beneath his jacket before searching for his horse. When he finds it near the cliffs, Norris spots a startling sight: a troop of huge grey baboons leap across a clear granite patch above the horse. The appearance of these formidable primates, combined with the eerie environment and the strange relic in his possession, intensifies the story’s atmosphere of mystery and encroaching danger.\n\nTaken as a whole, \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg\" is more than a tale of a simple pursuit; it is a layered exploration of rivalry, the clash between civilization and wilderness, and the enigmatic traces humans leave amid the vast African landscape. Norris’s evolving journey from a disillusioned city trader to an immersed wilderness seeker mirrors the broader historical and cultural shifts of the colonial frontier. The complex interplay of natural hazards, encounters with indigenous peoples, and mysterious artifacts heightens the detective element, merging the hunt for a vanished man with an existential confrontation with the unknown.\n\nIn the climax at the granite amphitheater, the story achieves a surreal intensity—the heat, the shifting shadows, the broken rifle with its strange marks, and the strange artifact in mold all function as symbols of hidden histories and unresolved tensions. Norris’s hysteria and wild dance echo the primal energy of the land itself, blurring the lines between man and environment, sanity and madness, past and present. The sudden presence of baboons further grounds the scene in wildness and unpredictability, emphasizing the precariousness of human intrusion into this primeval domain.\n\nUltimately, the story leaves readers contemplating the meaning of tracks—whether wagon tracks in the dust or traces etched on weathered wood—signaling how the mysteries of human conflict and nature intertwine. Norris, in tracking Barrington, steps not only into a remote place but also into a liminal space charged with psychological and historical resonance where the silence of the land meets the echoes of personal vendettas and secrets. \"How Barrington Returned to Johannesburg\" thus stands as a haunting narrative of pursuit and discovery set against the vast, untamed backdrop of Southern Africa’s early colonial era."
