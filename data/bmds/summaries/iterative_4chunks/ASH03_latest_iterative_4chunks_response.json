      "chunk_text": "“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.”\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.”\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand your thinking so.” I said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A husband's cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.”\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.”\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.”\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.”\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked with interest.\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.”\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?”\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters are without looking.” Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?”\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?”\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.”\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.”\n“Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.”\n“And your mother is alive?”\n“Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got £4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.”\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\n“Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.”\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £60.”\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.”",

      "summary": "In the opening segment of the detective story \"A Case of Identity,\" the scene is set in the familiar surroundings of Sherlock Holmes’s lodgings at Baker Street, where Holmes and Dr. Watson are engaged in a reflective conversation by the fireside. Holmes muses on the extraordinary nature of real life, noting that it often surpasses the wildest inventions of the human mind in strangeness and complexity. He paints a vivid picture of the chaotic and intertwined events unfolding beneath the roofs of London, replete with strange coincidences, secret plans, and complex chains of cause and effect that defy even the most elaborate works of fiction. Holmes’s view is that reality is far more unpredictable and nuanced than reported detective stories or police cases typically suggest.\n\nWatson expresses skepticism about Holmes’s viewpoint, suggesting that the cases documented in newspapers are generally dull and uninspiring, reflecting brutal and mundane realities such as domestic abuse or criminal folly, which lack the artistic intrigue and fascination of fictional mysteries. Holmes counters this by criticizing the way police reports emphasize formulaic and banal judicial observations rather than the subtle, revealing details of human behavior and motivations that truly enrich the understanding of any case. He insists that true strangeness is often concealed beneath commonplace occurrences, which appear unnatural precisely because they are so ordinary.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Watson picks up the morning newspaper and reads a headline concerning cruelty in a marriage, citing the stereotypical elements often seen in such stories: infidelity, alcohol, violence, and sympathy from neighbors. Holmes corrects Watson’s assumptions, revealing that he was directly involved in the actual case mentioned—the Dundas separation case—and that its facts were far from typical or clichéd. For example, the husband in question was a teetotaler with no romantic entanglements, and his cruel behavior involved the bizarre habit of throwing his false teeth at his wife after meals—a detail unlikely to be imagined by an average writer. Holmes wins the small contest with Watson, delighting in the subtlety and unexpectedness of real-life mysteries.\n\nHolmes’s refined taste for intrigue is underscored by the mention of the valuable gifts he has received from various European royal personages: an ornate snuffbox from the King of Bohemia and a brilliant ring from the Dutch royal family. These tokens hint at Holmes’s far-reaching reputation and the delicate nature of his investigations, though he cryptically declines to discuss the details behind the latter gift.\n\nWhen Watson inquires about his current cases, Holmes reveals that he is handling a dozen or so matters, though none are particularly captivating. He reflects that often the more significant crimes tend to have clearer motives and simpler explanations; it is usually the smaller, seemingly trivial cases that offer the richest opportunity for the intellectual engagement that he values most. As they speak, Holmes’s attention is drawn to a woman waiting nervously outside their window on the opposite pavement. She is described as large, with a heavy fur boa and a flamboyant hat trimmed with a red feather, and her jittery behavior betrays emotional distress.\n\nHolmes interprets her visible hesitation and repeated pacing in front of the building as indicative of a romantic dilemma—not one of outright betrayal or anger, but rather confusion or sorrow regarding a delicate personal matter. Within moments, the woman gathers her courage, crosses the street, and formally announces herself at Holmes’s lodgings by ringing the bell.\n\nThe visitor is soon revealed as Miss Mary Sutherland, who is introduced with a respectful formality by the office boy. Holmes welcomes her with his characteristic courteous warmth and immediately observes her appearance and demeanor with detached yet acute interest. He inquires about her sight, noting an apparent challenge with her typewriting work, to which she replies that she has adapted to it skillfully. Startled by his perception of her condition, Mary is taken aback and questions how Holmes knows such details, to which he replies with humble amusement that knowledge of such subtleties is part of his profession.\n\nMary explains that she has come to Holmes on the recommendation of Mrs. Etherege, whose husband was previously helped by Holmes in a difficult situation that had stumped even the police. She confesses her eagerness and desperation for Holmes’s assistance regarding the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Hosmer Angel, a man to whom she was betrothed or closely connected, and whose current whereabouts or fate is unknown. Mary reveals that she is financially independent to some extent, possessing an income of about £100 a year derived from New Zealand stock left to her by an uncle, which she supplements with earnings from her work as a typist. Although modest, she manages to live without being a burden to her family and was frustrated by the indifferent attitude of her stepfather, Mr. Windibank, who neither involved the police nor sought Holmes’s help.\n\nHolmes probes into Mary’s family background and living situation. She explains that her mother remarried soon after her biological father’s death, to a man significantly younger than herself. The family once owned a plumbing business inherited from Mary’s father, but her stepfather pressed her mother to sell it, arguing superiority as a wine traveller. The sale price was £4,700, which Mary believes was less than could have been realized had her father lived. Holmes finds these details about her income source and living arrangements particularly interesting, as they provide context for her social and financial position.\n\nMary candidly describes her modest but independent lifestyle: she earns through typewriting at two pence per sheet, often completing 15 to 20 sheets a day, which complements her investment income. Holmes acknowledges the clarity of her situation and formally introduces her to Watson, encouraging her to fully disclose all she knows about her relationship with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\n\nThis segment sets the stage for a classic Holmes investigation, introducing the primary client, the mysterious circumstances of Mr. Hosmer Angel’s disappearance, and presenting the various social and familial dynamics that may complicate the case. Holmes’s analytical demeanor, his appreciation for the subtle complexities of human nature, and his uncanny ability to read facts from small details are prominently featured, establishing the mood for a tale of mystery and deduction. Mary Sutherland’s arrival, her financial independence, her family’s somewhat complicated structure, and her puzzlement over Mr. Hosmer Angel’s fate form the narrative foundation upon which the ensuing investigation will be built."

      "chunk_text": "A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters' ball,” she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.”\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\n“No?”\n“Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street—and—”\n“What office?”\n“That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know.”\n“Where did he live, then?”\n“He slept on the premises.”\n“And you don't know his address?”\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.”\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?”\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\n“It missed him, then?”\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”",

Holmes’s view is that reality is far more unpredictable and nuanced than reported detective stories or police cases typically suggest.\n\nWatson expresses skepticism about Holmes’s viewpoint, suggesting that the cases documented in newspapers are generally dull and uninspiring, reflecting brutal and mundane realities such as domestic abuse or criminal folly, which lack the artistic intrigue and fascination of fictional mysteries. Holmes counters this by criticizing the way police reports emphasize formulaic and banal judicial observations rather than the subtle, revealing details of human behavior and motivations that truly enrich the understanding of any case. He insists that true strangeness is often concealed beneath commonplace occurrences, which appear unnatural precisely because they are so ordinary.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Watson picks up the morning newspaper and reads a headline concerning cruelty in a marriage, citing the stereotypical elements often seen in such stories: infidelity, alcohol, violence, and sympathy from neighbors. Holmes corrects Watson’s assumptions, revealing that he was directly involved in the actual case mentioned—the Dundas separation case—and that its facts were far from typical or clichéd. For example, the husband in question was a teetotaler with no romantic entanglements, and his cruel behavior involved the bizarre habit of throwing his false teeth at his wife after meals—a detail unlikely to be imagined by an average writer. Holmes wins the small contest with Watson, delighting in the subtlety and unexpectedness of real-life mysteries.\n\nHolmes’s refined taste for intrigue is underscored by the mention of the valuable gifts he has received from various European royal personages: an ornate snuffbox from the King of Bohemia and a brilliant ring from the Dutch royal family. These tokens hint at Holmes’s far-reaching reputation and the delicate nature of his investigations, though he cryptically declines to discuss the details behind the latter gift.\n\nWhen Watson inquires about his current cases, Holmes reveals that he is handling a dozen or so matters, though none are particularly captivating. He reflects that often the more significant crimes tend to have clearer motives and simpler explanations; it is usually the smaller, seemingly trivial cases that offer the richest opportunity for the intellectual engagement that he values most. As they speak, Holmes’s attention is drawn to a woman waiting nervously outside their window on the opposite pavement. She is described as large, with a heavy fur boa and a flamboyant hat trimmed with a red feather, and her jittery behavior betrays emotional distress.\n\nHolmes interprets her visible hesitation and repeated pacing in front of the building as indicative of a romantic dilemma—not one of outright betrayal or anger, but rather confusion or sorrow regarding a delicate personal matter. Within moments, the woman gathers her courage, crosses the street, and formally announces herself at Holmes’s lodgings by ringing the bell.\n\nThe visitor is soon revealed as Miss Mary Sutherland, who is introduced with a respectful formality by the office boy. Holmes welcomes her with his characteristic courteous warmth and immediately observes her appearance and demeanor with detached yet acute interest. He inquires about her sight, noting an apparent challenge with her typewriting work, to which she replies that she has adapted to it skillfully. Startled by his perception of her condition, Mary is taken aback and questions how Holmes knows such details, to which he replies with humble amusement that knowledge of such subtleties is part of his profession.\n\nMary explains that she has come to Holmes on the recommendation of Mrs. Etherege, whose husband was previously helped by Holmes in a difficult situation that had stumped even the police. She confesses her eagerness and desperation for Holmes’s assistance regarding the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Hosmer Angel, a man to whom she was betrothed or closely connected, and whose current whereabouts or fate is unknown. Mary reveals that she is financially independent to some extent, possessing an income of about £100 a year derived from New Zealand stock left to her by an uncle, which she supplements with earnings from her work as a typist. Although modest, she manages to live without being a burden to her family and was frustrated by the indifferent attitude of her stepfather, Mr. Windibank, who neither involved the police nor sought Holmes’s help.\n\nHolmes probes into Mary’s family background and living situation. She explains that her mother remarried soon after her biological father’s death, to a man significantly younger than herself. The family once owned a plumbing business inherited from Mary’s father, but her stepfather pressed her mother to sell it, arguing superiority as a wine traveller. The sale price was £4,700, which Mary believes was less than could have been realized had her father lived. Holmes finds these details about her income source and living arrangements particularly interesting, as they provide context for her social and financial position.\n\nMary candidly describes her modest but independent lifestyle: she earns through typewriting at two pence per sheet, often completing 15 to 20 sheets a day, which complements her investment income. Holmes acknowledges the clarity of her situation and formally introduces her to Watson, encouraging her to fully disclose all she knows about her relationship with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\n\nThis segment sets the stage for a classic Holmes investigation, introducing the primary client, the mysterious circumstances of Mr. Hosmer Angel’s disappearance, and presenting the various social and familial dynamics that may complicate the case. Holmes’s analytical demeanor, his appreciation for the subtle complexities of human nature, and his uncanny ability to read facts from small details are prominently featured, establishing the mood for a tale of mystery and deduction. Mary Sutherland’s arrival, her financial independence, her family’s somewhat complicated structure, and her puzzlement over Mr. Hosmer Angel’s fate form the narrative foundation upon which the ensuing investigation will be built.\n\nCurrent segment (part 2):\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters' ball,” she said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.”\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\n“No?”\n“Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.”\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.”\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\n“Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street—and—”\n“What office?”\n“That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know.”\n“Where did he live, then?”\n“He slept on the premises.”\n“And you don't know his address?”\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.”\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.”\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?”\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.”\n“It missed him, then?”\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?”\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said Holmes.\n“Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "In the first part of \"A Case of Identity,\" the story opens with the iconic pairing of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson at their Baker Street lodgings, engaging in a thoughtful dialogue about the nature of reality and the peculiarities of true-life mysteries. Holmes opines that reality is far stranger and more intricate than fiction, often displaying an unexpected subtlety that routine police reports and newspapers fail to capture. Through a playful exchange, Holmes illustrates this by describing a recent case he handled involving the strange habit of a husband throwing his false teeth at his wife—an odd detail unlikely to arise in conventional fiction. This initial discussion establishes Holmes’s keen eye for hidden human behaviors and his distaste for simplistic explanations, setting the tone for an intellectually stimulating detective narrative.\n\nThe tranquility of their evening is soon interrupted by the arrival of a troubled visitor, Miss Mary Sutherland, ushered in by an office boy and presented with Holmes’s customary courtesy. Mary is visibly anxious and somewhat apprehensive but explains that she has sought Holmes’s assistance on the advice of Mrs. Etherege, whose husband had benefited from Holmes’s expertise. Mary’s predicament involves the mysterious disappearance of her fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel, whose sudden vanishing has left her perplexed and emotionally distressed. Financially independent to a modest degree, Mary supports herself through a combination of a modest inheritance from New Zealand stock and her work as a typist. Her family situation is complicated by the presence of a younger stepfather, Mr. Windibank, whose domineering and dismissive attitude has hindered any meaningful intervention from the police or other authorities.\n\nAs Mary recounts her circumstances, she reveals that her late father was a plumber who once ran a successful plumbing business. After his death, her mother remarried Windibank, a wine traveler, who persuaded her to sell the plumbing business, allegedly for less than its worth—a decision that seems to have contributed to the family's diminished circumstances. Throughout these details, Holmes listens with acute interest, showing his ability to glean insight from the social and economic context surrounding a case. With these foundational facts laid out, Holmes encourages Mary to share everything she knows about Mr. Hosmer Angel and their relationship, preparing to unravel the mystery piece by piece.\n\nThe second segment delves deeply into Mary’s narrative concerning how she met Mr. Hosmer Angel. The story begins at the gasfitters' ball, an event originally associated with her late father’s profession and later attended by her and her mother despite her stepfather’s objections. Windibank was hostile to such social engagements, discouraging Mary from mingling or even joining benign outings like Sunday-school treats, using excuses ranging from social unfitness to disapproval of her attire. Nevertheless, Mary, determined not to be constrained, persuaded her mother to attend the ball with Mr. Hardy, the family’s former foreman, during one of Windibank’s business trips to France.\n\nIt was at this ball that Mary first met Mr. Hosmer Angel, a shy, retiring, and gentlemanly man who left a strong impression on her. He was described as well-dressed but plain, with weak eyes protected by tinted glasses and a gentle voice hindered by lingering effects of a childhood illness. She recalls that he preferred evening walks to avoid attention and was attentive in small, affectionate ways—for instance, preferring her handwritten letters to be unmechanized because the typewriting seemed impersonal. These little details—the kind of subtle behaviors Holmes values—aid in building an understanding of Angel’s character.\n\nAfter their initial meeting, Mr. Hosmer Angel began visiting Mary at her home, but these visits ceased when her stepfather returned from France, given Windibank’s forbidding nature. Despite the social barrier, the two maintained contact through daily correspondence, using a Post Office box in Leadenhall Street to receive letters discreetly. Interestingly, Mary did not know the specific address of Angel’s workplace or residence, only that he worked as a cashier somewhere in Leadenhall Street and slept 'on the premises.'\n\nThe relationship quickly deepened, culminating in an engagement shortly after their first walk. Mary and her mother both admired Hosmer Angel; her mother even expressing more enthusiasm for the match than Mary herself. With Windibank’s frequent absences due to his business, plans for a quiet wedding at St. Saviour's near King’s Cross were arranged. Angel was eager to marry before Windibank’s anticipated return, impressing upon Mary the seriousness of their commitment and making her swear on the Testament that she would remain true to him under any circumstances—an arguably ominous request validated later by subsequent events.\n\nThe day of the wedding presents the central mystery: Hosmer Angel arrives to escort Mary and her mother to church. Due to the odd circumstance of two passengers, Angel rides in one hansom cab with Mary and her mother, while he himself chooses to follow in a separate four-wheeler cab. Upon arrival at the church, Mary and her mother wait for Angel to disembark from his vehicle—but he never emerges. The cabman confirms that Angel definitely got into his carriage at the street but vanished before entering the church, an unexplainable disappearance that remains unsolved as of the previous Friday. Since that day, Mary has had no contact with Angel, Nor any information regarding his whereabouts.\n\nDespite this troubling turn of events, Mary does not believe Angel intentionally abandoned her, pointing instead to his persistent admonition that she remained faithful and his prior assurances of unwavering affection. She interprets his strange behavior on the morning of the wedding—the intense requests for loyalty and his odd whispered warnings—as indicative that some unforeseen tragedy or coercion befell him. The correspondence, the secret meetings, and his nervousness about being conspicuous all hint at a man guarding his privacy for reasons unknown.\n\nHolmes, with characteristic insight, sympathizes with Mary’s predicament and notes the unfairness of her treatment, while carefully probing her understanding of Angel’s sudden disappearance. He recognizes the importance of the small and peculiar details Mary provides—the timing and nature of her stepfather's absences, the use of Post Office boxes for secrecy, the inconsistencies about Angel’s living arrangements, and the incongruous events of the wedding day. Holmes understands that beneath the surface of this seemingly straightforward disappearance lies a complex web that will demand careful deduction.\n\nTaken together, the two segments of the story establish a rich context for investigation. The narrative combines Holmes’s philosophical reflections on real-life mysteries with a concrete, emotionally charged case involving social constraints, family tensions, secretive behavior, and vanishing persons. Mary Sutherland emerges as a sympathetic and earnest client, caught between her loyalty and affection for Hosmer Angel and the baffling, almost theatrical nature of his disappearance. The dynamics in her family—especially the obstructive presence of a younger, controlling stepfather—and the various social nuances of the time add layers of complexity to the case.\n\nUltimately, the mystery poses many compelling questions: Who exactly is Hosmer Angel? Why did he insist on such secrecy and urgency? What became of him at the moment he was to take Mary to be married? And how might her stepfather fit into these puzzling events? Holmes is uniquely suited to unravel this conundrum, as his appreciation for subtle behavioral clues, his disdain for assumptions, and his commitment to uncovering truth from the faintest of hints prepare him to dissect this “case of identity” that is anything but ordinary."

      "chunk_text": "“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\n“None.”\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising, “and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.”\n“Then you don't think I'll see him again?”\n“I fear not.”\n“Then what has happened to him?”\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle,” said she. “Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.”\n“Thank you. And your address?”\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\n“Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?”\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.”\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.”\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,” I remarked.\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it.”\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\n“'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\n“It surprised me.”\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.",

Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising, “and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.”\n“Then you don't think I'll see him again?”\n“I fear not.”\n“Then what has happened to him?”\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle,” said she. “Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.”\n“Thank you. And your address?”\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\n“Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?”\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.”\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.”\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,” I remarked.\n“Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it.”\n“Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\n“'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\n“It surprised me.”\n“But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.”\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "\"A Case of Identity\" begins with the celebrated detective Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson discussing the curious nature of reality and true-life mysteries, emphasizing how fact often surpasses fiction in complexity and intrigue. Holmes illustrates this with an example involving a husband’s strange habit of throwing his false teeth at his wife, underscoring his belief that real human behavior is subtler and more unexpected than the contrived twists of novels.\n\nThis philosophical exchange is interrupted when Miss Mary Sutherland arrives at 221B Baker Street seeking Holmes’s help in the baffling disappearance of her fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel. Mary is a modestly independent woman, living off a small inheritance and clerical work. Her family life is strained, particularly due to her domineering stepfather, Mr. Windibank, whose controlling behavior has impeded any intervention from authorities in the mysterious case. Mary recounts how her late father, a plumber by trade, had established a business which was sold off under questionable circumstances when her mother remarried Windibank, contributing to their financial decline. Holmes listens carefully, absorbing the social and economic context as he prepares to untangle the mystery.\n\nMary narrates how she met Hosmer Angel at a gasfitters’ ball—a social event linked to her father’s trade—where despite her stepfather’s objections, she and her mother attended with the family’s former foreman, Mr. Hardy. Hosmer Angel is described as a gentle, shy gentleman with weak eyes, often wearing tinted glasses, carrying a subdued air enabled by a lingering childhood ailment. He preferred evening walks to avoid attracting attention and showed small, intimate attentions, such as requesting handwritten letters over typed ones for their personal touch. These nuances reveal a man with secrets and caution, traits that Holmes finds significant.\n\nFollowing their meeting, Angel regularly visits Mary until Windibank’s return forestalls any further home meetings. Their communication continues through letters, sent to a Post Office box in Leadenhall Street, as Mary never knows his precise address or workplace beyond recalling he was a cashier somewhere on that street. Their relationship quickly deepens, leading to a swift engagement. Mary and her mother both approve of the match, though she notes Angel's insistence on secrecy and his bouts of nervousness. He makes Mary swear on the Testament to remain faithful, a vow emphasized in an unsettlingly urgent manner.\n\nOn the day planned for their wedding at St. Saviour’s near King’s Cross, Hosmer Angel arrives with Mary and her mother. Curiously, he chooses to travel separately in a four-wheeled cab while Mary and her mother share a hansom. Upon arriving at the church, Angel disappears mysteriously—not stepping out to join Mary and her mother. The cabman confirms Angel entered his carriage but vanished before reaching their destination. Since then, there has been no trace of him. Mary’s mother forbids any further discussion of the matter, and the family’s response only deepens the mystery. Mary struggles with sleepless nights and a frantic desire to understand what came of Hosmer Angel.\n\nThe turn of the narrative in the third segment brings a more intimate exploration of Mary’s emotional turmoil and Holmes’s methodical deductions. Mary repeats her belief that Angel foresaw some danger which explains his cryptic warnings, suggesting something dreadful befell him after he vanished. However, both she and her father dismiss notions of financial motive: Angel was independent and never sought her money, and the idea of someone having a grudge sufficient to entrap him seems odd. She confesses the mystery consumes her thoughts and peace of mind.\n\nHolmes reassures Mary, advising her to cease dwelling on the case and attempt to forget Hosmer Angel, although she solemnly vows to remain true and ready for his return. She hands Holmes a packet of letters and an advertisement she placed seeking Angel—fervent gestures reflecting her innocence and steadfast hope.\n\nAfter Mary departs, Holmes turns over the case with characteristic poise—lighting his pipe and contemplating. His observations extend beyond the facts Mary provided to the nuanced impressions she inadvertently left. He draws Watson’s attention to the importance of seemingly trivial details often missed by the casual observer. Holmes highlights Mary’s attire, noting her “pretty preposterous” hat and generally vulgar but comfortable appearance, subtly revealing clues to her character and circumstances.\n\nHolmes instructs Watson in the art of deductive observation using Mary’s appearance as an example. Taking particular interest in the plush fabric at her sleeves—marked by distinctive double lines made by pressing against a typewriter—and the evidence on her gloves and boots, Holmes deduces that Mary is a typist by profession and that she probably left home in haste, as revealed by her mismatched and only partly buttoned boots. Additionally, the indentations of a pince-nez on either side of her nose signal poor eyesight, and the combination of dress materials and worn areas reveal her social standing and habits. Holmes chides Watson not to rely on general impressions but to focus on minute, tangible details, hinting that these will prove vital in unraveling the mystery of Hosmer Angel.\n\nHolmes’s reflections suggest that despite the outwardly simple narrative of a vanished fiancé, the case is one of concealed identity and deception. The peculiar behaviors associated with Angel—the secrecy, the use of Post Office boxes instead of a fixed address, the absence of direct contact, and the dramatic vanishing act—coupled with Mary’s social position and family tensions, point to a scheme more elaborate than a mere disappearance.\n\nTo summarize, the story so far unfolds as a layered investigation into the strange case of Miss Mary Sutherland and her missing fiancé, Hosmer Angel. The narrative melds social detail, emotional depth, and Holmes’s forensic scrutiny. Mary is a tragic figure caught at the intersection of love, loyalty, and mystery. Her stepfather’s obstructive influence, Angel’s secretive nature, and the symbolic moments like the wedding-day disappearance all signal a riddle involving identity and perhaps deceit. Holmes’s clinical attention to detail—down to the fabric and fit of Mary’s clothing—adds a forensic dimension to what initially appears as a romantic mystery. As Holmes embarks on his inquiry, the stage is set for revelations that transcend the obvious, promising to expose hidden motives behind the vanishing of Hosmer Angel, a figure whose very identity is questioned."

You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\nI held the little printed slip to the light.\n“Missing,” it said, “on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech.

Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing—”\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued, glancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\n“They are typewritten,” I remarked.\n“Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive.”\n“Of what?”\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?”\n“I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.”\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked as I entered.\n“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?”\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.\n“This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?”\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes quietly; “I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “I am delighted to hear it,” he said.\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the ‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.”\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s' slurred and the ‘r’s' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.”\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.”\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door.",

The narrative begins at 221B Baker Street, where Holmes and Dr. Watson deliberate on the nature of reality and mystery, setting the stage for a case that is as much about human psychology and social dynamics as it is about concealment and deception.\n\nThe focal point of the story is Miss Mary Sutherland, a modest and somewhat constrained woman caught in a distressing predicament: the baffling disappearance of her fiancé, Mr. Hosmer Angel. Mary, whose upbringing was marred by the domineering presence of her stepfather, Mr. Windibank, and the fading fortunes of her late father’s plumbing business, seeks Holmes’s assistance in unraveling the strange events that led to Angel’s vanishing on the very day they were to be married.\n\nMary’s narrative reveals a gentlemanly yet secretive fiancé, characterized by his shy demeanor, weak eyesight—evidenced by his tinted glasses—and a cautious insistence on secrecy. He preferred avoiding social exposure by taking evening walks rather than journeys in daylight, and communicated exclusively via handwritten letters directed to a Post Office box, never giving Mary a precise home or office address beyond a vague location on Leadenhall Street. The relationship, though brief, developed quickly, culminating in a wedding ceremony disrupted by Angel’s sudden and mysterious disappearance. He arrived separately in a four-wheeled cab; after entering the vehicle, he inexplicably vanished en route to the church, leaving Mary and her mother bewildered and emotionally devastated.\n\nThroughout Mary’s recitation, Holmes paid close attention to subtle details, recognizing in Mary’s appearance and mannerisms clues that extended beyond the immediate facts. He discerned from the wear of her gloves and boots, the marks left on her clothing, and even the indentations on her nose that she was a typist who had hurriedly left home that morning. These observations underscored the importance of minute evidence in constructing a fuller picture of the mystery.\n\nHolmes’s scrutiny extended to the letters Mary presented, all of which were typewritten, including the signatures. This oddity caught Holmes’s attention; the mechanical and standardized nature of the letters, coupled with the lack of personal handwriting, suggested an impersonation. The appearance of Hosmer Angel—a man described in a printed missing-persons advertisement with specific physical traits such as black hair, a sallow complexion, tinted glasses, and distinctive clothing—was contrasted by the unnatural secrecy surrounding his identity and movements. Holmes recognized the typewriting peculiarities, noting distinct and consistent flaws across multiple letters that reflected the characteristics of a particular typewriter, thereby suggesting they all originated from the same machine.\n\nInvoking his deep well of experience and observation, Holmes demonstrated to Watson the uniqueness that even a typewriter imprint could possess, likening its features to a signature of identity. This recognition led Holmes to write two strategic letters: one to a firm in the City, presumed to be Hosmer Angel’s place of employment or connection, and another to Mr. James Windibank, Mary’s stepfather, inviting him to a meeting.\n\nWhen Windibank arrived, he presented himself with a smooth but cautious demeanor, reflecting a man eager to appear cooperative but subtly defensive. Holmes engaged him on the subject of the correspondence, illuminating the nuances of typewriter individuality and pressing the point that the four letters supposedly from Hosmer Angel all bore the identical mechanical fingerprints of one machine—the very one used at Windibank’s office. This revelation implied that the letters, and by extension the identity of Hosmer Angel, were fabrications crafted by someone with access to the office typewriter.\n\nWindibank’s reaction was telling: startled and dismissive, he abruptly ended the discussion and departed, unwilling to entertain further scrutiny into the affair. Holmes’s curt dismissal of Windibank’s evasion by locking the door behind him symbolized a metaphorical closing of pretense and an assertion of control over the investigative process.\n\nReflecting on this, Holmes noted that although the case lacked the dramatic flair of other adventures, its subtlety did not lessen its intrigue. Unlike violent crimes or overt villainy, this case involved a quiet deception, possibly motivated by financial or personal gain, that exploited social vulnerabilities and the limited opportunities available to women like Mary. Holmes foresaw that the legal system might remain powerless, as the culprit’s actions skirted outright criminality in terms of evidentiary proof, resting instead in the realm of social manipulation and moral culpability.\n\nHolmes’s detection thus exposed the truth behind the illusory fiancé: Hosmer Angel was not a real individual but a constructed identity created and controlled by Mr. Windibank to prevent Mary’s advantageous marriage and possibly to keep the family’s modest inheritance within his reach. The mysterious disappearance on the wedding day, the vague addresses, the typewritten letters bearing the unmistakable imprint of Windibank’s office typewriter—all coalesced into a portrait of calculated deceit designed to break Mary’s hopes and maintain Windibank’s dominance.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, Mary remains a tragic figure—ignorant of the manipulation to which she has been subjected, steadfast in her loyalty, and tragically betrayed by those closest to her. The story encapsulates themes of societal control, the fragility of individual agency in the face of dominant patriarchal figures, and how appearances can be meticulously fashioned to mislead.\n\nHolmes’s mastery lies in his ability to synthesize psychological insight, forensic observation, and logical deduction, peeling back layers of social convention and deception to reveal the hidden realities beneath. “A Case of Identity” thereby transcends a simple missing-person tale, becoming a study in human motive, the misuse of power, and the importance of minute details—virtually overlooked by others—that unmask truth.\n\nIn conclusion, the case, once thought simply a vanished fiancé mystery, is resolved through Holmes’s patient inquiry and expert scrutiny. The ostensible victim, Hosmer Angel, never existed beyond a false persona constructed to manipulate and control. The actual architect is Mary’s stepfather, whose motives likely blend familial control with financial interest. Holmes’s final words underline the social limitations of justice in such matters, pointing to a world where not every wrong finds redress through law but through the illumination of truth. Thus, the story closes as a testament to Holmes’s enduring commitment to uncovering reality regardless of its discomfort and complexity."
