It was quite brief, and was headed \"Terrible Murder in Kent,\" the account being as follows:\n\"A shocking crime was discovered yesterday morning at the little town of Woldhurst, which lies on the branch line from Halbury Junction. The discovery was made by a porter who was inspecting the carriages of the train which had just come in. On opening the door of a first-class compartment, he was horrified to find the body of a fashionably-dressed woman stretched upon the floor. Medical aid was immediately summoned, and on the arrival of the divisional surgeon, Dr. Morton, it was ascertained that the woman had not been dead more than a few minutes.\n\"The state of the corpse leaves no doubt that a murder of a most brutal kind has been perpetrated, the cause of death being a penetrating wound of the head, inflicted with some pointed implement, which must have been used with terrible violence, since it has perforated the skull and entered the brain. That robbery was not the motive of the crime is made clear by the fact that an expensively fitted dressing-bag was found on the rack, and that the dead woman's jewellery, including several valuable diamond rings, was untouched. It is rumoured that an arrest has been made by the local police.\"\n\"A gruesome affair,\" I remarked, as I handed back the paper, \"but the report does not give us much information.\"\n\"It does not,\" Thorndyke agreed, \"and yet it gives us something to consider. Here is a perforating wound of the skull, inflicted with some pointed implement—that is, assuming that it is not a bullet wound. Now, what kind of implement would be capable of inflicting such an injury? How would such an implement be used in the confined space of a railway-carriage, and what sort of person would be in possession of such an implement? These are preliminary questions that are worth considering, and I commend them to you, together with the further problems of the possible motive—excluding robbery—and any circumstances other than murder which might account for the injury.\"\n\"The choice of suitable implements is not very great,\" I observed.\n\"It is very limited, and most of them, such as a plasterer's pick or a geological hammer, are associated with certain definite occupations. You have a notebook?\"\nI had, and, accepting the hint, I produced it and pursued my further reflections in silence, while my companion, with his notebook also on his knee, gazed steadily out of the window. And thus he remained, wrapped in thought, jotting down an entry now and again in his book, until the train slowed down at Halbury Junction, where we had to change on to a branch line.\nAs we stepped out, I noticed a well-dressed man hurrying up the platform from the rear and eagerly scanning the faces of the few passengers who had alighted. Soon he espied us, and, approaching quickly, asked, as he looked from one of us to the other:\n\"Dr. Thorndyke?\"\n\"Yes,\" replied my colleague, adding: \"And you, I presume, are Mr. Edward Stopford?\"\nThe solicitor bowed. \"This is a dreadful affair,\" he said, in an agitated manner. \"I see you have the paper. A most shocking affair. I am immensely relieved to find you here. Nearly missed the train, and feared I should miss you.\"\n\"There appears to have been an arrest,\" Thorndyke began.\n\"Yes—my brother. Terrible business. Let us walk up the platform; our train won't start for a quarter of an hour yet.\"\nWe deposited our joint Gladstone and Thorndyke's travelling-case in an empty first-class compartment, and then, with the solicitor between us, strolled up to the unfrequented end of the platform.\n\"My brother's position,\" said Mr. Stopford, \"fills me with dismay—but let me give you the facts in order, and you shall judge for yourself. This poor creature who has been murdered so brutally was a Miss Edith Grant. She was formerly an artist's model, and as such was a good deal employed by my brother, who is a painter—Harold Stopford, you know, A.R.A. now—\"\n\"I know his work very well, and charming work it is.\"\n\"I think so, too. Well, in those days he was quite a youngster—about twenty—and he became very intimate with Miss Grant, in quite an innocent way, though not very discreet; but she was a nice respectable girl, as most English models are, and no one thought any harm. However, a good many letters passed between them, and some little presents, amongst which was a beaded chain carrying a locket, and in this he was fool enough to put his portrait and the inscription, 'Edith, from Harold.'\n\"Later on Miss Grant, who had a rather good voice, went on the stage, in the comic opera line, and, in consequence, her habits and associates changed somewhat; and, as Harold had meanwhile become engaged, he was naturally anxious to get his letters back, and especially to exchange the locket for some less compromising gift. The letters she eventually sent him, but refused absolutely to part with the locket.\n\"Now, for the last month Harold has been staying at Halbury, making sketching excursions into the surrounding country, and yesterday morning he took the train to Shinglehurst, the third station from here, and the one before Woldhurst.\n\"On the platform here he met Miss Grant, who had come down from London, and was going on to Worthing. They entered the branch train together, having a first-class compartment to themselves. It seems she was wearing his locket at the time, and he made another appeal to her to make an exchange, which she refused, as before. The discussion appears to have become rather heated and angry on both sides, for the guard and a porter at Munsden both noticed that they seemed to be quarrelling; but the upshot of the affair was that the lady snapped the chain, and tossed it together with the locket to my brother, and they parted quite amiably at Shinglehurst, where Harold got out. He was then carrying his full sketching kit, including a large holland umbrella, the lower joint of which is an ash staff fitted with a powerful steel spike for driving into the ground.\n\"It was about half-past ten when he got out at Shinglehurst; by eleven he had reached his pitch and got to work, and he painted steadily for three hours. Then he packed up his traps, and was just starting on his way back to the station, when he was met by the police and arrested.\n\"And now, observe the accumulation of circumstantial evidence against him. He was the last person seen in company with the murdered woman—for no one seems to have seen her after they left Munsden; he appeared to be quarrelling with her when she was last seen alive, he had a reason for possibly wishing for her death, he was provided with an implement—a spiked staff—capable of inflicting the injury which caused her death, and, when he was searched, there was found in his possession the locket and broken chain, apparently removed from her person with violence.\n\"Against all this is, of course, his known character—he is the gentlest and most amiable of men—and his subsequent conduct—imbecile to the last degree if he had been guilty; but, as a lawyer, I can't help seeing that appearances are almost hopelessly against him.\"\n\"We won't say 'hopelessly,'\" replied Thorndyke, as we took our places in the carriage, \"though I expect the police are pretty cocksure. When does the inquest open?\"",

      "summary": "In the opening segment of the detective story \"The Blue Sequin,\" the narrative introduces Dr. Thorndyke and his companion, Jervis, as they embark on a journey to investigate a recent and brutal murder that has taken place in the small town of Woldhurst, Kent. The story begins with Thorndyke anxiously scanning a crowded train platform, hoping to meet their contact, Mr. Edward Stopford, a solicitor from the firm Stopford and Myers. A telegram from Stopford had requested Thorndyke’s presence to direct the defense of an important case, with all expenses covered, but despite indications that Stopford was to travel on the 8:25 train from Charing Cross to Woldhurst, Thorndyke and Jervis initially miss him. Thorndyke’s concern grows, knowing they have lost the opportunity for any preliminary discussion, a crucial disadvantage in legal and investigative work.\n\nAs the train moves away from the platform, Thorndyke peers out the window speculating whether Stopford might have just managed to catch the train, possibly occupying a rear carriage. He expresses his disappointment at missing the chance to prepare more fully by discussing the details face-to-face beforehand. To occupy himself, Thorndyke buys and flips through a newspaper, attempting to glean any information on the case from the brief article published under the headline, \"Terrible Murder in Kent.\" The report describes a gruesome murder discovered the previous morning when a railway porter found the body of a fashionably dressed woman inside a first-class carriage. Medical examination by the divisional surgeon Dr. Morton determined that the woman had suffered a fatal, penetrating wound to the head caused by some pointed object used with brutal force. The article clarifies that robbery was not the motive, as the deceased's jewelry and an expensive dressing-bag were untouched. A rumor about an arrest by the local police is mentioned but without details.\n\nThorndyke and Jervis quickly begin analyzing the limited information available. Thorndyke muses over what implements could cause such a wound—a wound that perforated the skull and damaged the brain—and how such a weapon could be wielded within the restricted space of a railway carriage. He suggests that most possible instruments capable of inflicting such an injury are linked to specific professions, like a plasterer’s pick or geological hammer, leading them to consider the victim’s or suspect’s potential occupation or environment. He also raises the question of alternative motives aside from robbery or even the possibility of a cause of death other than murder.\n\nUpon arriving at the Halbury Junction, where they transfer to a branch line headed toward Woldhurst, Thorndyke and Jervis finally encounter Mr. Edward Stopford. The solicitor is well-dressed but visibly agitated by the developments. He admits to the shocking nature of the case and expresses relief at their arrival. No time is wasted in discussing the recent arrest—the police have apprehended Stopford's brother, Harold Stopford, who is implicated in the murder.\n\nEdward Stopford explains the background of the victim and his brother’s relationship with her. The victim is identified as Miss Edith Grant, a woman who had previously worked as an artist's model, notably for Harold Stopford, an accomplished painter who had recently been made an Associate of the Royal Academy (A.R.A.). Their relationship, though entirely innocent, had been very close during the period when Harold was young and not yet engaged. During this time, many letters exchanged between them and small gifts had passed hands, notably a beaded chain carrying a locket with Harold’s portrait and the inscription \"Edith, from Harold.\"\n\nEdith Grant had later pursued a career on the stage, performing in comic opera, which changed her lifestyle and social connections. By then, Harold was engaged and wished to sever ties. He tried to retrieve the letters and especially to have the locket returned or replaced with something less compromising. The letters were eventually returned to Harold, but Edith refused to part with the locket. Reporting on recent events, Edward details how Harold had been staying in Halbury, making outdoor sketches. On the morning in question, Harold took the train to Shinglehurst, a station before Woldhurst, where he unexpectedly met Edith, who was traveling from London to Worthing.\n\nThey boarded a branch train together and occupied a first-class compartment. Edith wore the locket during the journey. Harold renewed his request for its return, but Edith refused as before, leading to a heated and angry exchange. This quarrel was noticed by the guard and a porter at Munsden station. Eventually, Edith snapped the chain and threw it together with the locket to Harold, after which they amicably parted ways at Shinglehurst, where Harold disembarked. He was carrying his sketching equipment, including a large holland umbrella whose lower joint doubled as a staff fitted with a powerful steel spike intended for driving into the ground—a weapon-like implement that becomes relevant to the case.\n\nHarold set up for sketching and painted for three hours but was arrested by the police on his way back to the station at approximately eleven o’clock. The circumstantial evidence laid against him is stark: he was the last person seen with Edith, witnessed quarrelling with her; he had a possible motive relating to the locket and perhaps jealousy or fear of scandal; he possessed an instrument capable of inflicting the fatal head wound—the spiked umbrella staff; and he was found in possession of the broken chain and locket presumably removed violently from Edith.\n\nDespite these compelling points, Edward emphasizes Harold’s well-known gentle and amiable nature, and his conduct after the fact, which does not suggest guilt but rather a lack of foresight or understanding of the seriousness of the situation. Still, Edward as a lawyer cannot deny that the appearances overwhelmingly stack against his brother. The segment ends with Thorndyke refraining from using the term “hopelessly” and inquiring about the schedule for the inquest, signaling the beginning of their active involvement in the investigation, combining legal and scientific reasoning to determine the truth behind the brutal murder and the questionable arrest.\n\nThis opening part sets the stage with a mixture of personal connections, an eerie murder scene, forensic curiosity about the weapon, and intense circumstantial evidence pointing toward a man close to the victim but potentially innocent. It also introduces Thorndyke’s analytical approach and the legal complexities faced by defense counsel in unraveling such a tangled and tragic affair."

      "chunk_text": "\"To-day at four. I have obtained an order from the coroner for you to examine the body and be present at the post-mortem.\"\n\"Do you happen to know the exact position of the wound?\"\n\"Yes; it is a little above and behind the left ear—a horrible round hole, with a ragged cut or tear running from it to the side of the forehead.\"\n\"And how was the body lying?\"\n\"Right along the floor, with the feet close to the off-side door.\"\n\"Was the wound on the head the only one?\"\n\"No; there was a long cut or bruise on the right cheek—a contused wound the police surgeon called it, which he believes to have been inflicted with a heavy and rather blunt weapon. I have not heard of any other wounds or bruises.\"\n\"Did anyone enter the train yesterday at Shinglehurst?\" Thorndyke asked.\n\"No one entered the train after it left Halbury.\"\nThorndyke considered these statements in silence, and presently fell into a brown study, from which he roused only as the train moved out of Shinglehurst station.\n\"It would be about here that the murder was committed,\" said Mr. Stopford; \"at least, between here and Woldhurst.\"\nThorndyke nodded rather abstractedly, being engaged at the moment in observing with great attention the objects that were visible from the windows.\n\"I notice,\" he remarked presently, \"a number of chips scattered about between the rails, and some of the chair-wedges look new. Have there been any platelayers at work lately?\"\n\"Yes,\" answered Stopford, \"they are on the line now, I believe—at least, I saw a gang working near Woldhurst yesterday, and they are said to have set a rick on fire; I saw it smoking when I came down.\"\n\"Indeed; and this middle line of rails is, I suppose, a sort of siding?\"\n\"Yes; they shunt the goods trains and empty trucks on to it. There are the remains of the rick—still smouldering, you see.\"\nThorndyke gazed absently at the blackened heap until an empty cattle-truck on the middle track hid it from view. This was succeeded by a line of goods-waggons, and these by a passenger coach, one compartment of which—a first-class—was closed up and sealed. The train now began to slow down rather suddenly, and a couple of minutes later we brought up in Woldhurst station.\nIt was evident that rumours of Thorndyke's advent had preceded us, for the entire staff—two porters, an inspector, and the station-master—were waiting expectantly on the platform, and the latter came forward, regardless of his dignity, to help us with our luggage.\n\"Do you think I could see the carriage?\" Thorndyke asked the solicitor.\n\"Not the inside, sir,\" said the station-master, on being appealed to. \"The police have sealed it up. You would have to ask the inspector.\"\n\"Well, I can have a look at the outside, I suppose?\" said Thorndyke, and to this the station-master readily agreed, and offered to accompany us.\n\"What other first-class passengers were there?\" Thorndyke asked.\n\"None, sir. There was only one first-class coach, and the deceased was the only person in it. It has given us all a dreadful turn, this affair has,\" he continued, as we set off up the line. \"I was on the platform when the train came in. We were watching a rick that was burning up the line, and a rare blaze it made, too; and I was just saying that we should have to move the cattle-truck that was on the mid-track, because, you see, sir, the smoke and sparks were blowing across, and I thought it would frighten the poor beasts. And Mr. Felton he don't like his beasts handled roughly. He says it spoils the meat.\"\n\"No doubt he is right,\" said Thorndyke. \"But now, tell me, do you think it is possible for any person to board or leave the train on the off-side unobserved? Could a man, for instance, enter a compartment on the off-side at one station and drop off as the train was slowing down at the next, without being seen?\"\n\"I doubt it,\" replied the station-master. \"Still, I wouldn't say it is impossible.\"\n\"Thank you. Oh, and there's another question. You have a gang of men at work on the line, I see. Now, do those men belong to the district?\"\n\"No, sir; they are strangers, every one, and pretty rough diamonds some of 'em are. But I shouldn't say there was any real harm in 'em. If you was suspecting any of 'em of being mixed up in this—\"\n\"I am not,\" interrupted Thorndyke rather shortly. \"I suspect nobody; but I wish to get all the facts of the case at the outset.\"\n\"Naturally, sir,\" replied the abashed official; and we pursued our way in silence.\n\"Do you remember, by the way,\" said Thorndyke, as we approached the empty coach, \"whether the off-side door of the compartment was closed and locked when the body was discovered?\"\n\"It was closed, sir, but not locked. Why, sir, did you think—?\"\n\"Nothing, nothing. The sealed compartment is the one, of course?\"\nWithout waiting for a reply, he commenced his survey of the coach, while I gently restrained our two companions from shadowing him, as they were disposed to do. The off-side footboard occupied his attention specially, and when he had scrutinized minutely the part opposite the fatal compartment, he walked slowly from end to end with his eyes but a few inches from its surface, as though he was searching for something.\nNear what had been the rear end he stopped, and drew from his pocket a piece of paper; then, with a moistened finger-tip he picked up from the footboard some evidently minute object, which he carefully transferred to the paper, folding the latter and placing it in his pocket-book.\nHe next mounted the footboard, and, having peered in through the window of the sealed compartment, produced from his pocket a small insufflator or powder-blower, with which he blew a stream of impalpable smoke-like powder on to the edges of the middle window, bestowing the closest attention on the irregular dusty patches in which it settled, and even measuring one on the jamb of the window with a pocket-rule. At length he stepped down, and, having carefully looked over the near-side footboard, announced that he had finished for the present.",

He also raises the question of alternative motives aside from robbery or even the possibility of a cause of death other than murder.\n\nUpon arriving at the Halbury Junction, where they transfer to a branch line headed toward Woldhurst, Thorndyke and Jervis finally encounter Mr. Edward Stopford. The solicitor is well-dressed but visibly agitated by the developments. He admits to the shocking nature of the case and expresses relief at their arrival. No time is wasted in discussing the recent arrest—the police have apprehended Stopford's brother, Harold Stopford, who is implicated in the murder.\n\nEdward Stopford explains the background of the victim and his brother’s relationship with her. The victim is identified as Miss Edith Grant, a woman who had previously worked as an artist's model, notably for Harold Stopford, an accomplished painter who had recently been made an Associate of the Royal Academy (A.R.A.). Their relationship, though entirely innocent, had been very close during the period when Harold was young and not yet engaged. During this time, many letters exchanged between them and small gifts had passed hands, notably a beaded chain carrying a locket with Harold’s portrait and the inscription \"Edith, from Harold.\"\n\nEdith Grant had later pursued a career on the stage, performing in comic opera, which changed her lifestyle and social connections. By then, Harold was engaged and wished to sever ties. He tried to retrieve the letters and especially to have the locket returned or replaced with something less compromising. The letters were eventually returned to Harold, but Edith refused to part with the locket. Reporting on recent events, Edward details how Harold had been staying in Halbury, making outdoor sketches. On the morning in question, Harold took the train to Shinglehurst, a station before Woldhurst, where he unexpectedly met Edith, who was traveling from London to Worthing.\n\nThey boarded a branch train together and occupied a first-class compartment. Edith wore the locket during the journey. Harold renewed his request for its return, but Edith refused as before, leading to a heated and angry exchange. This quarrel was noticed by the guard and a porter at Munsden station. Eventually, Edith snapped the chain and threw it together with the locket to Harold, after which they amicably parted ways at Shinglehurst, where Harold disembarked. He was carrying his sketching equipment, including a large holland umbrella whose lower joint doubled as a staff fitted with a powerful steel spike intended for driving into the ground—a weapon-like implement that becomes relevant to the case.\n\nHarold set up for sketching and painted for three hours but was arrested by the police on his way back to the station at approximately eleven o’clock. The circumstantial evidence laid against him is stark: he was the last person seen with Edith, witnessed quarrelling with her; he had a possible motive relating to the locket and perhaps jealousy or fear of scandal; he possessed an instrument capable of inflicting the fatal head wound—the spiked umbrella staff; and he was found in possession of the broken chain and locket presumably removed violently from Edith.\n\nDespite these compelling points, Edward emphasizes Harold’s well-known gentle and amiable nature, and his conduct after the fact, which does not suggest guilt but rather a lack of foresight or understanding of the seriousness of the situation. Still, Edward as a lawyer cannot deny that the appearances overwhelmingly stack against his brother. The segment ends with Thorndyke refraining from using the term “hopelessly” and inquiring about the schedule for the inquest, signaling the beginning of their active involvement in the investigation, combining legal and scientific reasoning to determine the truth behind the brutal murder and the questionable arrest.\n\nThis opening part sets the stage with a mixture of personal connections, an eerie murder scene, forensic curiosity about the weapon, and intense circumstantial evidence pointing toward a man close to the victim but potentially innocent. It also introduces Thorndyke’s analytical approach and the legal complexities faced by defense counsel in unraveling such a tangled and tragic affair.\n\nCurrent segment (part 2):\n\"To-day at four. I have obtained an order from the coroner for you to examine the body and be present at the post-mortem.\"\n\"Do you happen to know the exact position of the wound?\"\n\"Yes; it is a little above and behind the left ear—a horrible round hole, with a ragged cut or tear running from it to the side of the forehead.\"\n\"And how was the body lying?\"\n\"Right along the floor, with the feet close to the off-side door.\"\n\"Was the wound on the head the only one?\"\n\"No; there was a long cut or bruise on the right cheek—a contused wound the police surgeon called it, which he believes to have been inflicted with a heavy and rather blunt weapon. I have not heard of any other wounds or bruises.\"\n\"Did anyone enter the train yesterday at Shinglehurst?\" Thorndyke asked.\n\"No one entered the train after it left Halbury.\"\nThorndyke considered these statements in silence, and presently fell into a brown study, from which he roused only as the train moved out of Shinglehurst station.\n\"It would be about here that the murder was committed,\" said Mr. Stopford; \"at least, between here and Woldhurst.\"\nThorndyke nodded rather abstractedly, being engaged at the moment in observing with great attention the objects that were visible from the windows.\n\"I notice,\" he remarked presently, \"a number of chips scattered about between the rails, and some of the chair-wedges look new. Have there been any platelayers at work lately?\"\n\"Yes,\" answered Stopford, \"they are on the line now, I believe—at least, I saw a gang working near Woldhurst yesterday, and they are said to have set a rick on fire; I saw it smoking when I came down.\"\n\"Indeed; and this middle line of rails is, I suppose, a sort of siding?\"\n\"Yes; they shunt the goods trains and empty trucks on to it. There are the remains of the rick—still smouldering, you see.\"\nThorndyke gazed absently at the blackened heap until an empty cattle-truck on the middle track hid it from view. This was succeeded by a line of goods-waggons, and these by a passenger coach, one compartment of which—a first-class—was closed up and sealed. The train now began to slow down rather suddenly, and a couple of minutes later we brought up in Woldhurst station.\nIt was evident that rumours of Thorndyke's advent had preceded us, for the entire staff—two porters, an inspector, and the station-master—were waiting expectantly on the platform, and the latter came forward, regardless of his dignity, to help us with our luggage.\n\"Do you think I could see the carriage?\" Thorndyke asked the solicitor.\n\"Not the inside, sir,\" said the station-master, on being appealed to. \"The police have sealed it up. You would have to ask the inspector.\"\n\"Well, I can have a look at the outside, I suppose?\" said Thorndyke, and to this the station-master readily agreed, and offered to accompany us.\n\"What other first-class passengers were there?\" Thorndyke asked.\n\"None, sir. There was only one first-class coach, and the deceased was the only person in it. It has given us all a dreadful turn, this affair has,\" he continued, as we set off up the line. \"I was on the platform when the train came in. We were watching a rick that was burning up the line, and a rare blaze it made, too; and I was just saying that we should have to move the cattle-truck that was on the mid-track, because, you see, sir, the smoke and sparks were blowing across, and I thought it would frighten the poor beasts. And Mr. Felton he don't like his beasts handled roughly. He says it spoils the meat.\"\n\"No doubt he is right,\" said Thorndyke. \"But now, tell me, do you think it is possible for any person to board or leave the train on the off-side unobserved? Could a man, for instance, enter a compartment on the off-side at one station and drop off as the train was slowing down at the next, without being seen?\"\n\"I doubt it,\" replied the station-master. \"Still, I wouldn't say it is impossible.\"\n\"Thank you. Oh, and there's another question. You have a gang of men at work on the line, I see. Now, do those men belong to the district?\"\n\"No, sir; they are strangers, every one, and pretty rough diamonds some of 'em are. But I shouldn't say there was any real harm in 'em. If you was suspecting any of 'em of being mixed up in this—\"\n\"I am not,\" interrupted Thorndyke rather shortly. \"I suspect nobody; but I wish to get all the facts of the case at the outset.\"\n\"Naturally, sir,\" replied the abashed official; and we pursued our way in silence.\n\"Do you remember, by the way,\" said Thorndyke, as we approached the empty coach, \"whether the off-side door of the compartment was closed and locked when the body was discovered?\"\n\"It was closed, sir, but not locked. Why, sir, did you think—?\"\n\"Nothing, nothing. The sealed compartment is the one, of course?\"\nWithout waiting for a reply, he commenced his survey of the coach, while I gently restrained our two companions from shadowing him, as they were disposed to do. The off-side footboard occupied his attention specially, and when he had scrutinized minutely the part opposite the fatal compartment, he walked slowly from end to end with his eyes but a few inches from its surface, as though he was searching for something.\nNear what had been the rear end he stopped, and drew from his pocket a piece of paper; then, with a moistened finger-tip he picked up from the footboard some evidently minute object, which he carefully transferred to the paper, folding the latter and placing it in his pocket-book.\nHe next mounted the footboard, and, having peered in through the window of the sealed compartment, produced from his pocket a small insufflator or powder-blower, with which he blew a stream of impalpable smoke-like powder on to the edges of the middle window, bestowing the closest attention on the irregular dusty patches in which it settled, and even measuring one on the jamb of the window with a pocket-rule. At length he stepped down, and, having carefully looked over the near-side footboard, announced that he had finished for the present.\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "In \"The Blue Sequin,\" a gripping detective story set in the English countryside, we follow Dr. Thorndyke and his companion Jervis as they journey to Woldhurst, Kent, to investigate the brutal murder of Edith Grant, a woman found dead under mysterious and violent circumstances in a railway carriage. The case is complicated by the arrest of Harold Stopford, an artist and the brother of their contact, solicitor Edward Stopford, who is desperate to prove his brother’s innocence.\n\nThe story begins with Thorndyke and Jervis racing to find Edward Stopford at the train station, having missed him initially. They catch up at a junction en route to Woldhurst, where Edward supplies crucial background information. Edith Grant, formerly an artist’s model and now a comic opera performer, had been very close to Harold during his early career as a painter. Their youthful friendship had involved exchanging letters and gifts, notably a beaded chain with a locket bearing Harold’s portrait and the inscription, \"Edith, from Harold.\"\n\nAs Edith’s stage career progressed and Harold became engaged, he sought to sever ties, especially to reclaim the compromising chain and locket. Though the letters were returned, Edith refused to give up the locket. On the morning of the murder, Harold took the train to Shinglehurst and unexpectedly met Edith on the way. Riding together in a first-class compartment, the pair argued once again over the locket, witnessed by railway staff. After a heated exchange, Edith broke the chain and threw the locket to Harold, who left the train at Shinglehurst to sketch nearby.\n\nHarold’s possession of a spiked umbrella, a staff with a steel spike, and the broken chain found with him raised suspicion. He was arrested shortly afterward, and the circumstantial evidence—the quarrel, the chain, the powerful weapon-like umbrella, and being the last person seen with Edith—largely condemns him. Yet Edward Stopford stresses his brother’s gentle nature and protests his innocence, underscoring the challenge for Thorndyke and the defense.\n\nThe investigation intensifies as Thorndyke and company travel towards Woldhurst, arriving just before the scheduled inquest. Edward has secured an order for Thorndyke to examine the body and be present at the post-mortem, a vital opportunity to bring scientific scrutiny to the case.\n\nEdward provides more details on the wound’s precise location: a dreadful round hole just above and behind Edith’s left ear, accompanied by a ragged tear or cut extending to the side of the forehead. This, along with a blunt contusion or bruise on her right cheek, suggests multiple blows with different instruments or at least different types of force. The body was discovered lying lengthwise on the compartment floor, feet near the door. No other wounds were reported.\n\nThorndyke probes the railway circumstances. He asks if anyone boarded the train after it left Halbury, to which Edward confirms no one entered after that point. This is crucial as it restricts potential suspects on the train itself. The timing and location of the murder come under scrutiny as the train passes Shinglehurst station. Stopford suggests the crime likely took place between there and Woldhurst, a notion Thorndyke accepts, but remains deeply contemplative.\n\nPeering out the window, Thorndyke notices chips scattered between the rails and notes the presence of workmen currently repairing the railway line, including a smouldering rick of hay nearby. He inquires about the nature of the track—a siding used for shunting goods wagons—and the composition of the workers, who are strangers to the district and considered \"rough diamonds.\" Although their presence is noted, Thorndyke expressly denies suspecting them but acknowledges the necessity of including all facts in the investigation.\n\nAt Woldhurst station, they are met with marked anticipation. The station staff, aware of the murder and incoming investigators, warmly assist the visitors despite the grim circumstances. Thorndyke requests permission to view the murder compartment but is told the police have sealed it, and only the outside can be seen.\n\nThe station-master recounts the evening of the murder, including the ongoing fire on the line, which required moving a cattle truck to avoid frightening the livestock—details form a subtle but telling backdrop to the mysterious events. When asked if it would be possible for someone to enter or leave the train unnoticed on the off-side, the station-master expresses doubt but does not rule it out entirely, introducing a possible angle for clandestine movement.\n\nThorndyke then turns his attention to the carriage itself. He examines the off-side footboard carefully, inspecting for any trace or sign that might suggest how or if someone had gained access to the compartment. He notes the door to the compartment was found closed but not locked, an important distinction that could indicate forced or easy entry. His meticulous search includes running his eyes close to the footboard, perhaps looking for marks or residue left behind.\n\nNear the rear of the carriage, Thorndyke picks up a minute object, barely visible to the naked eye, using a moistened fingertip to lift it delicately and place it on paper inside his notebook—an example of the scientific precision he will bring to the case.\n\nSubsequently, he inspects the window edges using a powder-blower, applying a fine dusting of a smoke-like powder to reveal fingerprints, irregular dust patterns, or any disturbance that could betray the presence of a person or object around the window. Measuring a dusty patch objectively, he demonstrates the use of forensic techniques to uncover clues imperceptible to others.\n\nAfter also examining the near-side footboard, Thorndyke announces he has completed his initial physical investigation of the outside of the compartment, foreshadowing the deeper analysis he will conduct during the post-mortem and further inspection of the carriage’s interior.\n\nTaken together, the narrative combines vivid character background, intricate circumstantial evidence, and meticulous forensic inquiry. Thorndyke’s scientific mind and precise observation offer a contrast to the tunnel vision that the police or the public might exercise by focusing solely on evidence that appears damning against Harold Stopford.\n\nThe details of the wounds—the penetrating spike-like injury and a blunt contusion—the locked versus unlocked door, the possible presence or absence of other people boarding or leaving the train in that critical stretch, and the physical conditions of the track and carriage all converge into a complex puzzle.\n\nMoreover, the social and emotional dynamics—Harold’s fraught relationship with Edith, the broken chain and locket, and the prior quarrel witnessed by others—offer motives but also potentially misleading interpretations. Thorndyke remains circumspect, gathering facts, measuring, and observing before drawing conclusions.\n\nAs the narrative progresses toward the inquest and post-mortem examination, the story sets up a collision between emotional suspicion based on appearances and scientific analysis guided by facts. The evolving investigation holds promise for unraveling the truth behind Edith Grant’s tragic death and clearing or implicating Harold Stopford beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThis second segment deepens the mystery by adding forensic details and situating the murder in a very specific time and place on the railway line, while preserving the personal and legal stakes introduced earlier. Thorndyke’s role as both a scientist and legal ally becomes increasingly vital as the case unfolds, emphasizing themes of rigorous investigation, the perils of circumstantial evidence, and the complex interplay of human relationships in crime."

      "chunk_text": "As we were returning down the line, we passed a working man, who seemed to be viewing the chairs and sleepers with more than casual interest.\n\"That, I suppose, is one of the plate-layers?\" Thorndyke suggested to the station-master.\n\"Yes, the foreman of the gang,\" was the reply.\n\"I'll just step back and have a word with him, if you will walk on slowly.\" And my colleague turned back briskly and overtook the man, with whom he remained in conversation for some minutes.\n\"I think I see the police inspector on the platform,\" remarked Thorndyke, as we approached the station.\n\"Yes, there he is,\" said our guide. \"Come down to see what you are after, sir, I expect.\" Which was doubtless the case, although the officer professed to be there by the merest chance.\n\"You would like to see the weapon, sir, I suppose?\" he remarked, when he had introduced himself.\n\"The umbrella-spike,\" Thorndyke corrected. \"Yes, if I may. We are going to the mortuary now.\"\n\"Then you'll pass the station on the way; so, if you care to look in, I will walk up with you.\"\nThis proposition being agreed to, we all proceeded to the police-station, including the station-master, who was on the very tiptoe of curiosity.\n\"There you are, sir,\" said the inspector, unlocking his office, and ushering us in. \"Don't say we haven't given every facility to the defence. There are all the effects of the accused, including the very weapon the deed was done with.\"\n\"Come, come,\" protested Thorndyke; \"we mustn't be premature.\" He took the stout ash staff from the officer, and, having examined the formidable spike through a lens, drew from his pocket a steel calliper-gauge, with which he carefully measured the diameter of the spike, and the staff to which it was fixed. \"And now,\" he said, when he had made a note of the measurements in his book, \"we will look at the colour-box and the sketch. Ha! a very orderly man, your brother. Mr. Stopford. Tubes all in their places, palette-knives wiped clean, palette cleaned off and rubbed bright, brushes wiped—they ought to be washed before they stiffen—all this is very significant.\" He unstrapped the sketch from the blank canvas to which it was pinned, and, standing it on a chair in a good light, stepped back to look at it.\n\"And you tell me that that is only three hours' work!\" he exclaimed, looking at the lawyer. \"It is really a marvellous achievement.\"\n\"My brother is a very rapid worker,\" replied Stopford dejectedly.\n\"Yes, but this is not only amazingly rapid; it is in his very happiest vein—full of spirit and feeling. But we mustn't stay to look at it longer.\" He replaced the canvas on its pins, and having glanced at the locket and some other articles that lay in a drawer, thanked the inspector for his courtesy and withdrew.\n\"That sketch and the colour-box appear very suggestive to me,\" he remarked, as we walked up the street.\n\"To me also,\" said Stopford gloomily, \"for they are under lock and key, like their owner, poor old fellow.\"\nHe sighed heavily, and we walked on in silence.\nThe mortuary-keeper had evidently heard of our arrival, for he was waiting at the door with the key in his hand, and, on being shown the coroner's order, unlocked the door, and we entered together; but, after a momentary glance at the ghostly, shrouded figure lying upon the slate table, Stopford turned pale and retreated, saying that he would wait for us outside with the mortuary-keeper.\nAs soon as the door was closed and locked on the inside, Thorndyke glanced curiously round the bare, whitewashed building. A stream of sunlight poured in through the skylight, and fell upon the silent form that lay so still under its covering-sheet, and one stray beam glanced into a corner by the door, where, on a row of pegs and a deal table, the dead woman's clothing was displayed.\n\"There is something unspeakably sad in these poor relics, Jervis,\" said Thorndyke, as we stood before them. \"To me they are more tragic, more full of pathetic suggestion, than the corpse itself. See the smart, jaunty hat, and the costly skirts hanging there, so desolate and forlorn; the dainty lingerie on the table, neatly folded—by the mortuary-man's wife, I hope—the little French shoes and open-work silk stockings. How pathetically eloquent they are of harmless, womanly vanity, and the gay, careless life, snapped short in the twinkling of an eye. But we must not give way to sentiment. There is another life threatened, and it is in our keeping.\"\nHe lifted the hat from its peg, and turned it over in his hand. It was, I think, what is called a \"picture-hat\"—a huge, flat, shapeless mass of gauze and ribbon and feather, spangled over freely with dark-blue sequins. In one part of the brim was a ragged hole, and from this the glittering sequins dropped off in little showers when the hat was moved.\n\"This will have been worn tilted over on the left side,\" said Thorndyke, \"judging by the general shape and the position of the hole.\"\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"Like that of the Duchess of Devonshire in Gainsborough's portrait.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nHe shook a few of the sequins into the palm of his hand, and, replacing the hat on its peg, dropped the little discs into an envelope, on which he wrote, \"From the hat,\" and slipped it into his pocket. Then, stepping over to the table, he drew back the sheet reverently and even tenderly from the dead woman's face, and looked down at it with grave pity. It was a comely face, white as marble, serene and peaceful in expression, with half-closed eyes, and framed with a mass of brassy, yellow hair; but its beauty was marred by a long linear wound, half cut, half bruise, running down the right cheek from the eye to the chin.\n\"A handsome girl,\" Thorndyke commented—\"a dark-haired blonde. What a sin to have disfigured herself so with that horrible peroxide.\" He smoothed the hair back from her forehead, and added: \"She seems to have applied the stuff last about ten days ago. There is about a quarter of an inch of dark hair at the roots. What do you make of that wound on the cheek?\"\n\"It looks as if she had struck some sharp angle in falling, though, as the seats are padded in first-class carriages, I don't see what she could have struck.\"\n\"No. And now let us look at the other wound. Will you note down the description?\" He handed me his notebook, and I wrote down as he dictated: \"A clean-punched circular hole in skull, an inch behind and above margin of left ear—diameter, an inch and seven-sixteenths; starred fracture of parietal bone; membranes perforated, and brain entered deeply; ragged scalp-wound, extending forward to margin of left orbit; fragments of gauze and sequins in edges of wound. That will do for the present. Dr. Morton will give us further details if we want them.\"\nHe pocketed his callipers and rule, drew from the bruised scalp one or two loose hairs, which he placed in the envelope with the sequins, and, having looked over the body for other wounds or bruises (of which there were none), replaced the sheet, and prepared to depart.\nAs we walked away from the mortuary, Thorndyke was silent and deeply thoughtful, and I gathered that he was piecing together the facts that he had acquired. At length Mr. Stopford, who had several times looked at him curiously, said:\n\"The post-mortem will take place at three, and it is now only half-past eleven. What would you like to do next?\"\nThorndyke, who, in spite of his mental preoccupation, had been looking about him in his usual keen, attentive way, halted suddenly.\n\"Your reference to the post-mortem,\" said he, \"reminds me that I forgot to put the ox-gall into my case.\"\n\"Ox-gall!\" I exclaimed, endeavouring vainly to connect this substance with the technique of the pathologist. \"What were you going to do with—\"",

There are all the effects of the accused, including the very weapon the deed was done with.\"\n\"Come, come,\" protested Thorndyke; \"we mustn't be premature.\" He took the stout ash staff from the officer, and, having examined the formidable spike through a lens, drew from his pocket a steel calliper-gauge, with which he carefully measured the diameter of the spike, and the staff to which it was fixed. \"And now,\" he said, when he had made a note of the measurements in his book, \"we will look at the colour-box and the sketch. Ha! a very orderly man, your brother. Mr. Stopford. Tubes all in their places, palette-knives wiped clean, palette cleaned off and rubbed bright, brushes wiped—they ought to be washed before they stiffen—all this is very significant.\" He unstrapped the sketch from the blank canvas to which it was pinned, and, standing it on a chair in a good light, stepped back to look at it.\n\"And you tell me that that is only three hours' work!\" he exclaimed, looking at the lawyer. \"It is really a marvellous achievement.\"\n\"My brother is a very rapid worker,\" replied Stopford dejectedly.\n\"Yes, but this is not only amazingly rapid; it is in his very happiest vein—full of spirit and feeling. But we mustn't stay to look at it longer.\" He replaced the canvas on its pins, and having glanced at the locket and some other articles that lay in a drawer, thanked the inspector for his courtesy and withdrew.\n\"That sketch and the colour-box appear very suggestive to me,\" he remarked, as we walked up the street.\n\"To me also,\" said Stopford gloomily, \"for they are under lock and key, like their owner, poor old fellow.\"\nHe sighed heavily, and we walked on in silence.\nThe mortuary-keeper had evidently heard of our arrival, for he was waiting at the door with the key in his hand, and, on being shown the coroner's order, unlocked the door, and we entered together; but, after a momentary glance at the ghostly, shrouded figure lying upon the slate table, Stopford turned pale and retreated, saying that he would wait for us outside with the mortuary-keeper.\nAs soon as the door was closed and locked on the inside, Thorndyke glanced curiously round the bare, whitewashed building. A stream of sunlight poured in through the skylight, and fell upon the silent form that lay so still under its covering-sheet, and one stray beam glanced into a corner by the door, where, on a row of pegs and a deal table, the dead woman's clothing was displayed.\n\"There is something unspeakably sad in these poor relics, Jervis,\" said Thorndyke, as we stood before them. \"To me they are more tragic, more full of pathetic suggestion, than the corpse itself. See the smart, jaunty hat, and the costly skirts hanging there, so desolate and forlorn; the dainty lingerie on the table, neatly folded—by the mortuary-man's wife, I hope—the little French shoes and open-work silk stockings. How pathetically eloquent they are of harmless, womanly vanity, and the gay, careless life, snapped short in the twinkling of an eye. But we must not give way to sentiment. There is another life threatened, and it is in our keeping.\"\nHe lifted the hat from its peg, and turned it over in his hand. It was, I think, what is called a \"picture-hat\"—a huge, flat, shapeless mass of gauze and ribbon and feather, spangled over freely with dark-blue sequins. In one part of the brim was a ragged hole, and from this the glittering sequins dropped off in little showers when the hat was moved.\n\"This will have been worn tilted over on the left side,\" said Thorndyke, \"judging by the general shape and the position of the hole.\"\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"Like that of the Duchess of Devonshire in Gainsborough's portrait.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nHe shook a few of the sequins into the palm of his hand, and, replacing the hat on its peg, dropped the little discs into an envelope, on which he wrote, \"From the hat,\" and slipped it into his pocket. Then, stepping over to the table, he drew back the sheet reverently and even tenderly from the dead woman's face, and looked down at it with grave pity. It was a comely face, white as marble, serene and peaceful in expression, with half-closed eyes, and framed with a mass of brassy, yellow hair; but its beauty was marred by a long linear wound, half cut, half bruise, running down the right cheek from the eye to the chin.\n\"A handsome girl,\" Thorndyke commented—\"a dark-haired blonde. What a sin to have disfigured herself so with that horrible peroxide.\" He smoothed the hair back from her forehead, and added: \"She seems to have applied the stuff last about ten days ago. There is about a quarter of an inch of dark hair at the roots. What do you make of that wound on the cheek?\"\n\"It looks as if she had struck some sharp angle in falling, though, as the seats are padded in first-class carriages, I don't see what she could have struck.\"\n\"No. And now let us look at the other wound. Will you note down the description?\" He handed me his notebook, and I wrote down as he dictated: \"A clean-punched circular hole in skull, an inch behind and above margin of left ear—diameter, an inch and seven-sixteenths; starred fracture of parietal bone; membranes perforated, and brain entered deeply; ragged scalp-wound, extending forward to margin of left orbit; fragments of gauze and sequins in edges of wound. That will do for the present. Dr. Morton will give us further details if we want them.\"\nHe pocketed his callipers and rule, drew from the bruised scalp one or two loose hairs, which he placed in the envelope with the sequins, and, having looked over the body for other wounds or bruises (of which there were none), replaced the sheet, and prepared to depart.\nAs we walked away from the mortuary, Thorndyke was silent and deeply thoughtful, and I gathered that he was piecing together the facts that he had acquired. At length Mr. Stopford, who had several times looked at him curiously, said:\n\"The post-mortem will take place at three, and it is now only half-past eleven. What would you like to do next?\"\nThorndyke, who, in spite of his mental preoccupation, had been looking about him in his usual keen, attentive way, halted suddenly.\n\"Your reference to the post-mortem,\" said he, \"reminds me that I forgot to put the ox-gall into my case.\"\n\"Ox-gall!\" I exclaimed, endeavouring vainly to connect this substance with the technique of the pathologist. \"What were you going to do with—\"\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "In \"The Blue Sequin,\" a riveting detective story set against the backdrop of the English countryside and the inner workings of early 20th-century railway life, Dr. Thorndyke and his companion Jervis confront a perplexing murder investigation. The victim, Edith Grant—a former artist’s model turned comic opera performer—is discovered brutally slain in a first-class railway carriage, sending shockwaves through the local community of Woldhurst, Kent.\n\nThe central figure suspected in the crime is Harold Stopford, an artist and the brother of the solicitor Edward Stopford, who pleads fervently for his brother’s innocence. The tangled narrative reveals a fraught, complex history between Edith and Harold: youthful friendship turned sour, complicated by a broken engagement and an intensely disputed possession of a beaded chain with a locket inscribed, \"Edith, from Harold.\" Public confrontation between the two occurred on the morning of the murder aboard the train, where an argument over this very locket was witnessed by railway personnel. Subsequent to the quarrel, Harold left the train to sketch near Shinglehurst station, while Edith remained on board, only to be found murdered later.\n\nHarold’s arrest hinges on a confluence of circumstantial evidence: he was the last seen person with the victim, he carried a spiked umbrella—an ominous, weapon-like staff—that could have inflicted a fatal wound; the broken chain, unmistakably linked to the victim, was found in his possession; and prior animosity fueled suspicion. However, Edward’s heartfelt protestations and his knowledge of his brother’s gentle nature complicate the picture, demanding a deeper, more scientific examination of the facts.\n\nArriving in Woldhurst, Thorndyke undertakes a detailed inquiry that blends forensic science with acute observation. A pivotal aspect is the investigation of the railway carriage and surrounding environs. Thorndyke scrutinizes the murder compartment’s exterior and notes signs such as the unlocked door, chips scattered on the rails near a siding, and the presence of rough-working unknown laborers repairing the line—details which open hypothetical possibilities for movement on and off the train but do not immediately implicate the workers. The timing and exact location of the murder are refined: it most likely occurred after leaving Shinglehurst but before reaching Woldhurst. No additional passengers boarded after Halbury station, limiting suspect possibilities to those already present.\n\nIn the current segment of the story, Thorndyke’s methodical investigation delves further into the physical and circumstantial evidence surrounding the case. While returning along the railway line, Thorndyke engages a plate-layer foreman who is studying the sleepers and rails with marked interest. This interaction hints at the significance of the railway’s physical condition or recent disturbances, though Thorndyke maintains an open mind, refraining from assigning blame prematurely.\n\nBack at Woldhurst station, they encounter the local police inspector, who somewhat reluctantly provides access to the accused’s effects stored at the police station. Thorndyke reviews Harold Stopford’s belongings with a discerning eye—notably the spiked umbrella, which he carefully measures and examines, and a recently unfurled sketch on a blank canvas accompanied by a meticulously maintained color-box of paints and brushes. Thorndyke remarks admiringly on the rapidity and quality of the sketch, suggesting Harold’s disposition and state of mind at the time, signaling both his meticulous habits and possibly his mental disposition.\n\nThis exploration reveals a nuanced portrayal of the accused: a fastidious artist whose orderly nature contrasts sharply with the violent act he is accused of. Thorndyke’s assessment appears to cast subtle doubt on the simplistic assumptions of guilt, underscoring the importance of scientific analysis over circumstantial emotion.\n\nThe poignant moment at the mortuary follows, where Thorndyke and Jervis confront the stark reality of the victim’s lifeless body. Edward Stopford, overcome with emotion, elects to wait outside, leaving the investigators alone with the evidence. Thorndyke’s keen sensitivity and forensic acumen blend here as he solemnly observes Edith’s belongings displayed—the elegant, sequined picture-hat, the folded lingerie, the delicate shoes and silk stockings—all symbols of a vibrant, carefree life suddenly ended. The hat bears a ragged hole with sequins falling off, suggesting it was worn tilted over the left side, aligning with the position of the fatal wound.\n\nHis thorough examination of Edith’s body identifies two primary injuries: a grievous, circular puncture wound above and behind the left ear, featuring a “starred fracture” of the parietal bone with brain matter deeply penetrated—this wound appears to have been inflicted by a sharp, spike-like object likely matching the umbrella-spike found with Harold. In addition, there is a long linear bruise extending down the right cheek, half cut and half a contusion, resembling a blow against a sharp angle, though the exact cause remains a puzzle given the padded nature of first-class seats. Notably, no other injuries are found.\n\nThorndyke meticulously collects forensic samples from the scene, including a few loose hairs from the bruised scalp and the loose sequins from the hat, carefully storing them for further analysis. His clinical detachment is weighed against a clear empathy for the deceased, underscoring the tragic human element underpinning the investigative process.\n\nAs they depart the mortuary, the weight of the investigation settles palpably on the group. The facts amassed thus far—the nature of the wounds, the circumstances on the train, the emotional tensions surrounding the locket, Harold’s weapons and belongings, the physical setting of the murder, and the delicate forensic evidence on the victim’s person—form a complex tapestry that defies simple conclusions.\n\nThorndyke’s scientific approach is foregrounded by his reference to ox-gall, a reagent often used in chemical and microscopic examinations, signaling the transition from mere visual inspection to chemical analysis in the ongoing inquiry. This detail underscores the methodical, multifaceted nature of the investigation and Thorndyke’s role not just as a detective but as a scientist and expert forensic examiner.\n\nThroughout the unfolding narrative, \"The Blue Sequin\" deftly juxtaposes the emotive human elements—betrayal, jealousy, and desperation—with the impartial scrutiny of scientific method. The story meticulously explores the hazards of reliance on circumstantial evidence alone, especially when emotional bias threatens to overshadow the pursuit of truth. Thorndyke’s emerging conclusions, shaped by empirical observation and logical deduction rather than mere appearances, promise an unveiling of the true circumstances behind Edith Grant’s murder and the vindication or condemnation of Harold Stopford on rational grounds.\n\nThis third segment notably enriches the story by providing a detailed foray into the physical and psychological evidence associated with both victim and accused, setting the stage for the decisive post-mortem examination and further forensic tests that promise to illuminate the murky aspects of this compelling mystery."

      "chunk_text": "But here I broke off, remembering my friend's dislike of any discussion of his methods before strangers.\n\"I suppose,\" he continued, \"there would hardly be an artist's colourman in a place of this size?\"\n\"I should think not,\" said Stopford. \"But couldn't you got the stuff from a butcher? There's a shop just across the road.\"\n\"So there is,\" agreed Thorndyke, who had already observed the shop. \"The gall ought, of course, to be prepared, but we can filter it ourselves—that is, if the butcher has any. We will try him, at any rate.\"\nHe crossed the road towards the shop, over which the name \"Felton\" appeared in gilt lettering, and, addressing himself to the proprietor, who stood at the door, introduced himself and explained his wants.\n\"Ox-gall?\" said the butcher. \"No, sir, I haven't any just now; but I am having a beast killed this afternoon, and I can let you have some then. In fact,\" he added, after a pause, \"as the matter is of importance, I can have one killed at once if you wish it.\"\n\"That is very kind of you,\" said Thorndyke, \"and it would greatly oblige me. Is the beast perfectly healthy?\"\n\"They're in splendid condition, sir. I picked them out of the herd myself. But you shall see them—ay, and choose the one that you'd like killed.\"\n\"You are really very good,\" said Thorndyke warmly. \"I will just run into the chemist's next door, and get a suitable bottle, and then I will avail myself of your exceedingly kind offer.\"\nHe hurried into the chemist's shop, from which he presently emerged, carrying a white paper parcel; and we then followed the butcher down a narrow lane by the side of his shop. It led to an enclosure containing a small pen, in which were confined three handsome steers, whose glossy, black coats contrasted in a very striking manner with their long, greyish-white, nearly straight horns.\n\"These are certainly very fine beasts, Mr. Felton,\" said Thorndyke, as we drew up beside the pen, \"and in excellent condition, too.\"\nHe leaned over the pen and examined the beasts critically, especially as to their eyes and horns; then, approaching the nearest one, he raised his stick and bestowed a smart tap on the under-side of the right horn, following it by a similar tap on the left one, a proceeding that the beast viewed with stolid surprise.\n\"The state of the horns,\" explained Thorndyke, as he moved on to the next steer, \"enables one to judge, to some extent, of the beast's health.\"\n\"Lord bless you, sir,\" laughed Mr. Felton, \"they haven't got no feeling in their horns, else what good 'ud their horns be to 'em?\"\nApparently he was right, for the second steer was as indifferent to a sounding rap on either horn as the first. Nevertheless, when Thorndyke approached the third steer, I unconsciously drew nearer to watch; and I noticed that, as the stick struck the horn, the beast drew back in evident alarm, and that when the blow was repeated, it became manifestly uneasy.\n\"He don't seem to like that,\" said the butcher. \"Seems as if—Hullo, that's queer!\"\nThorndyke had just brought his stick up against the left horn, and immediately the beast had winced and started back, shaking his head and moaning. There was not, however, room for him to back out of reach, and Thorndyke, by leaning into the pen, was able to inspect the sensitive horn, which he did with the closest attention, while the butcher looked on with obvious perturbation.\n\"You don't think there's anything wrong with this beast, sir, I hope,\" said he.\n\"I can't say without a further examination,\" replied Thorndyke. \"It may be the horn only that is affected. If you will have it sawn off close to the head, and sent up to me at the hotel, I will look at it and tell you. And, by way of preventing any mistakes, I will mark it and cover it up, to protect it from injury in the slaughter-house.\"\nHe opened his parcel and produced from it a wide-mouthed bottle labelled \"Ox-gall,\" a sheet of gutta-percha tissue, a roller bandage, and a stick of sealing-wax. Handing the bottle to Mr. Felton, he encased the distal half of the horn in a covering by means of the tissue and the bandage, which he fixed securely with the sealing-wax.\n\"I'll saw the horn off and bring it up to the hotel myself, with the ox-gall,\" said Mr. Felton. \"You shall have them in half an hour.\"\nHe was as good as his word, for in half an hour Thorndyke was seated at a small table by the window of our private sitting-room in the Black Bull Hotel. The table was covered with newspaper, and on it lay the long grey horn and Thorndyke's travelling-case, now open and displaying a small microscope and its accessories. The butcher was seated solidly in an armchair waiting, with a half-suspicious eye on Thorndyke for the report; and I was endeavouring by cheerful talk to keep Mr. Stopford from sinking into utter despondency, though I, too, kept a furtive watch on my colleague's rather mysterious proceedings.\nI saw him unwind the bandage and apply the horn to his ear, bending it slightly to and fro. I watched him, as he scanned the surface closely through a lens, and observed him as he scraped some substance from the pointed end on to a glass slide, and, having applied a drop of some reagent, began to tease out the scraping with a pair of mounted needles. Presently he placed the slide under the microscope, and, having observed it attentively for a minute or two, turned round sharply.\n\"Come and look at this, Jervis,\" said he.\nI wanted no second bidding, being on tenterhooks of curiosity, but came over and applied my eye to the instrument.\n\"Well, what is it?\" he asked.\n\"A multipolar nerve corpuscle—very shrivelled, but unmistakable.\"\n\"And this?\"\nHe moved the slide to a fresh spot.\n\"Two pyramidal nerve corpuscles and some portions of fibres.\"\n\"And what do you say the tissue is?\"\n\"Cortical brain substance, I should say, without a doubt.\"\n\"I entirely agree with you.

      "summary": "“The Blue Sequin” is a meticulously constructed detective story weaving together elements of forensic science, human drama, and the atmospheric milieu of early 20th-century England. The narrative centers on the grisly murder of Edith Grant, an artist’s model turned comic opera singer, found brutally slain in a railway first-class carriage traveling through Woldhurst, Kent. The prime suspect, Harold Stopford, an artist with a troubled history involving the victim, faces arrest amid a swirl of circumstantial evidence and emotional turmoil.\n\nIn the early stages of the investigation, Dr. Thorndyke and his companion Jervis accompany Edward Stopford, Harold’s solicitor brother, into this tangled mystery. Edith and Harold’s relationship had been complex—childhood friends whose bond soured after a broken engagement and disputes over a cherished beaded chain and locket bearing an inscription from Harold to Edith. Witnesses confirm that Edith and Harold had a heated argument aboard the train, focusing on that very locket, before Harold stepped off to sketch landscapes near Shinglehurst station while Edith remained on the train. The murder occurred shortly after, with Edith’s body later discovered in the carriage.\n\nThe evidence against Harold seemed damning: he possessed the broken chain linked to Edith; his spiked umbrella matched the nature of the fatal wound observed; and he was the last person known to have been with Edith before her death. Yet Edward’s impassioned pleas for his brother’s innocence and Dr. Thorndyke’s insistence on scientific rigor prompted a deeper, more analytical investigation.\n\nArriving in Woldhurst, Thorndyke’s forensic approach cuts through suspicion and conjecture. He investigates the physical scene meticulously—the unlocked railway carriage door, chips on the rails near the siding, and the presence of laborers repairing the line—building a timeline and narrowing down the murder’s possible location and timing to after Shinglehurst but before Woldhurst, excluding other passengers boarding after an earlier station. This inquiry suggests a level of premeditation or opportunity that extends beyond the evident facts.\n\nAt the police station, further scrutiny of Harold’s belongings reveals details reflecting the man’s personality and state of mind. Among his possessions are a spiked umbrella and a freshly completed sketch, signifying his methodical and refined artistic nature, contrasting sharply with the violence of the crime alleged. The sketch’s speed and quality showcase Harold as a disciplined artist, casting doubt on the simplistic narrative of a jealous murderer.\n\nThe examination at the mortuary is chilling and poignant. Thorndyke and Jervis, alone with Edith’s remains as Edward waits outside, survey the victim’s attire and wounds with detached empathy. The sequined picture-hat, elegant lingerie, and silk stockings evoke a tragic end to youthful vibrancy. The hat bears a ragged hole whose position coincides with a circular, penetrating wound above and behind Edith’s left ear—caused by an object resembling the spike on Harold’s umbrella. Also present is a linear bruise on the right cheek, the cause of which remains uncertain due to the plush padding of first-class seats. No other injuries are evident. Thorndyke collects hairs and sequins as forensic samples, bringing a scientific rigor to the emotional weight of the case.\n\nWith the conflict of circumstantial evidence and suppressed emotional biases weighing heavily, Thorndyke turns to chemical and microscopic analysis to unravel the truth. It is here the final segment of the narrative unfolds, documenting Thorndyke’s pragmatic ingenuity and the interplay between science and the investigation’s human elements.\n\nAware that ox-gall—a substance crucial for his microscopic analyses—is unavailable through typical artistic suppliers in the small rural town, Thorndyke explores alternative means. Harold and Thorndyke engage with the local butcher, Mr. Felton, who offers an exceptional willingness to assist, even suggesting the immediate slaughter of a healthy beast to provide fresh ox-gall. Thorndyke critically inspects the cattle in the pen, testing horn sensitivity as an indirect measure of health, and detects an anomaly with one steer’s horn, which responds to inspection with signs of pain. He instructs the butcher to excise this particular horn for his examination, carefully marking and preserving it. In half an hour, with the ox-gall acquired and the horn presented, Thorndyke sets about his laboratory work in a corner of their hotel.\n\nOpening his traveling microscope and cleaning his samples, Thorndyke scrapes material from the horn and prepares slides using ox-gall, then peers intently into his instrument. The discovery is astonishing: among the minute structures observed are multipolar and pyramidal nerve corpuscles, as well as fibers unmistakably identified as cortical brain substance. This finding is extraordinary because it establishes—without doubt—that the “horn” material is in fact brain tissue, not mere horn. Thorndyke’s conclusion is immediate and unequivocal: the object that caused Edith’s fatal wound could not have been a horn but was brain tissue. This implies that the fatal wound was inflicted not by Harold’s umbrella spike or any horn-like object, but by something else more consistent with brain matter.\n\nThis microscopic evidence fundamentally challenges the prosecution’s case. Thorndyke’s statement that “the case for the defence is practically complete” leaves Edward Stopford astounded, highlighting the scientific unraveling of the circumstantial accusations that had pinned guilt on his brother.\n\nThe narrative arc of “The Blue Sequin” thus emphasizes the tension between surface appearances and deeper truths. Initially, the physical evidence—witnessed quarrels, possession of the broken locket, and the umbrella spike—seemed to designate Harold as the culprit. However, Thorndyke’s investigation underscores the dangers of relying solely on circumstantial evidence, particularly in emotionally charged cases. His reliance on forensic science—meticulous scene examination, detailed post-mortem observations, chemical reagents, and microscopic tissue analysis—demonstrates a methodical and empirical approach to uncovering the truth, a mode of detection ahead of its time.\n\nMoreover, the story paints a richly detailed picture of its period’s social and cultural context: the significance of trains and the railway environment, the small-town dynamics of Woldhurst, and the character portrayal of an artist like Harold, blending personal tragedy with the social implications of the crime.\n\nIn conclusion, the story’s resolution hinges on scientific deduction that vindicates Harold Stopford, revealing the fatal weapon to be something other than the initially presumed umbrella spike, and thereby exposing the limitations of circumstantial inference. The poignant human elements—Edward’s despair, the victim’s tragic end, and Harold’s quiet dignity—are framed within Thorndyke’s unwavering commitment to truth through science. “The Blue Sequin” stands as a compelling exploration of how forensic expertise can penetrate the fog of suspicion and emotion, restoring justice where initial appearances deceive."
