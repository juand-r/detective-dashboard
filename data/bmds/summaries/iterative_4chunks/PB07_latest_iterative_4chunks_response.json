      "chunk_text": "“WE find that Letitia Woodriff was accidentally poisoned by morphia. How taken or administered there is not sufficient evidence before us to show, and we desire to express our profound sympathy with the afflicted father, Mr. Woodriff, in the sad bereavement that has befallen him.”\n* * *\nThe Coroner’s jury could reach no deeper than this in the perplexing mystery. Their verdict given, with grave faces and quiet tread they left the father’s house, where by special favour the inquest had been held.\nThen John Woodriff stole up softly, as though he feared to waken her, to the room where his dead daughter lay, beautiful in death. With a timid gentleness he touched the little hand cold and white on the coverlet. The placid face with the still smile on the pale lips half frightened him. It seemed as if death had lifted his dear little girl—his own familiar pet and plaything—so far above him that even his thoughts could not reach to her now. It was no longer his girl that he had so loved and that so loved him, that lay there so calm and cold. An angel was in the room, pure and placid. His own bright, warm, loving Letty was lost to him for ever.\nWith a spasm of pain that gripped his very heartstrings, he bent over and kissed those poor chill lips passionately. The ice-cold touch stabbed him with a sudden agony of new grief, though his daughter was now two days dead. He pressed his face upon the counterpane, and his deep sobs shook the bed where the placid dead lay.\nThen the door opened softly and a face showed itself at the opening—a young girl’s face, wan and white, with red rims under the eyes.\n“Father,” said a soft voice, replete with tenderness, and Milly Woodriff stole to where her father knelt, shaken by sorrow, and threw her arm round his neck and strove to whisper words of comfort in his ear, though her own heart was breaking.\n“Don’t, father, don’t!” she said; “it would grieve her, even in heaven, to see you thus; she, who was always so gentle, so cheery, and so loving. It’s hard to bear, God knows, it’s hard to bear, but we have each other left to love and live for until we meet our darling again.”\nThe broken-hearted man yielded like a tired child to her caressing touch, and she led him from the room.\n“Thank God, Milly,” he whispered, “you are still left to me,” as they sat together with clasped hands in the big silent sitting-room, where even the sunlight seemed to come sadly now.\nA sudden fear, a pang of sharp remembrance came upon him as he spoke. He caught her hand so tightly that he hurt it. “Oh! my God,” he cried, in a sort of frenzy, “must I lose her too!”\nAfter that he sat for a long time looking at her earnestly, softly stroking the brown silky hair, and all the time a yearning, frightened look in his eyes.\nPresently he seemed to steady himself with an effort, like one who has a purpose in view.\n“Has any one come by the train, Milly?” he asked.\n“The train is hardly in yet, father,” she answered, with a glance at the marble clock on the mantelpiece, “and it’s a good half-hour from town, you know. Do you expect any one?”\n“I wired the day before yesterday to London for a detective—a man named Beck—Paul Beck. We were at school together, and great friends then, though we have not met since. I have heard he is the keenest detective in London. I hoped to have had him down for the inquest. If any man can find out how poor Letty died, he can.”\n“What’s the use, father, of worrying over that now? It will only help to keep the wound open in your heart. It won’t bring our darling back to us.”\n“Milly,” he said, with such earnestness he frightened her, “I would give my right hand this moment to know how death came to poor Letty.”\nThere was silence again. Presently he asked abruptly, “Where is Susan?”\n“In her room, father, utterly broken down. She has hardly eaten or slept since. In some things Susan is like a little child, and she and Letty were such friends!”\n“Go to her, my dear. You will comfort each other. I’m restless and impatient for this man to come. I’ll walk down a bit of the road and meet him.”\nMr. Woodriff’s house was a tall, red-brick building that looked out from the breast of a wooded slope far over the sea. About three miles inland was the large and prosperous town of Deringham, where Mr. Woodriff, as an ironmaster, had acquired the ample fortune which enabled him to purchase the house and grounds of Merview, and live in comfort on the borders of the sea which he had loved from a boy.\nAs he strode steadily down the high-road, half-way between the town and his house, a hansom went past him rapidly. One quick glance showed him seated in it a placid, dull-looking man, whom he at once set down as a commercial traveller. But the hansom pulled up sharply before it had got twenty yards past. The dull-looking man leaped out like a schoolboy and ran back towards him, calling his name.\n“Don’t you know me, Jack?” he cried cordially, with hand outstretched. “I knew you at first sight.”\nMr. Woodriff looked for a moment bewildered; then a light dawned on him. “Surely you cannot be little Paul Beck?” he cried.\n“Little or great, I’m Paul Beck as surely as you are John Woodriff—the very same Paul Beck you saved from many a basting at school when I was a small boy, and you were a big one. I’m heartily sorry, Jack, that our first meeting again should be such a sad one.”\n“You got my wire, then?”\n“And your letter; both the same time. I was out of town when the wire came or I should have been down for the inquest. What was the verdict?”\n“Accidental death.”\nMr. Beck glanced at his face. “And what do you think yourself?”\n“I really don’t know what to think.”\nAgain Mr. Beck looked at him keenly and steadily. “You are horribly cut up, Jack, and all of a shiver. There is something else besides grief troubling you; something frightening you. I’ll send the cab on to the house; we will talk this thing out while we walk. I always feel most alone where there are no walls.”",

      "summary": "The first segment of “The Poisoner,” a detective story by an unknown author, opens with the conclusion of a coroner’s inquest into the death of Letitia Woodriff, who tragically died from morphia poisoning. The jury’s verdict is that her death was accidental, but the precise manner in which the poison was taken or administered remains a mystery due to insufficient evidence. This unresolved conclusion leaves the family and those involved in sorrow and uncertainty. The jury expresses their sympathy for Mr. John Woodriff, Letitia’s father, who is profoundly affected by the loss.\n\nFollowing the inquest, the narrative shifts to the intimate and heartrending personal grief of John Woodriff. He quietly ascends to the room where his daughter’s body lies, still and beautiful in death, struggling to accept the finality of her passing. The contrast between the lively child he knew and the peaceful, cold form before him strikes him deeply, stirring a blend of love, confusion, and despair. His sorrow manifests in a physical and emotional upheaval—he kisses Letitia’s cold lips and breaks down in uncontrollable sobs, overwhelmed by the sting of loss and the sharp reality of mortality.\n\nIn this poignant moment, Milly Woodriff, John’s other daughter, finds him and tries to offer comfort. She enters with a saddened appearance herself, showing the profound impact Letitia’s death has had on the family. Milly’s gentle words encourage her father to refrain from despair and to cherish the remaining family ties, speaking of their mutual love and the hope of reuniting with their lost sister in heaven. Despite Milly’s attempt to console him, John is gripped by a desperate fear of losing her too, exposing the vulnerability and rawness of his grief. His intense gaze and tender gestures toward Milly reveal his clinging to the hope and life she represents, even as he wrestles with the overwhelming tragedy.\n\nResolved to discover the truth about his daughter’s death, John Woodriff reveals he has taken concrete steps by contacting a private detective. He has sent a telegram to London to summon Paul Beck, a former schoolmate and reputedly one of the keenest detectives in London. Woodriff’s hope is that Beck might uncover details or evidence that eluded the coroner’s jury, and possibly explain the mysterious circumstances of Letitia’s poisoning. Milly questions the utility of such an investigation, fearing it will prolong their grief without bringing their daughter back, but John’s desire for answers is unshakable. His determination to understand “how death came to poor Letty” underscores his inner turmoil and need for closure.\n\nJohn asks about Susan, presumably another family member or close relation, who is revealed to be deeply distraught and physically affected by the tragedy. Susan had shared a close bond with Letitia, intensifying the sense of loss in the household. Milly is tasked with comforting Susan, while John, restless and anxious, decides to go out and await the arrival of the detective, walking down the road near their home to meet him.\n\nThe setting is then described in detail, situating the Woodriff family home in a red-brick house called Merview, perched on a wooded slope overlooking the sea. The location is three miles inland from the prosperous town of Deringham, where John Woodriff made his fortune in the iron industry. The imagery of the sea and the estate paints a picture of old wealth and relative comfort, contrasting with the current tragedy that has enveloped the household.\n\nAs Woodriff walks along the road, his encounter with Paul Beck is both sudden and somewhat incongruous. Beck arrives by hansom cab, appearing initially as a placid, unimpressive man, whom Woodriff somewhat dismisses as a commercial traveler. However, when Beck suddenly stops the cab and calls John's name, the recognition between the two old school friends is immediate and heartfelt. Beck expresses regret that their reunion should come under such sorrowful circumstances. It is revealed that Beck had received both John’s telegram and letter but was unable to attend the inquest due to being out of town.\n\nTheir first exchange is centered on the official verdict of accidental death, but Beck perceptively notes that John Woodriff’s demeanor suggests deeper disturbances than just grief; there is an unspoken fear lurking beneath his sorrow. This observation hints at hidden tensions or secrets yet to be uncovered. Beck’s intuition leads him to suggest they move somewhere more private and informal for a thorough conversation, as he prefers the freedom of walking without walls confining the discussion. This invitation signals the beginning of the detective’s involvement and investigation into Letitia’s mysterious death.\n\nIn summary, the opening segment establishes a somber and suspenseful tone for the story. It presents the Woodriff family devastated by Letitia’s untimely death under mysterious circumstances, with a coroner’s verdict that fails to explain how the poisoning occurred. John Woodriff’s profound grief and desperation to find answers drive him to enlist the help of Paul Beck, an experienced detective and old friend. The detailed portrayal of Woodriff’s sorrow, the family dynamics, and the atmospheric setting provide a rich emotional and narrative foundation. The arrival of Paul Beck sets the stage for a deeper inquiry into the tragic event, promising an investigation that may unravel the unknown elements surrounding “The Poisoner.”"

      "chunk_text": "They walked on together for a few moments without a word, till they came to a by-path on the left hand that led straight to the sea. They turned off the higher road, still without speaking. Mr. Woodriff’s face was haggard and perplexed and his eyes on the ground, and Mr. Beck glanced at him now and again as if striving to read his thoughts. The by-road took them out on a broad stretch of smooth strand. Beyond this to the sky-line the sea lay sparkling, and the long, clear ripples split themselves on the sand, foaming softly like champagne. At their back the cliffs rose in a black wall.\n“What is it?” asked Mr. Beck abruptly, as they walked close to the sea’s margin.\n“I’m afraid.”\n“Afraid of what?”\n“I don’t know of what or of whom, but I’m in deadly terror that my daughter Milly—my only daughter now—may be taken from me. Letty is not the first that has been poisoned. I dread she may not be the last.” He was trembling all over.\nMr. Beck took his arm. “Jack,” he said quietly, “if I can help you, I will, for old times’ sake, if for nothing else. Things may seem blacker to you than they really are. Tell me straight out what you know and what you fear.”\n“It’s a long story, Paul.”\nIt was curious how naturally the old schoolfellows dropped into the tone and names of a quarter of a century ago.\n“I’m in no hurry. Tell it your own way, but tell the whole of it.”\n“Only a year ago my eldest daughter Barbara died suddenly at school in the south of Germany. The telegram announcing her death miscarried, and she was buried before I arrived. The doctor said it was heart disease. I didn’t doubt it at the time; I had no reason to doubt it. But now I’m sure she was poisoned with morphia, as poor Letty was poisoned. It happened just the same way. Babs had been quite well all the morning, and breakfasted with the other girls. After breakfast she went to her room to read her letters from home. An hour later they found her lying back, huddled up in an easy-chair. They thought her sleeping, but she was dead.”\n“Your daughter Letty died in the same way?”\n“Precisely. Her twin-sister, Milly, and her cousin, Susan Coolin, who is on a visit with us, were at a young peoples’ party at the other side of the town, and stayed overnight. Letty insisted on remaining at home with me. We breakfasted together, and she was full of life and spirits. She was expecting a letter from an old schoolfellow, and she walked into town to meet the postman. We were together as far as the turn to the sea. I went out for a few hours’ mackerel fishing. She kept the road towards the town. Twenty yards away she turned smilingly to kiss hands to me as I passed the corner. I never saw her alive again.\n“When I returned the house was in an uproar of alarm and grief. The girls had just returned, and found Letty lying half across her bed, as if she had fallen on it, dead. At the inquest morphia poison was proved. She must have taken nearly ten grains of pure morphia the doctor declared—enough to cause death in less than half an hour.”\n“Had your daughters any love affairs?”\n“None that I ever heard of. They are very young—poor Letty wasn’t eighteen; a perfect schoolgirl. Did I tell you that she and Milly were twins? Babs was about the same age when she died—when she was poisoned in Germany.”\n“They were cheery girls, you say?”\n“As gay as larks. You may put suicide out of your head, if that is what you are thinking of.”\n“Suicide and accident dismissed; then we come to murder. Who were in the house when your daughter Letty was poisoned?”\n“Family servants, every man and woman of them. I’d as soon think of suspecting myself. Besides, there was no motive, and they all loved her.”\nSomething in the way the word “motive” was said caught Mr. Beck’s quick ear.\nHe turned round and faced John Woodriff there on the lonely sand, breaking off their walk abruptly.\n“What are you hiding from me, Jack? What motive do you know for this crime?”\n“I know of none.”\n“What do you guess, then? Come, be frank if I am to help you.”\n“The very thought is so preposterous—so horrible—that I don’t like even to put it in words. Besides, it is impossible.”\n“Let me judge of that. By clearing the impossibles out of the way we come to the possibles.”\n“I must go back a bit, then, to explain. You may remember we Woodriffs were five in family; four brothers and a sister. The eldest, Robert, became a doctor and settled down in Liverpool. He put his only son, Coleman Woodriff, to the same profession, and left him his practice—not a very good one, by all accounts—when he died. My second brother, Peter, has been in Chicago for thirty years, a bachelor, doing well and promising every year to pay us a visit. But he has nothing to do with what I have to say to you. The two youngest were myself and Dick. Dick always hated Robert like poison, but he and I were the best of friends till, as ill-luck would have it, we fell in love with the same girl. We fought our battle out fairly, like brothers, for her love, and I won! Poor Alice! No man ever had a better wife, but she died after the twins were born. I loved the little ones the dearer for her sake. Dick never got over his grief. He didn’t quarrel with me—he was too decent a chap for that—but he threw up his business; he was doing well as a stockbroker in Liverpool, and went to Australia, and stayed there till he died about three years ago. He speculated recklessly in land and building lots. But everything turned up trumps for him—crossed in love, you know the proverb—and he made a big pile.\n“He and I were good friends to the very last. He wrote every other post. He was very fond of the girls—for Alice’s sake, I think, as much as mine—constantly sent them handsome presents, and when he died he left them every farthing he had in the world, close on a quarter of a million.”\n“Share and share alike?”\n“Share and share alike, or to the survivors or survivor after they reached the age of eighteen years.”\nMr. Beck whistled under his breath. “If none reached the age of eighteen?” he asked, after a pause.\n“There was no provision in the will for that. I suppose poor Dick never thought of that. But I have consulted a lawyer about it. He tells me that if my three daughters should die under eighteen there is an ‘intestacy,’ and as the property is what he calls ‘real,’ that is houses and lands, it all goes to Dr. Coleman Woodriff, as heir-at-law to the deceased.”",

Babs was about the same age when she died—when she was poisoned in Germany.”\n“They were cheery girls, you say?”\n“As gay as larks. You may put suicide out of your head, if that is what you are thinking of.”\n“Suicide and accident dismissed; then we come to murder. Who were in the house when your daughter Letty was poisoned?”\n“Family servants, every man and woman of them. I’d as soon think of suspecting myself. Besides, there was no motive, and they all loved her.”\nSomething in the way the word “motive” was said caught Mr. Beck’s quick ear.\nHe turned round and faced John Woodriff there on the lonely sand, breaking off their walk abruptly.\n“What are you hiding from me, Jack? What motive do you know for this crime?”\n“I know of none.”\n“What do you guess, then? Come, be frank if I am to help you.”\n“The very thought is so preposterous—so horrible—that I don’t like even to put it in words. Besides, it is impossible.”\n“Let me judge of that. By clearing the impossibles out of the way we come to the possibles.”\n“I must go back a bit, then, to explain. You may remember we Woodriffs were five in family; four brothers and a sister. The eldest, Robert, became a doctor and settled down in Liverpool. He put his only son, Coleman Woodriff, to the same profession, and left him his practice—not a very good one, by all accounts—when he died. My second brother, Peter, has been in Chicago for thirty years, a bachelor, doing well and promising every year to pay us a visit. But he has nothing to do with what I have to say to you. The two youngest were myself and Dick. Dick always hated Robert like poison, but he and I were the best of friends till, as ill-luck would have it, we fell in love with the same girl. We fought our battle out fairly, like brothers, for her love, and I won! Poor Alice! No man ever had a better wife, but she died after the twins were born. I loved the little ones the dearer for her sake. Dick never got over his grief. He didn’t quarrel with me—he was too decent a chap for that—but he threw up his business; he was doing well as a stockbroker in Liverpool, and went to Australia, and stayed there till he died about three years ago. He speculated recklessly in land and building lots. But everything turned up trumps for him—crossed in love, you know the proverb—and he made a big pile.\n“He and I were good friends to the very last. He wrote every other post. He was very fond of the girls—for Alice’s sake, I think, as much as mine—constantly sent them handsome presents, and when he died he left them every farthing he had in the world, close on a quarter of a million.”\n“Share and share alike?”\n“Share and share alike, or to the survivors or survivor after they reached the age of eighteen years.”\nMr. Beck whistled under his breath. “If none reached the age of eighteen?” he asked, after a pause.\n“There was no provision in the will for that. I suppose poor Dick never thought of that. But I have consulted a lawyer about it. He tells me that if my three daughters should die under eighteen there is an ‘intestacy,’ and as the property is what he calls ‘real,’ that is houses and lands, it all goes to Dr. Coleman Woodriff, as heir-at-law to the deceased.”\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "“The Poisoner” is a detective story that opens with the tragic death of Letitia Woodriff, who was fatally poisoned by morphia under mysterious circumstances. The coroner’s inquest concludes that her death was accidental, but how the poison reached her remains an unsolved puzzle. The verdict leaves Letitia’s family and community in deep sorrow and confusion. Letitia’s father, John Woodriff, is stricken with grief, overcome by the loss of his daughter, and suffers from a profound mixture of love, despair, and bewilderment over the unanswered questions surrounding her death. His younger daughter, Milly, tries to comfort him, encouraging him to stay hopeful for the family’s future despite the tragedy.\n\nJohn’s grief is complicated by suspicion and fear. He contacts Paul Beck, a private detective and an old schoolfriend reputed for his sharp intellect in uncovering mysteries, requesting Beck’s help in finding the truth behind Letitia’s poisoning. Beck arrives at the Woodriff family estate, Merview, a spacious red-brick house perched above the sea near the prosperous town of Deringham, framing the story against a backdrop of old wealth shadowed by tragedy.\n\nUpon meeting Beck, John and the detective take a walk along a secluded by-path leading to the sea, a setting that balances quiet natural beauty with the dark weight of the situation. It is here that John confesses the deeper anxieties driving his quest for answers. He admits he is gripped by a “deadly terror” not only for the loss of Letitia but also for the safety of Milly, his only remaining daughter—the fear that she might be next to fall victim to poisoning. This reveals that Letitia’s death may not be an isolated incident.\n\nJohn recounts another family tragedy cast in a new light: his eldest daughter Barbara’s sudden death just a year earlier at a boarding school in southern Germany. While medically attributed to heart disease at that time, John now suspects Barbara was also poisoned with morphia, presenting a chilling pattern. Both daughters died suddenly and unexpectedly after breakfast, showed no prior signs of illness, and were found dead within a short time without an obvious cause. The similarity in circumstances draws a stark connection between the deaths and heightens the mystery.\n\nJohn vividly describes Letitia’s last day—how she chose to stay home instead of attending a young people’s party with Milly and their cousin Susan Coolin, who was visiting. Letitia was lively and full of anticipation, expecting a letter from an old schoolfriend. John details the tender moment when they last saw each other alive, letting the intimate scene underscore the shock and senselessness of her death. The inquest confirmed Letitia ingested an enormous dose of morphia, enough to kill her within minutes.\n\nPaul Beck’s analysis quickly narrows the possibilities. They dismiss suicide, as the girls were young and happy, and also do not accept accident or self-poisoning. That leaves murder as the most plausible explanation, but Beck probes John to construct the scenario logically: who had motive and opportunity?\n\nJohn asserts that suspicion of the family servants is unfounded—they all loved Letitia and there was no motive for harming her. Beck seizes on the word “motive” and presses John to disclose if there are any hidden motives or reasons that might point to a culprit. John hesitates but then shares crucial family history that begins to illuminate possible motives.\n\nThe Woodriff family consists of five siblings: four brothers and a sister. The eldest, Robert Woodriff, was a Liverpool doctor. His son, Coleman Woodriff, inherited his medical practice but is not regarded as particularly successful. Another brother, Peter, has lived abroad in Chicago for decades and is uninvolved in current events. The two youngest brothers, John (the narrator) and Dick, were close until a love rivalry fractured their relationship. Both were enamored with the same woman, Alice, whom John ultimately married. Alice died after the birth of the twins, Letitia and Milly, deepening John’s protective love for them.\n\nDick Woodriff left England and spent his final years prospering in Australia’s speculative land market, despite his earlier personal heartbreak. He remained on good terms with John and was fond of the children, often sending them generous presents. Upon Dick’s recent death, he left a substantial inheritance—worth nearly a quarter of a million pounds—to John’s three daughters, to be divided equally or inherited by survivors after they turned eighteen.\n\nHowever, John reveals a critical legal loophole: if all three daughters were to die before reaching eighteen, no provision in the will covers what happens to the estate. In that eventuality, the properties and assets, classified as “real property,” would default by intestacy laws to Dr. Coleman Woodriff — the son of the eldest brother — who is next in line as heir-at-law.\n\nThis revelation raises the stakes considerably. The fate of the entire estate hinges on the survival of these young girls. It paints a potential motive for murder that is overshadowed by the prospect of inheritance, secret family dynamics, and unresolved resentments. Beck, attentive and thoughtful, whistled softly in recognition of how the law and family bonds might entangle with darker human motives.\n\nThus, the story deepens beyond a mere tragic accident into a tangled web of family history, inheritance disputes, and the specter of deliberate poisoning. The innocence of the girls, the sorrow of the father, and the duty of the detective intertwine, setting the stage for a complex investigation.\n\nIn summation, the narrative so far blends poignant grief with mounting suspicion. John Woodriff’s personal tragedy is compounded by the striking similarities between Letitia’s and Barbara’s sudden deaths, prompting him to seek the assistance of Paul Beck. The detective’s arrival marks the beginning of an intense inquiry driven by fear for the surviving daughter, legal complexities regarding inheritance, and the search for a hidden motive behind the mysterious poisoning deaths. The story’s setting, family background, and emergent secrets create a compelling atmosphere ripe for unveiling “The Poisoner.”"

      "chunk_text": "“Here’s our motive, anyway,” said Mr. Beck, “clear enough and strong enough.”\n“But the thing is preposterous,” protested Mr. Woodriff earnestly, “admitting that the man, my brother’s son, could be such a devil, and I won’t and don’t admit it! Still he could have no hand in this. He was in Liverpool when Babs was poisoned in Germany; he was in Liverpool when Letty was poisoned here.”\n“What kind of a fellow is this Dr. Coleman Woodriff?” persisted Mr. Beck.\n“A very decent fellow, by all accounts, and clever, too; though he has been always pulling the devil by the tail. I haven’t seen much of him, but I liked what I saw. My sister and his aunt, Mrs. Coolin, who is a widow, and lives in Liverpool, knows him well, and likes him greatly. It’s her only daughter, Susan, that I told you is staying with us.”\n“What does Susan think of Dr. Coleman?”\n“Well, she doesn’t like him—that’s a fact. But it’s only a young girl’s whim. She’s a quiet, shy little body, two years older than Milly, but you’d think she was three years younger—she’s like a child in the ways of the world. In spite of her unreasoning dislike of Dr. Coleman, she has nothing but what is good to say of him. Believe me, Paul, if you want to get to the bottom of this thing, you’d best leave him out of your head.”\n“Humph!” was Mr. Beck’s sole comment on this appeal, and there was a long lapse into silence.\n“Did your daughter Letty get the letter she was expecting?” he asked presently.\n“I cannot say. There was a fire in her room, and we found the ashes of some papers in the grate.”\n“No trace of poison found anywhere?”\n“None. The servants swore that she tasted nothing after her return. I have had her room locked since she died, hoping you would come.”\nIt was only by a palpable effort that the man forced himself to answer Mr. Beck’s questions calmly and clearly, keeping down by a strong effort the grief and fear that tortured him. Mr. Beck walked on in silence, with a face as blank as a gravestone, and the other watched him with eyes of helpless, piteous appeal, like a dog’s.\nIn a moment or two John Woodriff’s impatience mastered him.\n“For God’s sake, speak, man!” he broke out.\n“I have nothing to say worth saying,” Mr. Beck answered quietly.\n“You believe there has been foul play. You think Milly is in danger?”\n“I fear so.”\nThe self-restraint of the father snapped suddenly, and his grief and fear broke loose.\n“You will help me to save her, Paul, my poor little girl—my last? God pity me! For the sake of old times, you will help me to save her?”\nA look of deep sympathy came to Mr. Beck’s face, transforming it for a moment. For answer he gripped his old schoolmate’s hand.\n“Steady, Jack!” he said. “You will need all your nerve before this business is through. How old is your daughter Milly?”\n“She wants barely a month of eighteen.”\n“That shortens the job. This elder brother in Chicago—Peter, I think you said—can we have him back at once?”\nJohn Woodriff stared at him as if he had gone suddenly mad.\n“I mean, can I be your eldest brother and live with you for a month or so without arousing suspicion?”\n“Oh, certainly! No one here knows him, and everybody knows that I have been expecting him.”\n“That’s settled then. The day after to-morrow your eldest brother Peter will turn up unexpectedly from Chicago. But, mind, the secret is between us two. Not a word to a single soul.”\n“Not even to Milly or Susan?\n“Most certainly not! I must be Peter Woodriff to every one but you. Now there is one thing more. I want to have a look at the room where your daughter died before I go back to town.”\nBut Mr. Woodriff objected shrewdly. “If you are coming back as Peter, best not show yourself at all now.”\n“Does any one know that Mr. Beck, the detective, was expected?”\n“No one except my daughter Milly.”",

      "summary": "“The Poisoner” unfolds as a gripping detective story centered on the tragic and mysterious deaths of John Woodriff’s two daughters, Letitia (Letty) and Barbara, both victims of sudden and unexplained morphia poisoning. The narrative intertwines deep familial sorrow with an encroaching suspicion that these deaths may not have been accidental, but the result of deliberate foul play tied to complex family relationships and inheritance schemes.\n\nAt the story’s heart is John Woodriff, a father shattered by grief yet consumed by a desperate need to protect his last surviving daughter, Milly. Initially accepting the coroner’s accidental death verdict in Letitia’s case, John’s perspective shifts as he recalls the eerily similar circumstances surrounding Barbara’s unexpected demise the previous year. Both daughters died after breakfast, showing no apparent illness, their deaths swift and without clear explanation. This haunting pattern fuels John’s fears that Milly’s life is in jeopardy.\n\nSeeking clarity and justice, John calls upon an old schoolfriend and private detective, Paul Beck, known for his astute analytical mind and calm demeanor. Beck’s arrival at the Woodriff family estate, Merview, marks the beginning of a meticulous and emotionally charged investigation. John, battling despair, confides in Beck the depth of his fears and reveals troubling family dynamics that could hold the key to the mystery.\n\nCentral to the intrigue is the Woodriff family tree and its intricate inheritance arrangements. John’s brother Dick, recently deceased, left a considerable fortune to John’s three daughters, to be divided among survivors reaching adulthood. However, a critical legal caveat looms: if all three daughters were to die before turning eighteen, the estate would revert by intestacy laws to their cousin, Dr. Coleman Woodriff—son of Robert, the eldest Woodriff brother and a Liverpool doctor. This loophole casts a sinister shadow, presenting a potent motive tied to vast wealth and property, and raising the chilling possibility that someone might wish to hasten the girls' deaths for personal gain.\n\nDespite this, John adamantly defends Dr. Coleman’s character, describing him as decent and clever, albeit occasionally mischievous. Interestingly, Susan Coolin, John’s niece and Dr. Coleman’s cousin, harbors an inexplicable dislike toward Coleman despite recognizing his good qualities. Susan’s aversion is portrayed as an innocent “young girl’s whim,” but it adds an undercurrent of tension and suspicion within the household.\n\nAs Beck probes deeper, John reveals that Letitia was expecting a letter from an old schoolfriend on the day she died, but this letter’s fate remains a mystery. Letty’s room had a fire in the grate where ashes of some papers were found, yet no traces of poison were uncovered anywhere else in the house. The servants maintain there was no indication Letitia ingested any food or drink upon returning home that day. To preserve evidence, John had kept Letty’s room locked since her passing, anticipating Beck’s arrival.\n\nThroughout their conversations, Beck remains contemplative and somber, revealing little and maintaining a façade of stoicism that contrasts sharply with John’s mounting desperation. When pressed about his beliefs, Beck confirms his fear that there has indeed been foul play and that Milly’s life is at risk. This admission shatters John’s restraint; his grief erupts as he pleads for Beck’s help to save his surviving daughter.\n\nIn response, Beck formulates a subtle and secretive plan aimed at safeguarding Milly while continuing the investigation. He proposes that John’s eldest brother, Peter—who resides in Chicago and has not been involved in the recent family affairs—return anonymously to Merview. Beck suggests Peter visit under John’s guise as “Peter Woodriff,” explaining that no one at the estate knows the real Peter personally but are aware of his expected arrival. This tactic would provide an internal protective presence without alerting potential perpetrators.\n\nJohn is initially stunned by the audacity of Beck’s suggestion but recognizes its necessity. The secrecy is imperative; not even Milly or Susan are to be informed of the detective’s involvement or Peter’s assumed identity, ensuring the element of surprise. Beck emphasizes that the matter must be handled with utmost discretion and that nerves must be steel—Milly’s eighteenth birthday is less than a month away, limiting the time to prevent further tragedy.\n\nBefore departing back to London to arrange these plans, Beck expresses the desire to inspect Letitia’s room personally despite John’s objections, who notes that exposing Beck now might impede his undercover return as Peter. This tension underscores the delicate balance between gathering evidence and maintaining the ruse.\n\nThis segment deepens the story’s psychological complexity and narrative tension. The moral certainty of John, a grieving father, conflicts with the calculated and guarded approach of Beck the detective. The interplay highlights how grief, fear, and suspicion can fracture familial bonds and complicate the search for truth. The inheritance motive introduces a classic theme of avarice entwined with tragedy, while Beck’s strategy of subterfuge indicates a mystery that demands not only intellect but strategic cunning.\n\nThe setting—the formidable Woodriff estate perched over the sea—continues to loom ominously, symbolizing both the heritage at stake and the isolation enveloping the family. Supporting characters such as Susan Coolin add layers of interpersonal dynamics, hinting that not all family tensions are openly acknowledged.\n\nIn summation, “The Poisoner” narrates a haunting investigation into the sudden poisoning of two young women, blending legal intrigue, psychological drama, and detective craft. The narrative balances the tender portrayals of familial loss with the meticulous unravelling of a potentially sinister plot. With time running against them, Paul Beck and John Woodriff prepare to confront hidden dangers and unmask the poisoner before Milly joins her sisters in tragedy. The stage is set for a climactic resolution as suspicion, motive, and desperation collide in this poignant and suspenseful tale."

      "chunk_text": "“I think I had best put in an appearance,” said Mr. Beck. “It’s no harm that I should have a look round with two pair of eyes—Mr. Paul Beck’s and Mr. Peter Woodriff’s. I don’t think the young ladies—or any one else for that matter—are likely to recognise me on my next visit. By the way, what is brother Peter like?”\n“Like me they say, only taller.”\nWhen they got to the house they found Milly Woodriff shy and frightened of the London detective. It was meek-eyed Susan Coolin that saw to his comfort, sat with him at lunch, and showed him to the room where her dead cousin still lay.\n“If I can help you in any way, Mr. Beck, please tell me,” she said, looking wistfully in his face with guileless blue eyes. “I was very fond of poor Letty.”\n“I’m sure of that, my poor child,” he said gently. “But I do my work best alone.”\nHe locked the room door on the inside, and began his search at once. Nothing escaped his quick eyes and hands. Finally he swept all the dust into a corner and examined it carefully, and then sifted the ashes in the grate through his fingers. In the ashes he found a blob of blue glass, melted to a long needle at one end, and a fragment, half burned, of a white pasteboard box. In the dust sweepings there was a little twisted gold ring of antique make and small value, a strip of narrow white ribbon notched like the edges of a saw; a tangle of bright-coloured silk threads, and innumerable pins and hairpins.\nHe showed his treasures in the palm of his big hand to John Woodriff just before he started.\n“I have a notion,” he said, “that there are one or two letters of our riddle here, if I can only manage to pick them out of the rubbish.”\n* * *\nTwo days later a tall, loose-limbed man, with unmistakable suggestions of the Yankee in voice, dress, and figure, inquired at Merview for Mr. John Woodriff.\nFor a moment Mr. Woodriff was puzzled. But when the stranger said in a quiet drawl, slightly flavoured with a nasal twang: “Reckon, John, you don’t know your own brother Peter who has come away round the big ball for a squint at you,” Mr. Woodriff grasped his hand heartily, and welcomed Mr. Beck with unaffected cordiality.\nIt was a marvellous make-up. Peter Woodriff, of Chicago, was a very tall man—nearly three inches taller than Mr. Beck, whom he in no way resembled. About the lines of eyes and mouth there was a strong family resemblance to Mr. John Woodriff, which people noticed immediately, declaring they could tell them to be brothers at first sight.\nThe two girls were called down to welcome their uncle Peter and took to him at once. He was so shrewd and yet so kindly-hearted; so grieved at their grief when he came to know of it, that he won his way straight to their hearts.\nDay by day they grew to be better friends. But though he plainly loved them both, Susan Coolin seemed his favourite. The dead load of grief for her twin-sister who was part of herself still lay heavy on the heart of the once gay and frolicsome Milly Woodriff. Now and again for a few happy moments her grief would be forgotten and the bright black eyes would sparkle with their former light, and she would answer her uncle’s quaint jests with saucy liveliness. Now and again a gay verse would start from her lips, spontaneous as the wild bird’s song. But it was only for a moment; the next the sparkle of her eyes would be quenched and the music of her voice hushed by the sad insistent memory of her sorrow.\nBut Susan was of a more placid mood. Grief itself could not ruffle the even gentleness of her nature. They were a curious contrast; the big, rough, shrewd man and the quiet, innocent little maid.

      "prompt": "Continue summarizing Detective story 'The Poisoner' by Unknown. This is part 4 of 4 segments. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-3):\n“The Poisoner” unfolds as a gripping detective story centered on the tragic and mysterious deaths of John Woodriff’s two daughters, Letitia (Letty) and Barbara, both victims of sudden and unexplained morphia poisoning. The narrative intertwines deep familial sorrow with an encroaching suspicion that these deaths may not have been accidental, but the result of deliberate foul play tied to complex family relationships and inheritance schemes.\n\nAt the story’s heart is John Woodriff, a father shattered by grief yet consumed by a desperate need to protect his last surviving daughter, Milly. Initially accepting the coroner’s accidental death verdict in Letitia’s case, John’s perspective shifts as he recalls the eerily similar circumstances surrounding Barbara’s unexpected demise the previous year. Both daughters died after breakfast, showing no apparent illness, their deaths swift and without clear explanation. This haunting pattern fuels John’s fears that Milly’s life is in jeopardy.\n\nSeeking clarity and justice, John calls upon an old schoolfriend and private detective, Paul Beck, known for his astute analytical mind and calm demeanor. Beck’s arrival at the Woodriff family estate, Merview, marks the beginning of a meticulous and emotionally charged investigation. John, battling despair, confides in Beck the depth of his fears and reveals troubling family dynamics that could hold the key to the mystery.\n\nCentral to the intrigue is the Woodriff family tree and its intricate inheritance arrangements. John’s brother Dick, recently deceased, left a considerable fortune to John’s three daughters, to be divided among survivors reaching adulthood. However, a critical legal caveat looms: if all three daughters were to die before turning eighteen, the estate would revert by intestacy laws to their cousin, Dr. Coleman Woodriff—son of Robert, the eldest Woodriff brother and a Liverpool doctor. This loophole casts a sinister shadow, presenting a potent motive tied to vast wealth and property, and raising the chilling possibility that someone might wish to hasten the girls' deaths for personal gain.\n\nDespite this, John adamantly defends Dr. Coleman’s character, describing him as decent and clever, albeit occasionally mischievous. Interestingly, Susan Coolin, John’s niece and Dr. Coleman’s cousin, harbors an inexplicable dislike toward Coleman despite recognizing his good qualities. Susan’s aversion is portrayed as an innocent “young girl’s whim,” but it adds an undercurrent of tension and suspicion within the household.\n\nAs Beck probes deeper, John reveals that Letitia was expecting a letter from an old schoolfriend on the day she died, but this letter’s fate remains a mystery. Letty’s room had a fire in the grate where ashes of some papers were found, yet no traces of poison were uncovered anywhere else in the house. The servants maintain there was no indication Letitia ingested any food or drink upon returning home that day. To preserve evidence, John had kept Letty’s room locked since her passing, anticipating Beck’s arrival.\n\nThroughout their conversations, Beck remains contemplative and somber, revealing little and maintaining a façade of stoicism that contrasts sharply with John’s mounting desperation. When pressed about his beliefs, Beck confirms his fear that there has indeed been foul play and that Milly’s life is at risk. This admission shatters John’s restraint; his grief erupts as he pleads for Beck’s help to save his surviving daughter.\n\nIn response, Beck formulates a subtle and secretive plan aimed at safeguarding Milly while continuing the investigation. He proposes that John’s eldest brother, Peter—who resides in Chicago and has not been involved in the recent family affairs—return anonymously to Merview. Beck suggests Peter visit under John’s guise as “Peter Woodriff,” explaining that no one at the estate knows the real Peter personally but are aware of his expected arrival. This tactic would provide an internal protective presence without alerting potential perpetrators.\n\nJohn is initially stunned by the audacity of Beck’s suggestion but recognizes its necessity. The secrecy is imperative; not even Milly or Susan are to be informed of the detective’s involvement or Peter’s assumed identity, ensuring the element of surprise. Beck emphasizes that the matter must be handled with utmost discretion and that nerves must be steel—Milly’s eighteenth birthday is less than a month away, limiting the time to prevent further tragedy.\n\nBefore departing back to London to arrange these plans, Beck expresses the desire to inspect Letitia’s room personally despite John’s objections, who notes that exposing Beck now might impede his undercover return as Peter. This tension underscores the delicate balance between gathering evidence and maintaining the ruse.\n\nThis segment deepens the story’s psychological complexity and narrative tension. The moral certainty of John, a grieving father, conflicts with the calculated and guarded approach of Beck the detective. The interplay highlights how grief, fear, and suspicion can fracture familial bonds and complicate the search for truth. The inheritance motive introduces a classic theme of avarice entwined with tragedy, while Beck’s strategy of subterfuge indicates a mystery that demands not only intellect but strategic cunning.\n\nThe setting—the formidable Woodriff estate perched over the sea—continues to loom ominously, symbolizing both the heritage at stake and the isolation enveloping the family. Supporting characters such as Susan Coolin add layers of interpersonal dynamics, hinting that not all family tensions are openly acknowledged.\n\nIn summation, “The Poisoner” narrates a haunting investigation into the sudden poisoning of two young women, blending legal intrigue, psychological drama, and detective craft. The narrative balances the tender portrayals of familial loss with the meticulous unravelling of a potentially sinister plot. With time running against them, Paul Beck and John Woodriff prepare to confront hidden dangers and unmask the poisoner before Milly joins her sisters in tragedy. The stage is set for a climactic resolution as suspicion, motive, and desperation collide in this poignant and suspenseful tale.\n\nCurrent segment (part 4):\n“I think I had best put in an appearance,” said Mr. Beck. “It’s no harm that I should have a look round with two pair of eyes—Mr. Paul Beck’s and Mr. Peter Woodriff’s. I don’t think the young ladies—or any one else for that matter—are likely to recognise me on my next visit. By the way, what is brother Peter like?”\n“Like me they say, only taller.”\nWhen they got to the house they found Milly Woodriff shy and frightened of the London detective. It was meek-eyed Susan Coolin that saw to his comfort, sat with him at lunch, and showed him to the room where her dead cousin still lay.\n“If I can help you in any way, Mr. Beck, please tell me,” she said, looking wistfully in his face with guileless blue eyes. “I was very fond of poor Letty.”\n“I’m sure of that, my poor child,” he said gently. “But I do my work best alone.”\nHe locked the room door on the inside, and began his search at once. Nothing escaped his quick eyes and hands. Finally he swept all the dust into a corner and examined it carefully, and then sifted the ashes in the grate through his fingers. In the ashes he found a blob of blue glass, melted to a long needle at one end, and a fragment, half burned, of a white pasteboard box. In the dust sweepings there was a little twisted gold ring of antique make and small value, a strip of narrow white ribbon notched like the edges of a saw; a tangle of bright-coloured silk threads, and innumerable pins and hairpins.\nHe showed his treasures in the palm of his big hand to John Woodriff just before he started.\n“I have a notion,” he said, “that there are one or two letters of our riddle here, if I can only manage to pick them out of the rubbish.”\n* * *\nTwo days later a tall, loose-limbed man, with unmistakable suggestions of the Yankee in voice, dress, and figure, inquired at Merview for Mr. John Woodriff.\nFor a moment Mr. Woodriff was puzzled. But when the stranger said in a quiet drawl, slightly flavoured with a nasal twang: “Reckon, John, you don’t know your own brother Peter who has come away round the big ball for a squint at you,” Mr. Woodriff grasped his hand heartily, and welcomed Mr. Beck with unaffected cordiality.\nIt was a marvellous make-up. Peter Woodriff, of Chicago, was a very tall man—nearly three inches taller than Mr. Beck, whom he in no way resembled. About the lines of eyes and mouth there was a strong family resemblance to Mr. John Woodriff, which people noticed immediately, declaring they could tell them to be brothers at first sight.\nThe two girls were called down to welcome their uncle Peter and took to him at once. He was so shrewd and yet so kindly-hearted; so grieved at their grief when he came to know of it, that he won his way straight to their hearts.\nDay by day they grew to be better friends. But though he plainly loved them both, Susan Coolin seemed his favourite. The dead load of grief for her twin-sister who was part of herself still lay heavy on the heart of the once gay and frolicsome Milly Woodriff. Now and again for a few happy moments her grief would be forgotten and the bright black eyes would sparkle with their former light, and she would answer her uncle’s quaint jests with saucy liveliness. Now and again a gay verse would start from her lips, spontaneous as the wild bird’s song. But it was only for a moment; the next the sparkle of her eyes would be quenched and the music of her voice hushed by the sad insistent memory of her sorrow.\nBut Susan was of a more placid mood. Grief itself could not ruffle the even gentleness of her nature. They were a curious contrast; the big, rough, shrewd man and the quiet, innocent little maid. But the contrast seemed to have its charm for both.\nPeter Woodriff passed at once into the inner circle of their home-life. So perfect was the charm of his identity that John Woodriff, who was not good at make-belief, often found himself, quite naturally, speaking to him, and even thinking of him, as his brother.\nTo Susan, Peter Woodriff was the kindest of uncles, and she repaid his affection with little innocent confidences concerning her home-life in Liverpool, in which he seemed deeply interested.

      "summary": "“The Poisoner” is a compelling detective narrative revolving around the mysterious and tragic deaths of two sisters, Letitia and Barbara Woodriff, both fatally poisoned by morphia under suspicious circumstances. The story centers on John Woodriff, their grieving father, who is determined to protect his surviving daughter, Milly, from meeting the same grim fate. Initial assumptions of accidental poisoning are challenged as John recalls the eerie similarity in the deaths and the early loss of the other daughter, Barbara. Suspecting foul play linked to complicated family dynamics and a lucrative inheritance, John enlists the help of a private detective, Paul Beck, an old schoolfriend with a sharp mind and methodical approach.\n\nThe family’s inheritance arrangement lies at the story’s core: the substantial fortune passed down from John’s late brother Dick is designated to John’s three daughters. However, a critical clause states that if all three died before reaching eighteen, the estate would revert to their cousin Dr. Coleman Woodriff—son of the eldest Woodriff brother, Robert.

Milly, shy and frightened of the outsider, contrasts with the gentle and caring Susan, who assists Beck and earns his quiet appreciation. Beck’s investigative sharpness quickly identifies a few intriguing artifacts in Letitia’s former room: a shard of blue glass melted into a fine needle, fragments of a white pasteboard box, an old-fashioned gold ring of minor value, a strip of rough-edged white ribbon, colorful silk threads, and assorted pins and hairpins. These finds pique Beck’s interest, convincing him that hidden clues, including letters that might unravel the riddle, are concealed within the ashes and room debris.\n\nHowever, Beck’s investigation requires a more covert approach to safeguard Milly. He devises a plan involving John’s eldest brother Peter, a tall, robust man from Chicago. Since no one at Merview has met Peter, Beck proposes that Peter return to the estate under his own identity, unknown to the household, adopting the guise of “Peter Woodriff.” This cover would provide discreet protection to Milly without arousing suspicion or compromising the investigation. John is initially taken aback by this strategic subterfuge but quickly sees its necessity, agreeing to the plan under strict secrecy—Milly and Susan must remain uninformed to preserve the element of surprise.\n\nTwo days later, Peter Woodriff makes his entrance at Merview, embodying a distinctive American demeanor with a drawl and a tall, imposing figure. Despite his different appearance from his brother John and cousin Paul Beck, his strong familial resemblance is undeniable. The two Woodriff sisters warmly receive him; his straightforward kindness and evident sorrow for their loss help him win their affection rapidly. While Milly occasionally fades beneath her grief, showing fleeting moments of her old vivacity, Susan’s gentler disposition and steady composure provide a stabilizing contrast. Peter naturally gravitates toward Susan, who becomes his favorite, and their bond strengthens through candid conversations. Susan opens her heart to Peter, sharing honest opinions about her home life in Liverpool and her unease with Dr. Coleman Woodriff. She admits Coleman’s advances frightened her, though she later expresses remorse, acknowledges his good nature with the less fortunate, and worries she may have unfairly influenced Peter’s impression of her cousin.\n\nLife at Merview begins settling into a more comfortable rhythm under Peter’s watchful presence. His involvement eases some of John’s vigilance, allowing the family to find small moments of normalcy as grief gradually dulls from acute agony. The girls adopt the simple routine of meeting the postman at a familiar red pillar box partway into town, often accompanied by their uncle Peter, who leisurely smokes cigars while they collect and share their mail. This domestic scene underscores the contrast between looming danger and the desire for ordinary comfort amid tragedy.\n\nOne October morning proves pivotal. Milly receives an unusually large postal delivery, including a wedge-shaped box of wedding cake sealed elegantly with pale blue wax and tied with the very narrow white ribbon edged like a saw—eerily reminiscent of the ribbon found among the ashes in Letitia’s room. Inside the box is a card inscribed with the bride’s name, “Louisa Thompson,” a name unfamiliar to Milly and Susan. The girls muse about the cake’s origin, assuming it could be from a distant acquaintance or friend of Louisa, and Milly generously offers half to Susan. As Susan carefully divides the cake on a sheet of notepaper, discards the box and wrappings into the fireplace, and extends the paper bearing the cake, Uncle Peter suddenly intervenes. With a calm, deliberate motion, he shifts the paper so that Milly reaches for Susan’s piece and vice versa.\n\nThis seemingly minor but significant act suggests Peter’s acute awareness and cautious protective instinct. Given the history of poisoning masked through innocuous means such as food gifts, Peter’s intervention warns of possible danger lurking within the cake itself. The narrow white ribbon on the box and the ashes in Letitia’s room connect sinister clues, reinforcing the theory that the deaths were not accidental but part of a crafty plot involving poison delivered through everyday objects.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the Woodriff estate looms as a gothic backdrop: grand and isolated, a symbol of legacy, sorrow, and the concealed menace threatening its inhabitants. The story deftly interweaves legal intrigue—anchored in complicated wills and inheritance laws—with complex emotional and interpersonal dynamics. Grief colors every interaction, from John’s anguish-stricken resolve to Milly’s fragile resilience and Susan’s quiet strength. Meanwhile, Beck’s professional detachment contrasts with the family’s emotional rawness, highlighting the challenging balance between empathy and investigative rigor in pursuit of truth.\n\nUltimately, “The Poisoner” is a masterfully crafted tale of mystery, suspense, and human vulnerability.
