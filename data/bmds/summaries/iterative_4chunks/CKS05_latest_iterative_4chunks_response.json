      "chunk_text": "\"DR. JAMES HANSON, Coroner's Physician, Criminal Courts Building,\" read Craig Kennedy, as he held a visitor's card in his hand. Then to the visitor he added, \"Take a chair, Doctor.\"\nThe physician thanked him and sat down. \"Professor Kennedy,\" he began, \"I have been referred to you by Inspector O'Connor of the Detective Bureau. It may seem an impertinence for a city official to call on you for assistance, but—well, you see, I'm completely floored. I think, too, that the case will interest you. It's the Vandam case.\"\nIf Dr. Hanson had suddenly turned on the current of an induction coil and I had been holding the handles I don't think the thrill I received could have been any more sudden. The Vandam case was the sensation of the moment, a triple puzzle, as both Kennedy and myself had agreed. Was it suicide, murder, or sudden death? Every theory, so far, had proved unsatisfactory.\n\"I have read only what the newspapers have published,\" replied Craig to the doctor's look of inquiry. \"You see, my friend Jameson here is on the staff of the Star, and we are in the habit of discussing these cases.\"\n\"Very glad to meet you, Mr. Jameson,\" exclaimed Dr. Hanson at the implied introduction. \"The relations between my office and your paper have always been very satisfactory, I can assure you.\"\n\"Thank you, Doctor. Depend on me to keep them so,\" I replied, shaking his proffered hand.\n\"Now, as to the case,\" continued the doctor slowly. \"Here is a beautiful woman in the prime of life, the wife of a very wealthy retired banker considerably older than herself—perhaps nearly seventy—of very fine family. Of course you have read it all, but let me sketch it so you will look at it from my point of view. This woman, apparently in good health, with every luxury money can buy, is certain within a very few years, from her dower rights, to be numbered among the richest women in America. Yet she is discovered in the middle of the night by her maid, seated at the table in the library of her home, unconscious. She never regains consciousness, but dies the following morning.\n\"The coroner is called in, and, as his physician, I must advise him. The family physician has pronounced it due to natural causes, the uremic coma of latent kidney trouble. Some of the newspapers, I think the Star among them, have hinted at suicide. And then there are others, who have flatly asserted it was murder.\"\nThe coroner's physician paused to see if we were following him. Needless to say Kennedy was ahead of him.\n\"Have you any facts in your possession which have not been given to the public yet?\" asked Craig.\n\"I'm coming to that in a moment,\" replied Dr. Hanson. \"Let me sketch the case first. Henry Vandam had become—well, very eccentric in his old age, we will say. Among his eccentricities none seems to have impressed the newspapers more than his devotion to a medium and her manager, Mrs. May Popper and Mr. Howard Farrington. Now, of course, the case does not go into the truth or falsity of spiritualism, you understand. You have your opinion, and I have mine. What this aspect of the case involves is merely the character of the medium and her manager. You know, of course, that Henry Vandam is completely under their control.\"\nHe paused again, to emphasise the point.\n\"You asked me if I was in possession of any facts which have not been given to the press. Yes, I am. And just there lies the trouble. They are so very conflicting as to be almost worse than useless, as far as I can see. We found near the unfortunate woman a small pill-box with three capsules still in it. It was labelled 'One before retiring' and bore the name of a certain druggist and the initials 'Dr. C.W.H.' Now, I am convinced that the initials are merely a blind and do not give any clue. The druggist says that a maid from the Vandam house brought in the prescription, which of course he filled. It is a harmless enough prescription—contains, among other things, four and a half grains of quinine and one-sixth of a grain of morphine. Six capsules were prepared altogether.\n\"Now, of course my first thought was that she might have taken several capsules at once and that it was a case of accidental morphine poisoning, or it might even be suicide. But it cannot be either, to my mind, for only three of the six capsules are gone. No doubt, also, you are acquainted with the fact that the one invariable symptom of morphine poisoning is the contraction of the pupils of the eyes to a pin-point—often so that they are unrecognisable. Moreover, the pupils are symmetrically contracted, and this symptom is the one invariably present in coma from morphine poisoning and distinguishes it from all other forms of death.\n\"On the other hand, in the coma of kidney disease one pupil is dilated and the other contracted—they are unsymmetrical. But in this case both the pupils are normal, or only a very little dilated, and they are symmetrical. So far we have been able to find no other poison than the slight traces of morphine remaining in the stomach after so many hours. I think you are enough of a chemist to know that no doctor would dare go on the stand and swear to death from morphine poisoning in the face of such evidence against him. The veriest tyro of an expert toxicologist could too easily confute him.\"\nKennedy nodded. \"Have you the pill-box and the prescription?\"\n\"I have,\" replied Dr. Hanson, placing them on the table.\nKennedy scrutinised them sharply. \"I shall need these,\" he said. \"Of course you understand I will take very good care of them. Is there anything else of importance?\"\n\"Really, I don't know,\" said the physician dubiously. \"It's rather out of my province, but perhaps you would think it important. It's mighty uncanny anyhow. Henry Vandam, as you doubtless know, was much more deeply interested in the work of this medium than was his wife. Perhaps Mrs. Vandam was a bit jealous—I don't know. But she, too, had an interest in spiritualism, though he was much more deeply influenced by Mrs. Popper than she.\n\"Here's the strange part of it. The old man believes so thoroughly in rappings and materialisations that he constantly keeps a notebook in his pocket in which he records all the materialisations he thinks he sees and the rappings he hears, along with the time and place. Now it so happened that on the night Mrs. Vandam was taken ill, he had retired—I believe in another part of the house, where he has a regular seance-room. According to his story, he was awakened from a profound sleep by a series of rappings. As was his custom, he noted the time at which they occurred. Something made him uneasy, and he said to his 'control'—at least this is his story:\n\"'John, is it about Mary?'\n\"Three raps answered 'yes,' the usual code.\n\"'What is the matter? Is she ill?'\n\"The three answering raps were so vigorous that he sprang out of bed and called for his wife's maid. The maid replied that Mrs. Vandam had not gone to bed yet, but that there was a light in the library and she would go to her mistress immediately. The next moment the house was awakened by the screams of the maid calling for help, that Mrs. Vandam was dying.\n\"That was three nights ago. On each of the two succeeding nights Henry Vandam says he has been awakened at precisely the same hour by a rapping, and on each night his 'control' has given him a message from his dead wife. As a man of science, I attribute the whole thing to an overwrought imagination. The original rappings may have been a mere coincidence with the fact of the condition of Mrs. Vandam. However, I give this to you for what it is worth.\"\n\nCRAIG said nothing, but, as was his habit, shaded his eyes with the tips of his fingers, resting his elbows on the arms of his chair: \"I suppose,\" he said, \"you can give me the necessary authority to enter the Vandam house and look at the scene of these happenings?\"\n\"Certainly,\" assented the physician, \"but you will find it a queer place. There are spirit paintings and spirit photographs in every room, and Vandam's own part of the house—well, it's creepy, that's all I can say.\"\n\"And also I suppose you have performed an autopsy on the body and will allow me to drop into your laboratory to-morrow morning and satisfy myself on this morphine point?\"\n\"Certainly,\" replied the coroner's physician, \"at any time you say.\"\n\"At ten sharp, then, to-morrow I shall be there,\" said Craig. \"It is now eight-thirty. Do you think I can see Vandam to-night? What time do these rappings occur?\"\n\"Why, yes, you surely will be able to see him to-night. He hasn't stirred from the house since his wife died. He told me he momentarily expected messages from her direct when she had got strong enough in her new world. I believe they had some kind of a compact to that effect. The rappings come at twelve-thirty.\"\n\"Ah, then I shall have plenty of time to run over to my laboratory before seeing Mr. Vandam and get some apparatus I have in mind. No, Doctor, you needn't bother to go with me. Just give me a card of introduction. I'll see you to-morrow at ten. Good- night—oh, by the way, don't give out any of the facts you have told me.\"\n\"Jameson,\" said Craig, when we were walking rapidly over toward the university, \"this promises to be an uncommonly difficult case.\"\n\"As I view it now,\" I said, \"I have suspicions of everybody concerned in it. Even the view of the Star, that it is a case of suicide due to overwrought nerves, may explain it.\"\n\"It might even be a natural death,\" Craig added. \"And that would make it a greater mystery than ever—a case for psychical research. One thing that I am going to do to-night will tell me much, however.\"\n\nAT the laboratory he unlocked a glass case and took out a little instrument which looked like two horizontal pendulums suspended by fine wires. There was a large magnet near each pendulum, and the end of each pendulum bore a needle which touched a circular drum driven by clock-work. Craig fussed with and adjusted the apparatus, while I said nothing, for I had long ago learned that in applying a new apparatus to doing old things Craig was as dumb as an oyster, until his work was crowned with success.\nWe had no trouble in getting in to see Mr. Vandam in his seance-room. His face was familiar to me, for I had seen him in public a number of times, but it looked strangely altered. He was nervous, and showed his age very perceptibly.",

      "summary": "In the opening segment of the detective story \"The Seismograph Adventure,\" we are introduced to a complex and puzzling case involving the mysterious death of Mrs. Vandam, a wealthy woman found unconscious in her home who subsequently dies without regaining consciousness. This segment sets the stage by presenting key characters, the perplexing circumstances surrounding Mrs. Vandam's illness and death, and the intriguing involvement of spiritualism that complicates the investigation.\n\nThe narrative begins with Craig Kennedy, a keen and methodical investigator, meeting Dr. James Hanson, the Coroner’s Physician, at the Criminal Courts Building. Dr. Hanson explains that he has been referred to Kennedy by Inspector O’Connor because the case has left the authorities baffled. The case in question—the Vandam case—has attracted widespread public and media attention, largely because it is a triple mystery: was Mrs. Vandam’s death caused by suicide, murder, or natural causes? Despite numerous theories and much speculation, no conclusive explanation has been reached.\n\nCraig Kennedy acknowledges that his current knowledge of the case is limited to newspaper reports, which causes Dr. Hanson to provide a detailed summary from his professional perspective. Mrs. Vandam was a woman in the prime of life, married to Henry Vandam, a wealthy retired banker nearly seventy years old, and poised to become one of America’s richest women through her dower rights. She was found late at night by her maid, unconscious and seated in the library, and passed away the following morning. The family physician attributes her death to natural causes, specifically uremic coma resulting from latent kidney disease. However, contrasting views exist in the press—some hinting at suicide, others alleging murder—making it a hotly debated case.\n\nDr. Hanson shares a crucial piece of evidence that has not been fully disclosed to the public: the presence of a small pill-box near Mrs. Vandam at the time she was found. The pill-box contained capsules labeled “One before retiring” with a druggist’s name and the initials “Dr. C.W.H.” Though six capsules were originally dispensed, only half were missing. The contents of the capsules included quinine and a small quantity of morphine. Initially, morphine poisoning was considered a potential cause of death, either accidental or suicidal, but this was ruled out because the key symptom of morphine poisoning—pinpoint, symmetrically contracted pupils—was not observed. Instead, Mrs. Vandam’s pupils were normal or slightly dilated and symmetrical, which is inconsistent with morphine poisoning but somewhat aligns with kidney-related coma. Furthermore, chemical analysis did not reveal any poisons beyond faint morphine traces, and Dr. Hanson asserts that such evidence would not hold up under expert toxicological scrutiny in court.\n\nCraig is shown the pill-box and the prescription, tools that might be pivotal in unraveling the mystery. Dr. Hanson also describes the eccentric character of Henry Vandam, especially his fascination with spiritualism, a subject that colors the case with a surreal and eerie atmosphere. Henry Vandam is deeply influenced by a medium named Mrs. May Popper and her manager, Mr. Howard Farrington. The old man’s belief in these figures is so strong that he keeps a detailed notebook tracking spiritual communications, including materializations and rappings—a kind of spirit tapping communication—recorded by time and place.\n\nThe narrative recounts the uncanny events on the night Mrs. Vandam took ill. Henry reported being awakened by a series of rappings and consulting his “control,” a spiritual guide he calls “John.” When asking if his wife was ill, he received affirmative raps, leading him to call the maid, who then found Mrs. Vandam unconscious. In subsequent nights, Henry claims to have been awakened at the same hour by communicative rappings, receiving messages purportedly from his deceased wife. Dr. Hanson remains skeptical, attributing these events to Henry’s overwrought imagination or coincidence, but acknowledges how deeply intertwined spiritualism is with the household dynamics.\n\nCraig requests and is quickly granted permission to enter the Vandam house to examine the scene and gather evidence firsthand. He is warned that the house is filled with spirit paintings and photographs, and that Henry Vandam’s quarters, particularly the séance-room, have an eerie quality. Additionally, Kennedy arranges to visit the coroner’s laboratory the following morning to closely inspect the autopsy findings related to the morphine question. The conversation ends with a clear understanding that details shared are confidential, underscoring the sensitivity of the case.\n\nFollowing this, Craig reveals to his companion, Jameson—a journalist attached to the Star newspaper and familiar with the case—that the investigation promises to be challenging and riddled with suspicion toward every individual involved. Jameson expresses his own doubts, suggesting that the Star’s popular theory of suicide induced by emotional strain remains viable, while Craig entertains the possibility that the death might even be natural but enveloped in a mystery suitable for psychical or paranormal study.\n\nBefore visiting Henry Vandam that night to witness the spiritual rappings firsthand, Craig prepares an unusual piece of equipment in his laboratory—a specialized instrument resembling two horizontal pendulums with magnets and needles recording movement onto a clockwork-driven drum. This preparation implies that Craig intends to use scientific instrumentation to objectively analyze what might otherwise be dismissed as supernatural phenomena.\n\nThey gain entrance to Henry Vandam’s séance-room without difficulty. Vandam is described as an aged, nervous man markedly changed by the recent events; his demeanor reflects the strain and mystery central to this case. The segment closes as Craig and Jameson begin what will likely be a thorough and methodical investigation into the strange death, blending forensic science with a study of the eerie spiritualism enveloping the Vandam household.\n\nOverall, this segment establishes the core mystery of Mrs. Vandam’s death—balancing medical, criminal, and supernatural explanations—and introduces us to the principal characters and conflicting clues. It outlines the key physical evidence such as the pill-box and the autopsy, the psychological and emotional tension within the family, and the unusual spiritualist elements that both cloud and deepen the enigma. As the investigation moves forward, these factors promise a multifaceted and thought-provoking puzzle for Craig Kennedy to unravel."

      "chunk_text": "It was as the coroner's physician had said. The house was littered with reminders of the cult, books, papers, curious daubs of paintings handsomely framed, and photographs; hazy overexposures, I should have called them, but Mr. Vandam took great pride in them, and Kennedy quite won him over by his admiration for them.\nThey talked about the rappings, and the old man explained where and when they occurred. They proceeded from a little cabinet or closet at one end of the room. It was evident that he was a thorough believer in them and in the messages they conveyed.\nCraig carefully noted everything about the room and then fell to admiring the spirit photographs, if such they might be called.\n\"The best of all I do not display, they are too precious,\" said the old man. \"Would you like to see them?\"\nCraig assented eagerly, and Vandam left us for a moment to get them. In an instant Craig had entered the cabinet, and in a dark corner on the floor he deposited the mechanism he had brought from the laboratory. Then he resumed his seat, shutting the box in which he had brought the mechanism, so that it would not appear that he had left anything about the room.\n\nARTFULLY he led the conversation along lines that interested the old man until he seemed to forget the hour. Not so, Craig. He knew it was nearing half-past twelve. The more they talked the more uncanny did this house and room of spirits seem to me. In fact, I was rapidly reaching the point where I could have sworn that once or twice something incorporeal brushed by me. I know now that it was purely imagination, but it shows what tricks the imagination can play on us.\nRap! rap! rap! rap! rap!\nFive times came a curiously hollow noise from the cabinet. If it had been possible I should certainly have fled, it was so sudden and unexpected. The hall clock downstairs struck the half- hour in those chimes written by Handel for St. Paul's.\nCraig leaned over to me and whispered hoarsely, \"Keep perfectly still—don't move a hand or foot.\"\nThe old man seemed utterly to have forgotten us. \"Is that you, John?\" he asked expectantly.\nRap! rap! rap! came the reply.\n\"Is Mary strong enough to speak to me to-night?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"Is she happy?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"What makes her unhappy? What does she want? Will you spell it out?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\nThen, after a pause, the rapping started slowly, and distinctly to spell out words. It was so weird and uncanny that I scarcely breathed. Letter after letter the message came, nineteen raps for \"s,\" eight for \"h,\" five for \"e,\" according to the place in the alphabet, numerically, of the required letter. At last it was complete.\n\"She thinks you are not well. She asks you to have that prescription filled again.\"\n\"Tell her I will do it to-morrow morning. Is there anything else?\"\nRap! rap! came back faintly:\n\"John, John, don't go yet,\" pleaded the old man earnestly. It was easy to see how thoroughly he believed in \"John,\" as perhaps well he might after the warning of his wife's death three nights before. \"Won't you answer one other question?\"\nFainter, almost imperceptibly, came a rap! rap!\n\nFOR several minutes the old man sat absorbed in thought, trance-like. Then, gradually, he seemed to realise that we were in the room with him. With difficulty he took up the thread of the conversation where the rappings had broken it.\n\"We were talking about the photographs,\" he said slowly. \"I hope soon to get one of my wife as she is now that she is transfigured. John has promised me one soon.\"\nHe was gathering up his treasures preparatory to putting them back in their places of safekeeping. The moment he was out of the room Craig darted into the cabinet and replaced his mechanism in the box. Then he began softly to tap the walls. At last he found the side that gave a noise similar to that which we had heard, and he seemed pleased to have found it, for he hastily sketched on an old envelope a plan of that part of the house, noting on it the location of the side of the cabinet.\n\nKENNEDY almost dragged me back to our apartment, he was in such a hurry to examine the apparatus at his leisure. He turned on all the lights, took the thing out of its case, and stripped off the two sheets of ruled paper wound around the two revolving drums. He laid them flat on the table and studied them for some minutes with evidently growing satisfaction.\nAt last he turned to me and said, \"Walter, here is a ghost caught in the act.\"\nI looked dubiously at the irregular up-and-down scrawl on the paper, while he rang up the Homicide Bureau of the Central Office and left word for O'Connor to call him up the first thing in the morning.\nStill eyeing with satisfaction the record traced on the sheets of paper, he lighted a cigarette in a matter-of-fact way and added: \"It proves to be a very much flesh-and-blood ghost, this 'John.' It walked up to the wall back of that cabinet, rapped, listened to old Vandam, rapped some more, got the answer it wanted, and walked deliberately away. The cabinet, as you may have noticed, is in a corner of the room with one side along the hallway. The ghost must have been in the hall.\"\n\"But who was it?\"\n\"Not so fast, Walter,\" laughed Craig. \"Isn't it enough for one night that we have found out that much?\"\nFortunately I was tired, or I certainly should have dreamed of rappings and of \"John\" that night. I was awakened early by Kennedy talking with someone over the telephone. It was Inspector O'Connor.\nOf course I heard only one side of the conversation, but as near as I could gather Kennedy was asking the inspector to obtain several samples of ink for him.

      "prompt": "Continue summarizing Detective story 'The Seismograph Adventure' by Unknown. This is part 2 of 4 segments. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-1):\nIn the opening segment of the detective story \"The Seismograph Adventure,\" we are introduced to a complex and puzzling case involving the mysterious death of Mrs. Vandam, a wealthy woman found unconscious in her home who subsequently dies without regaining consciousness. This segment sets the stage by presenting key characters, the perplexing circumstances surrounding Mrs. Vandam's illness and death, and the intriguing involvement of spiritualism that complicates the investigation.\n\nThe narrative begins with Craig Kennedy, a keen and methodical investigator, meeting Dr. James Hanson, the Coroner’s Physician, at the Criminal Courts Building. Dr. Hanson explains that he has been referred to Kennedy by Inspector O’Connor because the case has left the authorities baffled. The case in question—the Vandam case—has attracted widespread public and media attention, largely because it is a triple mystery: was Mrs. Vandam’s death caused by suicide, murder, or natural causes? Despite numerous theories and much speculation, no conclusive explanation has been reached.\n\nCraig Kennedy acknowledges that his current knowledge of the case is limited to newspaper reports, which causes Dr. Hanson to provide a detailed summary from his professional perspective. Mrs. Vandam was a woman in the prime of life, married to Henry Vandam, a wealthy retired banker nearly seventy years old, and poised to become one of America’s richest women through her dower rights. She was found late at night by her maid, unconscious and seated in the library, and passed away the following morning. The family physician attributes her death to natural causes, specifically uremic coma resulting from latent kidney disease. However, contrasting views exist in the press—some hinting at suicide, others alleging murder—making it a hotly debated case.\n\nDr. Hanson shares a crucial piece of evidence that has not been fully disclosed to the public: the presence of a small pill-box near Mrs. Vandam at the time she was found. The pill-box contained capsules labeled “One before retiring” with a druggist’s name and the initials “Dr. C.W.H.” Though six capsules were originally dispensed, only half were missing. The contents of the capsules included quinine and a small quantity of morphine. Initially, morphine poisoning was considered a potential cause of death, either accidental or suicidal, but this was ruled out because the key symptom of morphine poisoning—pinpoint, symmetrically contracted pupils—was not observed. Instead, Mrs. Vandam’s pupils were normal or slightly dilated and symmetrical, which is inconsistent with morphine poisoning but somewhat aligns with kidney-related coma. Furthermore, chemical analysis did not reveal any poisons beyond faint morphine traces, and Dr. Hanson asserts that such evidence would not hold up under expert toxicological scrutiny in court.\n\nCraig is shown the pill-box and the prescription, tools that might be pivotal in unraveling the mystery. Dr. Hanson also describes the eccentric character of Henry Vandam, especially his fascination with spiritualism, a subject that colors the case with a surreal and eerie atmosphere. Henry Vandam is deeply influenced by a medium named Mrs. May Popper and her manager, Mr. Howard Farrington. The old man’s belief in these figures is so strong that he keeps a detailed notebook tracking spiritual communications, including materializations and rappings—a kind of spirit tapping communication—recorded by time and place.\n\nThe narrative recounts the uncanny events on the night Mrs. Vandam took ill. Henry reported being awakened by a series of rappings and consulting his “control,” a spiritual guide he calls “John.” When asking if his wife was ill, he received affirmative raps, leading him to call the maid, who then found Mrs. Vandam unconscious. In subsequent nights, Henry claims to have been awakened at the same hour by communicative rappings, receiving messages purportedly from his deceased wife. Dr. Hanson remains skeptical, attributing these events to Henry’s overwrought imagination or coincidence, but acknowledges how deeply intertwined spiritualism is with the household dynamics.\n\nCraig requests and is quickly granted permission to enter the Vandam house to examine the scene and gather evidence firsthand. He is warned that the house is filled with spirit paintings and photographs, and that Henry Vandam’s quarters, particularly the séance-room, have an eerie quality. Additionally, Kennedy arranges to visit the coroner’s laboratory the following morning to closely inspect the autopsy findings related to the morphine question. The conversation ends with a clear understanding that details shared are confidential, underscoring the sensitivity of the case.\n\nFollowing this, Craig reveals to his companion, Jameson—a journalist attached to the Star newspaper and familiar with the case—that the investigation promises to be challenging and riddled with suspicion toward every individual involved. Jameson expresses his own doubts, suggesting that the Star’s popular theory of suicide induced by emotional strain remains viable, while Craig entertains the possibility that the death might even be natural but enveloped in a mystery suitable for psychical or paranormal study.\n\nBefore visiting Henry Vandam that night to witness the spiritual rappings firsthand, Craig prepares an unusual piece of equipment in his laboratory—a specialized instrument resembling two horizontal pendulums with magnets and needles recording movement onto a clockwork-driven drum. This preparation implies that Craig intends to use scientific instrumentation to objectively analyze what might otherwise be dismissed as supernatural phenomena.\n\nThey gain entrance to Henry Vandam’s séance-room without difficulty. Vandam is described as an aged, nervous man markedly changed by the recent events; his demeanor reflects the strain and mystery central to this case. The segment closes as Craig and Jameson begin what will likely be a thorough and methodical investigation into the strange death, blending forensic science with a study of the eerie spiritualism enveloping the Vandam household.\n\nOverall, this segment establishes the core mystery of Mrs. Vandam’s death—balancing medical, criminal, and supernatural explanations—and introduces us to the principal characters and conflicting clues. It outlines the key physical evidence such as the pill-box and the autopsy, the psychological and emotional tension within the family, and the unusual spiritualist elements that both cloud and deepen the enigma. As the investigation moves forward, these factors promise a multifaceted and thought-provoking puzzle for Craig Kennedy to unravel.\n\nCurrent segment (part 2):\nIt was as the coroner's physician had said. The house was littered with reminders of the cult, books, papers, curious daubs of paintings handsomely framed, and photographs; hazy overexposures, I should have called them, but Mr. Vandam took great pride in them, and Kennedy quite won him over by his admiration for them.\nThey talked about the rappings, and the old man explained where and when they occurred. They proceeded from a little cabinet or closet at one end of the room. It was evident that he was a thorough believer in them and in the messages they conveyed.\nCraig carefully noted everything about the room and then fell to admiring the spirit photographs, if such they might be called.\n\"The best of all I do not display, they are too precious,\" said the old man. \"Would you like to see them?\"\nCraig assented eagerly, and Vandam left us for a moment to get them. In an instant Craig had entered the cabinet, and in a dark corner on the floor he deposited the mechanism he had brought from the laboratory. Then he resumed his seat, shutting the box in which he had brought the mechanism, so that it would not appear that he had left anything about the room.\n\nARTFULLY he led the conversation along lines that interested the old man until he seemed to forget the hour. Not so, Craig. He knew it was nearing half-past twelve. The more they talked the more uncanny did this house and room of spirits seem to me. In fact, I was rapidly reaching the point where I could have sworn that once or twice something incorporeal brushed by me. I know now that it was purely imagination, but it shows what tricks the imagination can play on us.\nRap! rap! rap! rap! rap!\nFive times came a curiously hollow noise from the cabinet. If it had been possible I should certainly have fled, it was so sudden and unexpected. The hall clock downstairs struck the half- hour in those chimes written by Handel for St. Paul's.\nCraig leaned over to me and whispered hoarsely, \"Keep perfectly still—don't move a hand or foot.\"\nThe old man seemed utterly to have forgotten us. \"Is that you, John?\" he asked expectantly.\nRap! rap! rap! came the reply.\n\"Is Mary strong enough to speak to me to-night?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"Is she happy?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"What makes her unhappy? What does she want? Will you spell it out?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\nThen, after a pause, the rapping started slowly, and distinctly to spell out words. It was so weird and uncanny that I scarcely breathed. Letter after letter the message came, nineteen raps for \"s,\" eight for \"h,\" five for \"e,\" according to the place in the alphabet, numerically, of the required letter. At last it was complete.\n\"She thinks you are not well. She asks you to have that prescription filled again.\"\n\"Tell her I will do it to-morrow morning. Is there anything else?\"\nRap! rap! came back faintly:\n\"John, John, don't go yet,\" pleaded the old man earnestly. It was easy to see how thoroughly he believed in \"John,\" as perhaps well he might after the warning of his wife's death three nights before. \"Won't you answer one other question?\"\nFainter, almost imperceptibly, came a rap! rap!\n\nFOR several minutes the old man sat absorbed in thought, trance-like. Then, gradually, he seemed to realise that we were in the room with him. With difficulty he took up the thread of the conversation where the rappings had broken it.\n\"We were talking about the photographs,\" he said slowly. \"I hope soon to get one of my wife as she is now that she is transfigured. John has promised me one soon.\"\nHe was gathering up his treasures preparatory to putting them back in their places of safekeeping. The moment he was out of the room Craig darted into the cabinet and replaced his mechanism in the box. Then he began softly to tap the walls. At last he found the side that gave a noise similar to that which we had heard, and he seemed pleased to have found it, for he hastily sketched on an old envelope a plan of that part of the house, noting on it the location of the side of the cabinet.\n\nKENNEDY almost dragged me back to our apartment, he was in such a hurry to examine the apparatus at his leisure. He turned on all the lights, took the thing out of its case, and stripped off the two sheets of ruled paper wound around the two revolving drums. He laid them flat on the table and studied them for some minutes with evidently growing satisfaction.\nAt last he turned to me and said, \"Walter, here is a ghost caught in the act.\"\nI looked dubiously at the irregular up-and-down scrawl on the paper, while he rang up the Homicide Bureau of the Central Office and left word for O'Connor to call him up the first thing in the morning.\nStill eyeing with satisfaction the record traced on the sheets of paper, he lighted a cigarette in a matter-of-fact way and added: \"It proves to be a very much flesh-and-blood ghost, this 'John.' It walked up to the wall back of that cabinet, rapped, listened to old Vandam, rapped some more, got the answer it wanted, and walked deliberately away. The cabinet, as you may have noticed, is in a corner of the room with one side along the hallway. The ghost must have been in the hall.\"\n\"But who was it?\"\n\"Not so fast, Walter,\" laughed Craig. \"Isn't it enough for one night that we have found out that much?\"\nFortunately I was tired, or I certainly should have dreamed of rappings and of \"John\" that night. I was awakened early by Kennedy talking with someone over the telephone. It was Inspector O'Connor.\nOf course I heard only one side of the conversation, but as near as I could gather Kennedy was asking the inspector to obtain several samples of ink for him. I had not heard the first part of the conversation, and was considerably surprised when Kennedy hung up the receiver and said:\n\"Vandam had the prescription filled again early this morning, and it will soon be in the hands of O'Connor. I hope I haven't spoiled things by acting too soon, but I don't want to run the risk of a double tragedy.\"\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

The investigation is centered around three possibilities for her death: suicide, murder, or natural causes. The case attracts significant public and press attention due to its baffling nature and the unusual spiritualist elements entwined with the family.\n\nThe investigation is led by Craig Kennedy, a methodical and scientifically minded investigator, who is initially briefed on the case by Dr. James Hanson, the Coroner’s Physician. Dr. Hanson describes Mrs. Vandam as a woman in her prime and married to Henry Vandam, a retired banker in his seventies, soon to be one of America’s richest men due to his wife’s dower rights. Despite the family physician’s conclusion that Mrs. Vandam died from a uremic coma—a natural cause linked to kidney disease—public speculation and various theories abound. The discovery of a small pillbox near Mrs. Vandam, containing partially used capsules of quinine and morphine, adds to the complexity. However, morphine poisoning is ruled out as a cause due to the absence of characteristic symptoms, and toxicological tests reveal only faint morphine traces, unlikely to affect her death.\n\nHenry Vandam’s eccentric character complicates the case further. He is a fervent believer in spiritualism and is deeply involved with a medium known as Mrs. May Popper and her manager, Mr. Howard Farrington. Vandam keeps meticulous records of spirit communications, including rappings—knocking sounds supposedly made by spirits to convey messages. On the night Mrs. Vandam fell ill, Henry was awakened by rappings and, believing them to be messages from his deceased wife, summoned the maid who found Mrs. Vandam unconscious. Subsequent nights saw Henry receiving more rappings and receiving messages he is convinced come from beyond the grave. Though Dr. Hanson is skeptical of these spiritual phenomena, recognizing them as likely the product of Henry’s imagination or coincidence, the spiritualist atmosphere pervades the household and influences the investigation.\n\nCraig Kennedy gains permission to enter the Vandam house to conduct an in-depth examination. The house is filled with numerous spiritualist artifacts such as paintings, photographs—many of which are strange, hazy overexposures—and various books and papers related to spiritualism. Kennedy’s scientific approach is underscored by his preparation of a unique apparatus resembling horizontal pendulums with magnets and needles that can record subtle movements onto a clockwork-driven drum. He plans to use this equipment to monitor the séance-room, hoping to detect any physical causes for the supposed supernatural rappings.\n\nDuring a late-night visit to Henry Vandam’s séance-room, Kennedy and his companion Jameson, a journalist following the case closely, observe the environment charged with spiritualist paraphernalia and an eerie atmosphere. Vandam is visibly worn and nervous, deeply engrossed in his belief in the séances and rappings. As the night unfolds, Kennedy skillfully conceals his device inside a cabinet at one end of the séance-room, all the while engaging Vandam in conversation to distract him.\n\nAs the clock strikes half-past midnight, the mysterious rappings begin, emanating from the cabinet where the device was hidden. The knocking is sudden and hollow, startling the observers. Henry Vandam enthusiastically interacts with the rappings, believing them to be communications from his spirit guide, “John,” and from his deceased wife, Mary. Through a series of raps, “John” supposedly spells out a message, using numerical rapping corresponding to alphabet letters. The message conveyed is that Mary thinks Henry is unwell and instructs him to have a prescription refilled—a prescription evidently related to Mrs. Vandam’s prior medication.\n\nHenry becomes entranced by the experience, pleading for further responses from “John,” and discussing plans to obtain spirit photographs of his transfigured wife. After the séance, the investigators quickly retrieve Kennedy’s hidden recording device from the cabinet, and Kennedy taps on the cabinet’s surfaces to find the exact wall panels that could produce sounds akin to the rappings. He carefully diagrams the room and the cabinet layout, noting the potential locations where noises could be created or amplified.\n\nBack at their apartment, a fatigued Kennedy dissected the recordings from his apparatus. The mechanical pens had traced irregular, up-and-down scribbles reflecting movements correlated to the rappings heard during the séance. Kennedy confidently refers to this evidence as “a ghost caught in the act,” interpreting the data as proof that the rappings were caused by a living person physically moving to the wall behind the cabinet—specifically on the hallway side, adjoining that cabinet. He hypothesizes that the mysterious “John” was a very tangible, flesh-and-blood “ghost” who physically approached the cabinet to create the sounds and then retreated, making the spiritualist communication a likely fraud or trick.\n\nKennedy refrains from jumping to conclusions regarding the identity of the person responsible for the rappings, indicating the need for further inquiry. The following morning Kennedy speaks with police Inspector O’Connor by telephone, arranging for him to secure samples of ink for further forensic analysis. Kennedy has learned that Henry Vandam had the prescription in question refilled early that morning, suggesting that the message brought by the spirit might have been an actual warning from the spirit world, or alternatively, a ruse meant to influence Henry’s actions.\n\nThis segment of the story enriches the narrative by blending keen scientific observation with the mysterious and supernatural ambiance enveloping the Vandam household. It moves the investigation beyond theoretical speculation into a realm where empirical evidence confronts spiritualist claims. Kennedy’s use of technological apparatus to capture physical proof of the rappings epitomizes the central theme of the story—the clash between rational investigation and paranormal belief.\n\nIn sum, the plot thickens as it is revealed that the purported spirit communications Carl Vandam trusts are actually accompanied by tangible physical movements detected and recorded by Kennedy’s device. The possibility that the rappings are fabricated by someone physically present indicates a deliberate attempt to deceive, suggesting criminal implications. Yet, the spiritualist beliefs of Vandam entangle the case emotionally and psychologically, complicating the motives and suspects.\n\nOverall, the investigation now faces multiple intertwined layers: medical and forensic inquiry into Mrs. Vandam’s death, psychological analysis of Henry Vandam’s credulity and grief, and the uncovering of a likely trick or human manipulation behind the rappings. Craig Kennedy’s objective scrutiny combined with his readiness to explore the unusual provides a strong foundation to unravel this multifaceted mystery as the story proceeds."

      "chunk_text": "\"Well,\" I said, \"it is incomprehensible to me. First I suspected suicide. Then I suspected murder. Now I almost suspect a murder and a suicide. The fact is, I don't know just what I suspect. I'm like Dr. Hanson—floored. I wonder if Vandam would voluntarily take all the capsules at once in order to be with his wife?\"\n\"One of them alone would be quite sufficient if the 'ghost' should take a notion, as I think it will, to walk in the daytime,\" replied Craig enigmatically. \"I don't want to run any chances, as I have said. I may be wrong in my theory of the case, Walter, so let us not discuss this phase of it until I have gone a step farther and am sure of my ground. O'Connor's man will get the capsules before Vandam has a chance to take the first one, anyhow. The 'ghost' had a purpose in that message, for O'Connor tells me that Vandam's lawyer visited him yesterday and in all probability a new will is being made, perhaps has already been made.\"\n\nWE breakfasted in silence and later rode down to the office of Dr. Hanson, who greeted us enthusiastically.\n\"I've solved it at last,\" he cried, \"and it's easy.\"\nKennedy looked gravely over the analysis which Dr. Hanson shoved into his hand, and seemed very much interested in the probable quantity of morphine that must have been taken to yield such an analysis. The physician had a text-book open on his desk.\n\"Our old ideas of the infallible test of morphine poisoning are all exploded,\" he said, excitedly beginning to read a passage he had marked in the book.\n\"'I have thought that inequality of the pupils, that is to say, where they are not symmetrically contracted, is proof that a case is not one of narcotism, or morphine poisoning. But Professor Taylor has recorded a case of morphine poisoning in which the unsymmetrical contraction occurred.'\n\"There, now, until I happened to run across that in one of the authorities I had supposed the symmetrical contraction of the pupils of the eyes to be the distinguishing symptom of morphine poisoning Professor Kennedy, in my opinion we can, after all, make out our case as one of morphine poisoning.\"\n\"Is that case in the book all you base your opinion on?\" asked Craig with excessive politeness.\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the doctor reluctantly.\n\"Well,\" said Kennedy quietly, \"if you will investigate that case quoted from Professor Taylor, you will find that it has been proved that the patient had one glass eye.\"\n\"Then my contention collapses and she was not poisoned?\"\n\"No, I do not say that. All I say is that expert testimony would refute us as far as we have gone. But if you will let me make a few tests of my own I can readily clear up that end of the case, I now feel sure. Let me take these samples to my laboratory.\"\nI was surprised when we ran into Inspector O'Connor waiting for us in the corridor of the Criminal Courts Building as we left the office of the coroner's physician. He rushed up to Kennedy and shoved into his hand a pill-box in which six capsules rattled. Kennedy narrowly inspected the box, opened it, and looked thoughtfully at the six white capsules lying so innocently within.\n\"One of these capsules would have been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to 'John,'\" said Craig contemplatively, as he shut the box and deposited it carefully in his inside vest pocket. \"I don't believe I even said good morning to you, O'Connor,\" he continued. \"I hope I haven't kept you waiting here long. Have you obtained the samples of ink?\"\n\"Yes, Professor. Here they are. As soon as you telephoned this morning I sent my men out separately to get them. There's the ink from the druggist, this is from the Vandam library, this is from Farrington's room, and this is from Mrs. Popper's apartment.\"\n\"Thank you, Inspector. I don't know what I'd do without your help,\" said Kennedy, eagerly taking four small vials from him. \"Science is all right, but organisation enables science to work quickly. And quickness is the essence of this case.\"\n\nDURING the afternoon Kennedy was very busy in his laboratory, where I found him that night after my hurried dinner, from which he was absent.\n\"What, is it after dinner-time?\" he exclaimed, holding up a glass beaker and watching the reaction of something he poured into it from a test-tube.\n\"Craig, I believe that when you are absorbed in a case, you would rather work than eat. Did you have any lunch after I left you?\"\n\"I don't think so,\" he replied, regarding the beaker and not his answer. \"Now, Walter, old fellow, I don't want you to be offended with me, but really I can work better if you don't constantly remind me of such things as eating and sleeping. Say, do you want to help me—really?\"\n\"Certainly. I am as interested in the case as you are, but I can't make heads or tails of it,\" I replied.\n\"Then, I wish you would look up Mrs. Popper to-night and have a private seance with her. What I want you to do particularly is to get a good idea of the looks of the room in which she is accustomed to work. I'm going to duplicate it here in my laboratory as nearly as possible. Then I want you to arrange with her for a private 'circle' here to-morrow night. Tell her it is with a few professors at the university who are interested in psychical research and that Mr. Vandam will be present. I'd rather have her come willingly than to force her to come. Incidentally watch that manager of hers, Farrington. By all means he must accompany her.\"\n\nTHAT evening I dropped casually in on Mrs. Popper. She was a woman of great brilliance and delicacy, both in her physical and mental perceptions, of exceptional vivacity and cleverness. She must have studied me more closely than I was aware of, for I believe she relied on diverting my attention whenever she desired to produce one of her really wonderful results. Needless to say, I was completely mystified by her performance. She did spirit writing that would have done credit to the immortal Slade, told me a lot of things that were true, and many more that were unverifiable or hopelessly vague. It was really worth much more than the price, and I did not need to feign the interest necessary to get her terms for a circle in the laboratory.\nOf course I had to make the terms with Farrington. The first glance aroused my suspicions of him. He was shifty-eyed, and his face had a hard and mercenary look. In spite of, perhaps rather because of, my repugnance we quickly came to an agreement, and as I left the apartment I mentally resolved to keep my eye on him.\nCraig came in late, having been engaged in his chemical analyses all the evening. From his manner I inferred that they had been satisfactory, and he seemed much gratified when I told him that I had arranged successfully for the seance and that Farrington would accompany the medium.\nAs we were talking over the case a messenger arrived with a note from O'Connor. It was written with his usual brevity: \"Have just found from servants that Farrington and Mrs. P. have key to Vandam house. Wish I had known it before. House shadowed. No one has entered or left it to-night.\"\nCraig looked at his watch. It was a quarter after one. \"The ghost won't walk to-night, Walter,\" he said as he entered his bedroom for a much-needed rest. \"I guess I was right after all in getting the capsules as soon as possible. The ghost must have flitted unobserved in there this morning directly after the maid brought them back from the druggist.\"\nAgain, the next morning, he had me out of bed bright and early. As we descended from the Sixth Avenue \"L,\" he led me into a peculiar little shop in the shadow of the \"L\" structure. He entered as though he knew the place well; but, then, that air of assurance was Kennedy's stock in trade and sat very well on him.\n\nFEW people, I suppose, have ever had a glimpse of this workshop of magic and deception. This little shop of Marina's was the headquarters of the magicians of the country. Levitation and ghostly disappearing hands were on every side. The shelves in the back of the shop were full of nickel, brass, wire, wood, and papier-maché contrivances, new and strange to the eye of the uninitiated. Yet it was all as systematic as a hardware shop.\n\"Is Signor Marina in?\" asked Craig of a girl in the first room, given up to picture post-cards. The room was as deceptive as the trade, for it was only an anteroom to the storeroom I have described above. This storeroom was also a factory, and half a dozen artisans were hard at work in it.\nYes, the signor was in, the girl replied, leading us back into the workshop. He proved to be a short man with a bland, open face and frank eyes, the very antithesis of his trade.\n\"I have arranged for a circle with Mrs. May Popper,\" began Kennedy, handing the man his card. \"I suppose you know her?\"\n\"Indeed yes,\" he answered. \"I furnished her seance room.\"",

First I suspected suicide. Then I suspected murder. Now I almost suspect a murder and a suicide. The fact is, I don't know just what I suspect. I'm like Dr. Hanson—floored. I wonder if Vandam would voluntarily take all the capsules at once in order to be with his wife?\"\n\"One of them alone would be quite sufficient if the 'ghost' should take a notion, as I think it will, to walk in the daytime,\" replied Craig enigmatically. \"I don't want to run any chances, as I have said. I may be wrong in my theory of the case, Walter, so let us not discuss this phase of it until I have gone a step farther and am sure of my ground. O'Connor's man will get the capsules before Vandam has a chance to take the first one, anyhow. The 'ghost' had a purpose in that message, for O'Connor tells me that Vandam's lawyer visited him yesterday and in all probability a new will is being made, perhaps has already been made.\"\n\nWE breakfasted in silence and later rode down to the office of Dr. Hanson, who greeted us enthusiastically.\n\"I've solved it at last,\" he cried, \"and it's easy.\"\nKennedy looked gravely over the analysis which Dr. Hanson shoved into his hand, and seemed very much interested in the probable quantity of morphine that must have been taken to yield such an analysis. The physician had a text-book open on his desk.\n\"Our old ideas of the infallible test of morphine poisoning are all exploded,\" he said, excitedly beginning to read a passage he had marked in the book.\n\"'I have thought that inequality of the pupils, that is to say, where they are not symmetrically contracted, is proof that a case is not one of narcotism, or morphine poisoning. But Professor Taylor has recorded a case of morphine poisoning in which the unsymmetrical contraction occurred.'\n\"There, now, until I happened to run across that in one of the authorities I had supposed the symmetrical contraction of the pupils of the eyes to be the distinguishing symptom of morphine poisoning Professor Kennedy, in my opinion we can, after all, make out our case as one of morphine poisoning.\"\n\"Is that case in the book all you base your opinion on?\" asked Craig with excessive politeness.\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the doctor reluctantly.\n\"Well,\" said Kennedy quietly, \"if you will investigate that case quoted from Professor Taylor, you will find that it has been proved that the patient had one glass eye.\"\n\"Then my contention collapses and she was not poisoned?\"\n\"No, I do not say that. All I say is that expert testimony would refute us as far as we have gone. But if you will let me make a few tests of my own I can readily clear up that end of the case, I now feel sure. Let me take these samples to my laboratory.\"\nI was surprised when we ran into Inspector O'Connor waiting for us in the corridor of the Criminal Courts Building as we left the office of the coroner's physician. He rushed up to Kennedy and shoved into his hand a pill-box in which six capsules rattled. Kennedy narrowly inspected the box, opened it, and looked thoughtfully at the six white capsules lying so innocently within.\n\"One of these capsules would have been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to 'John,'\" said Craig contemplatively, as he shut the box and deposited it carefully in his inside vest pocket. \"I don't believe I even said good morning to you, O'Connor,\" he continued. \"I hope I haven't kept you waiting here long. Have you obtained the samples of ink?\"\n\"Yes, Professor. Here they are. As soon as you telephoned this morning I sent my men out separately to get them. There's the ink from the druggist, this is from the Vandam library, this is from Farrington's room, and this is from Mrs. Popper's apartment.\"\n\"Thank you, Inspector. I don't know what I'd do without your help,\" said Kennedy, eagerly taking four small vials from him. \"Science is all right, but organisation enables science to work quickly. And quickness is the essence of this case.\"\n\nDURING the afternoon Kennedy was very busy in his laboratory, where I found him that night after my hurried dinner, from which he was absent.\n\"What, is it after dinner-time?\" he exclaimed, holding up a glass beaker and watching the reaction of something he poured into it from a test-tube.\n\"Craig, I believe that when you are absorbed in a case, you would rather work than eat. Did you have any lunch after I left you?\"\n\"I don't think so,\" he replied, regarding the beaker and not his answer. \"Now, Walter, old fellow, I don't want you to be offended with me, but really I can work better if you don't constantly remind me of such things as eating and sleeping. Say, do you want to help me—really?\"\n\"Certainly. I am as interested in the case as you are, but I can't make heads or tails of it,\" I replied.\n\"Then, I wish you would look up Mrs. Popper to-night and have a private seance with her. What I want you to do particularly is to get a good idea of the looks of the room in which she is accustomed to work. I'm going to duplicate it here in my laboratory as nearly as possible. Then I want you to arrange with her for a private 'circle' here to-morrow night. Tell her it is with a few professors at the university who are interested in psychical research and that Mr. Vandam will be present. I'd rather have her come willingly than to force her to come. Incidentally watch that manager of hers, Farrington. By all means he must accompany her.\"\n\nTHAT evening I dropped casually in on Mrs. Popper. She was a woman of great brilliance and delicacy, both in her physical and mental perceptions, of exceptional vivacity and cleverness. She must have studied me more closely than I was aware of, for I believe she relied on diverting my attention whenever she desired to produce one of her really wonderful results. Needless to say, I was completely mystified by her performance. She did spirit writing that would have done credit to the immortal Slade, told me a lot of things that were true, and many more that were unverifiable or hopelessly vague. It was really worth much more than the price, and I did not need to feign the interest necessary to get her terms for a circle in the laboratory.\nOf course I had to make the terms with Farrington. The first glance aroused my suspicions of him. He was shifty-eyed, and his face had a hard and mercenary look. In spite of, perhaps rather because of, my repugnance we quickly came to an agreement, and as I left the apartment I mentally resolved to keep my eye on him.\nCraig came in late, having been engaged in his chemical analyses all the evening. From his manner I inferred that they had been satisfactory, and he seemed much gratified when I told him that I had arranged successfully for the seance and that Farrington would accompany the medium.\nAs we were talking over the case a messenger arrived with a note from O'Connor. It was written with his usual brevity: \"Have just found from servants that Farrington and Mrs. P. have key to Vandam house. Wish I had known it before. House shadowed. No one has entered or left it to-night.\"\nCraig looked at his watch. It was a quarter after one. \"The ghost won't walk to-night, Walter,\" he said as he entered his bedroom for a much-needed rest. \"I guess I was right after all in getting the capsules as soon as possible. The ghost must have flitted unobserved in there this morning directly after the maid brought them back from the druggist.\"\nAgain, the next morning, he had me out of bed bright and early. As we descended from the Sixth Avenue \"L,\" he led me into a peculiar little shop in the shadow of the \"L\" structure. He entered as though he knew the place well; but, then, that air of assurance was Kennedy's stock in trade and sat very well on him.\n\nFEW people, I suppose, have ever had a glimpse of this workshop of magic and deception. This little shop of Marina's was the headquarters of the magicians of the country. Levitation and ghostly disappearing hands were on every side. The shelves in the back of the shop were full of nickel, brass, wire, wood, and papier-maché contrivances, new and strange to the eye of the uninitiated. Yet it was all as systematic as a hardware shop.\n\"Is Signor Marina in?\" asked Craig of a girl in the first room, given up to picture post-cards. The room was as deceptive as the trade, for it was only an anteroom to the storeroom I have described above. This storeroom was also a factory, and half a dozen artisans were hard at work in it.\nYes, the signor was in, the girl replied, leading us back into the workshop. He proved to be a short man with a bland, open face and frank eyes, the very antithesis of his trade.\n\"I have arranged for a circle with Mrs. May Popper,\" began Kennedy, handing the man his card. \"I suppose you know her?\"\n\"Indeed yes,\" he answered. \"I furnished her seance room.\"\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "“The Seismograph Adventure” is a layered detective story that intertwines medical mystery, spiritualism, and scientific inquiry, centered on the enigmatic death of Mrs. Vandam. Initially found unconscious late one night in her affluent home and dying the next morning without regaining consciousness, Mrs. Vandam’s cause of death sparks debate between suicide, murder, and natural causes. The case is complicated by her husband Henry Vandam’s eccentric belief in spiritualism and the ongoing spiritual phenomena reported in the household.\n\nThe investigation is led by Craig Kennedy, a scientifically rigorous detective with a penchant for combining technology with methodical observation. He is briefed by Dr. James Hanson, the coroner’s physician, who initially suspects a uremic coma linked to kidney disease as the cause of death. Mrs. Vandam’s mysterious death draws public interest not only because of the unclear medical cause but also due to the involvement of séances, rappings (knocking sounds believed to be spirit communications), and a medium named Mrs. May Popper, who, along with her manager Howard Farrington, is deeply entwined with Henry Vandam’s household.\n\nKennedy’s approach sharply contrasts with Henry’s spiritualist convictions. Henry, a retired banker soon to be enormously wealthy through his wife’s dower rights, is obsessive about spirit communications. On the night Mrs. Vandam became ill, Henry was roused by rappings which he interpreted as messages from his deceased wife, leading to the discovery of her unconscious state. Over following nights, Henry receives further rappings and messages, notably from a spirit identity he calls “John.” Yet, Dr. Hanson and others remain skeptical of these supernatural claims and lean toward naturalistic or criminal explanations.\n\nA breakthrough in the investigation comes when Kennedy brings a specially designed scientific apparatus to the Vandam séance-room. This device, a form of sensitive seismograph, records subtle physical movements on a clockwork-driven drum. During a late-night séance attended by Kennedy and his companion, journalist Jameson, mysterious rappings are heard emanating from a cabinet in the séance room. The spirit “John” supposedly spells out a message advising Henry to refill a certain prescription related to Mrs. Vandam’s medications. Although Henry wholeheartedly believes in the supernatural origin of these rappings, Kennedy’s apparatus traces them to physical movements against the cabinet wall on the hallway side, suggesting a human performer behind the façade of spiritual communication.\n\nFollowing this scientific encounter with the “ghost,” Kennedy and his associates begin to scrutinize the various facets of the case more closely. The possibility emerges that someone is physically masquerading as a spirit to manipulate Henry Vandam, influencing his actions—particularly around the refilling of a prescription which could be pivotal to understanding Mrs. Vandam’s death. Adding to this intrigue is the knowledge that Henry’s lawyer recently visited Inspector O’Connor, possibly to arrange a new will, indicating potential financial motives.\n\nThe third segment of the story deepens the complexity. Kennedy debates the nature of the case with his friend Walter Jameson and Dr. Hanson, vacillating between theories of suicide, murder, or a combination of both. The mystery of whether Henry Vandam himself might take a lethal dose of capsules to join his deceased wife is raised, especially as one capsule alone might be deadly. However, Kennedy urges caution in forming conclusions before conducting further tests.\n\nAt Dr. Hanson’s office, a spirited discussion arises around the diagnosis of morphine poisoning. Dr. Hanson argues that asymmetrical pupil contraction—a key symptom in Mrs. Vandam’s case—is inconsistent with morphine poisoning, citing a medical text to support his view. Kennedy challenges this, revealing that the referenced case involved a patient with one glass eye, thereby undermining the argument. Though Dr. Hanson admits this weakens the case for poisoning, he remains open to more thorough laboratory analyses.\n\nInspector O'Connor brings Kennedy a pillbox containing six capsules that hold significant evidentiary value. Kennedy carefully safeguards the capsules, noting that the “ghost,” or whoever impersonates it, had a vested interest in the message prompting the prescription refill. O’Connor also hands over ink samples taken covertly from various key locations—the druggist, Vandam’s library, Farrington’s room, and Mrs. Popper’s apartment—preparing for forensic ink analysis that could reveal tampering with documents like a new will.\n\nKennedy’s laboratory becomes the hub for these critical investigations. Absorbed in chemical testing, he directs Walter to visit Mrs. Popper for a private séance to observe her environment and demeanor closely in preparation for a planned séance in Kennedy’s own laboratory. This séance is intended to be attended by scientific observers and importantly, Henry Vandam. Kennedy’s request to include Farrington, Mrs. Popper's somewhat dubious manager, reveals his suspicion toward the man, whose mercenary nature and shifty eyes cast him as a likely suspect in the unfolding deception.\n\nWalter’s evening encounter with Mrs. Popper confirms her brilliance in spiritualist performance—her spirit writing and messages impressively convincing, yet Walter remains wary of her ability to distract and manipulate. Negotiations with Farrington, despite suspicions, conclude with an agreement for the séance to be held at Kennedy’s lab under controlled conditions.\n\nA timely message from O’Connor confirms that both Mrs. Popper and Farrington have keys to the Vandam house and that the premises have been under surveillance with no unauthorized entries or exits, suggesting the “ghost” must have acted earlier the same morning, undetected.\n\nFinally, Kennedy leads Walter to a secretive magical workshop run by Signor Marina, a craftsman of illusions and mechanical devices used by professional magicians and spiritualists alike. This discovery is critical—it hints that the spiritual phenomena in the Vandam case may be manufactured through trickery with the help of sophisticated apparatus and illusions possibly supplied by Marina to Mrs. Popper’s séances.\n\nOverall, the investigation stands at a crossroads between the realms of reason and superstition. The story juxtaposes Kennedy’s scientific rigor—exemplified by his use of mechanical recording devices, chemical tests, and forensic ink analysis—with the emotional and psychological dimensions of Henry Vandam’s spiritualist faith and grief. It highlights how spiritualistic sessions are manipulated by human hands, threatening to cloak criminal motives beneath apparitions and ghostly raps.\n\nThe narrative tension builds as Kennedy prepares to test the mediums and expose the human fraud behind the Vandam family’s mysterious spiritual encounters while simultaneously unraveling the enigma of Mrs. Vandam’s death. The interplay of forensic science, psychological insight, and deceptive spectacle promises a resolution where empirical proof confronts and dissects paranormal claims, inching closer to unveiling the truth hidden beneath the spiritualist masquerade.\n\nIn sum, the story’s third installment expands the initial medical and paranormal mystery into a broader investigation of deception, motive, and cunning. Key events—such as Kennedy’s laboratory analyses, the planning of a controlled séance with key players present, the secret possession of Vandam’s house keys by the medium and her manager, and the discovery of a magical workshop supplying illusion devices—forge a path toward exposing the orchestrated raps and fraudulent communications. These developments emphasize the detective’s commitment to rigorous scientific inquiry against the backdrop of grief, credulity, and calculated trickery."

It is the best way to get a good sitting, I believe. Can you do it?\"\nThe little man thought a moment, then replied: \"Si, signor yes—very nearly, near enough. I would do anything for Mrs. Popper. She is a good customer. But her manager—\"\n\"My friend here, Mr. Jameson, has had seances with her in her own apartment,\" interposed Craig. \"Perhaps he can help you to recollect just what is necessary.\"\n\"I know very well, signor. I have the duplicate bill, the bill which was paid by that Farrington with a check from the banker Vandam. Leave it to me.\"\n\"Then you will get the stuff together this morning and have it up to my place this afternoon.\"\n\"Yes, Professor, yes. It is a bargain. I would do anything for Mrs. Popper—she is a fine woman.\"\n\nLATE that afternoon I rejoined Craig at his laboratory. Signor Marina had already arrived with a truck and was disposing the paraphernalia about the laboratory. He had first laid a thick black rug. Mrs. Popper very much affected black carpets, and I had noticed that Vandam's room was carpeted in black, too. I suppose black conceals everything that one oughtn't to see at a seance.\nA cabinet with a black curtain, several chairs, a light deal table, several banjos, horns, and other instruments were disposed about the room. With a few suggestions from me we made a fair duplication of the hangings on the walls. Kennedy was manifestly anxious to finish, and at last it was done.\nAfter Marina had gone, Kennedy stretched a curtain over the end of the room farthest from the cabinet. Behind it he placed on a shelf the apparatus composed of the pendulums and magnets. The beakers and test-tubes were also on this shelf.\nHe had also arranged that the cabinet should be so situated that it was next a hallway that ran past his laboratory.\n\"To-night, Jameson,\" he said, indicating a spot on the hall wall just back of the cabinet, \"I shall want you to bring my guests out here and do a little spirit rapping—I'll tell you just what to do when the time comes.\"\n\nTHAT night, when we gathered in the transformed laboratory, there were Henry Vandam, Dr. Hanson, Inspector O'Connor, Kennedy, and myself. At last the sound of wheels was heard, and Mrs. Popper drove up in a hansom, accompanied by Farrington. They both inspected the room narrowly and seemed satisfied. I had, as I have said, taken a serious dislike to the man, and watched him closely. I did not like his air of calm assurance.\nThe lights were switched off, all except one sixteen-candle- power lamp in the farthest corner, shaded by a deep-red globe. It was just light enough to see to read very, large print with difficulty.\nMrs. Popper began immediately with the table. Kennedy and I sat on her right and left respectively, in the circle, and held her hands and feet. I confess to a real thrill when I felt the light table rise first on two legs, then on one, and finally remain suspended in the air, whence it dropped with a thud, as if someone had suddenly withdrawn his support.\nThe medium sat with her back to the curtain of the cabinet, and several times I could have sworn that a hand reached out and passed close to my head. At least it seemed so. The curtain bulged at times, and a breeze seemed to sweep out from the cabinet.\nAfter some time of this sort of work Craig led gradually up to a request for a materialisation of the control of Vandam, but Mrs. Popper refused. She said she did not feel strong enough, and Farrington put in a hasty word that he, too, could feel that \"there was something working against them.\" But Kennedy was importunate and at last she consented to see if \"John\" would do some rapping, even if he could not materialise.\nKennedy asked to be permitted to put the questions.\n\"Are you the 'John' who appears to Mr. Vandam every night at twelve-thirty?\"\nRap! rap! rap! came the faint reply from the cabinet. Or rather it seemed to me to come from the floor near the cabinet, and perhaps to be a trifle muffled by the black carpet.\n\"Are you in communication with Mrs. Vandam?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\n\"Can she be made to rap for us?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"Will you ask her a question and spell out her answer?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\nCraig paused a moment to frame the question, then shot it out point-blank: \"Does Mrs. Vandam know now in the other world whether anyone in this room substituted a morphine capsule for one of those ordered by her three days before she died? Does she know whether the same person has done the same thing with those later ordered by Mr. Vandam?\"\n\"John\" seemed considerably perturbed at the mention of capsules. It was a long time before any answer was forthcoming. Kennedy was about to repeat the question when a faint sound was heard.\nRap!——\n\nSUDDENLY came a wild scream. It was such a scream as I had never heard before in my life. It came as though a dagger had been thrust into the heart of Mrs. Popper. The lights flashed up as Kennedy turned the switch.\nA man was lying flat on the floor—it was Inspector O'Connor. He had succeeded in slipping noiselessly, like a snake, below the curtain into the cabinet. Craig had told him to look out for wires or threads stretched from Mrs. Popper's clothing to the bulging curtain of the cabinet. Imagine his surprise when he saw that she had simply freed her foot from the shoe, which I was carefully holding down, and with a backward movement of the leg was reaching out into the cabinet behind her chair and was doing the rapping with her toes.\nLying on the floor he had grasped her foot and caught her heel with a firm hand. She had responded with a wild yell that showed she knew she was trapped. Her secret was out.\nHysterically Mrs. Popper began to upbraid the inspector as he rose to his feet, but Farrington quickly interposed.\n\"Something was working against us to-night, gentlemen. Yet you demanded results. And when the spirits will not come, what is she to do? She forgets herself in her trance; she produces, herself, the things that you all could see supernaturally if you were in sympathy.\"\nThe mere sound of Farrington's voice seemed to rouse in me all the animosity of my nature. I felt that a man who could trump up an excuse like that when a person was caught with the goods was capable of almost anything.\n\"Enough of this fake seance,\" exclaimed Craig. \"I have let it go on merely for the purpose of opening the eyes of a certain deluded gentleman in this room.",

Or rather it seemed to me to come from the floor near the cabinet, and perhaps to be a trifle muffled by the black carpet.\n\"Are you in communication with Mrs. Vandam?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\n\"Can she be made to rap for us?\"\nRap! rap!\n\"Will you ask her a question and spell out her answer?\"\nRap! rap! rap!\nCraig paused a moment to frame the question, then shot it out point-blank: \"Does Mrs. Vandam know now in the other world whether anyone in this room substituted a morphine capsule for one of those ordered by her three days before she died? Does she know whether the same person has done the same thing with those later ordered by Mr. Vandam?\"\n\"John\" seemed considerably perturbed at the mention of capsules. It was a long time before any answer was forthcoming. Kennedy was about to repeat the question when a faint sound was heard.\nRap!——\n\nSUDDENLY came a wild scream. It was such a scream as I had never heard before in my life. It came as though a dagger had been thrust into the heart of Mrs. Popper. The lights flashed up as Kennedy turned the switch.\nA man was lying flat on the floor—it was Inspector O'Connor. He had succeeded in slipping noiselessly, like a snake, below the curtain into the cabinet. Craig had told him to look out for wires or threads stretched from Mrs. Popper's clothing to the bulging curtain of the cabinet. Imagine his surprise when he saw that she had simply freed her foot from the shoe, which I was carefully holding down, and with a backward movement of the leg was reaching out into the cabinet behind her chair and was doing the rapping with her toes.\nLying on the floor he had grasped her foot and caught her heel with a firm hand. She had responded with a wild yell that showed she knew she was trapped. Her secret was out.\nHysterically Mrs. Popper began to upbraid the inspector as he rose to his feet, but Farrington quickly interposed.\n\"Something was working against us to-night, gentlemen. Yet you demanded results. And when the spirits will not come, what is she to do? She forgets herself in her trance; she produces, herself, the things that you all could see supernaturally if you were in sympathy.\"\nThe mere sound of Farrington's voice seemed to rouse in me all the animosity of my nature. I felt that a man who could trump up an excuse like that when a person was caught with the goods was capable of almost anything.\n\"Enough of this fake seance,\" exclaimed Craig. \"I have let it go on merely for the purpose of opening the eyes of a certain deluded gentleman in this room.\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "“The Seismograph Adventure” is a richly layered detective tale that melds medical mystery, spiritualism, and scientific investigation surrounding the enigmatic death of Mrs. Vandam. Initially found unconscious in her affluent home and dying without regaining consciousness, her death’s cause is fiercely disputed among suicide, murder, and natural illness, all set against a backdrop of spiritualistic phenomena reported by her husband, Henry Vandam—a man obsessed with contacting spirits, especially his deceased wife’s.\n\nThe story is propelled by the methodical and scientifically minded detective Craig Kennedy, who combines cutting-edge technology with keen observation to scrutinize phenomena that Henry ardently attributes to spiritual communication. The peculiar “rap” sounds—knockings believed by Henry to be messages from his wife’s spirit or entities like the mysterious “John”—have dominated the home’s atmosphere, complicating the investigation. Kennedy’s alliance with Dr. James Hanson, the coroner’s physician, and Inspector O’Connor deepens the medical and investigative threads.\n\nEarly in the case, Dr. Hanson suspects a uremic coma due to kidney disease caused Mrs. Vandam’s death, though alternative theories of morphine poisoning and suicide surface. Kennedy approaches the claims skeptically, particularly the spiritualist manifestations, which he aims to demystify through scientific instrumentation. He employs a specially designed seismograph apparatus in the séance room to detect physical sources behind the ghostly raps. The device captures subtle mechanical movements from the hallway side of a cabinet during a séance, indicating a human origin of the tapping rather than supernatural causes.\n\nThe investigation’s stakes rise when it is revealed that the “ghost” prompted Henry to refill a prescription potentially tied to the medical mystery. Concerns emerge that someone is manufacturing spiritualistic communications to manipulate Henry—possibly for financial gain, as indicated by Henry’s lawyer discussing a new will with Inspector O’Connor. Kennedy safeguards a pillbox containing capsules that could contain poison and gathers ink samples for forensic analysis to detect document forgery.\n\nKennedy’s laboratory becomes the nexus for his probing into the fraud beneath the spiritualist veil. He enlists his friend Walter Jameson, a journalist who attended séances with Mrs. Popper, the medium, to observe her privately and prepare for a controlled séance at Kennedy’s lab involving scientific observers and Henry Vandam himself. Suspicion centers on Mrs. Popper’s manager, Howard Farrington, whose mercenary demeanor and close involvement with Mrs. Popper and the Vandam household raise red flags.\n\nFurther investigation reveals that both Mrs. Popper and Farrington hold keys to the Vandam residence and that continuous surveillance has detected no unauthorized entries or exits, pointing to early morning manipulations by the spiritualist charlatans. A pivotal discovery occurs when Kennedy visits Signor Marina, a craftsman of illusions who supplies materials and devices—such as tables, cabinets, curtains, and carpets—to spiritualists and magicians. Marina agrees to replicate exactly the séance paraphernalia used in Mrs. Popper’s sessions to recreate the conditions in Kennedy’s laboratory, thereby controlling and scientifically testing the alleged supernatural events.\n\nIn the final installment, Marina transports and arranges the duplicated séance furnishings—including black carpets, a curtain-covered cabinet, tables, and instruments—within Kennedy’s lab. Kennedy strategically positions his seismograph and chemical apparatus concealed behind a curtain adjacent to the cabinet and the adjacent hallway, where previous rapping was recorded. This experimental setup allows the team to observe the medium’s performance under closely monitored conditions.\n\nThat evening, the assembled group—Henry Vandam, Dr. Hanson, Inspector O’Connor, Kennedy, and Jameson—await Mrs. Popper and Farrington. Upon arrival, both inspect the laboratory-based séance room and appear satisfied with the duplication’s authenticity. The séance is conducted under dimmed lighting, with a single shaded lamp providing just enough glow to read large print, replicating the eerie ambiance conducive to spiritualist performances.\n\nMrs. Popper commences by “moving” a light table, which appears to levitate when she sits holding its legs, thrilling those present. Subtle movements and bulgings behind the cabinet’s curtain, along with breezes seeming to emanate from it, create an atmosphere ripe with illusion. Kennedy pushes the medium to connect with “John,” the spirit who supposedly contacts Henry Vandam nightly. Though initially reluctant to attempt a materialisation—claiming weakness, and Farrington echoing that “something worked against them”—Mrs. Popper ultimately agrees to spirit rapping.\n\nWhen Kennedy interrogates the spirit regarding whether Mrs. Vandam’s morphine capsules were tampered with and if later capsules ordered by Henry were switched, the rapping falters, and an uneasy pause ensues. At that tense moment, a piercing scream shatters the séance’s eerie stillness. Inspector O’Connor, who had covertly slipped behind the curtain, reveals the deception: Mrs. Popper had freed her foot from beneath the table and was using her toes to tap against the cabinet, producing the purported spirit raps.\n\nCaught red-handed, Mrs. Popper shrieks and lashes out, hysterically accusing the inspector even as Farrington attempts to rationalize the exposure by blaming adverse spiritual interference and claiming the medium’s trance caused her to produce phenomena subconsciously. Kennedy promptly denounces the séance as a fraud orchestrated to deceive Henry Vandam and the others, abruptly ending the performance.\n\nThis climactic revelation crystallizes the story’s central theme—the conflict between rational scientific inquiry and emotional/spiritual credulity. Kennedy’s meticulous preparations and scientific devices, combined with the exposure of trickery, pierce the veil of superstition enveloping the Vandam household. It becomes clear that the “ghostly” rappings and séances were human fabrications designed to manipulate Henry, likely tied to financial motives as suggested by the brewing will contest and suspicious intermediaries like Farrington.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the interplay of meticulous forensic analysis, medical skepticism, and psychological insight exposes how grief and belief can be weaponized by charlatans using illusion and mechanized trickery. Kennedy’s deployment of replicated environment, recording instruments, and chemical tests embodies a rigorous, empirical approach to unmasking deception buried beneath layers of theatrical spiritualism.\n\nIn summary, “The Seismograph Adventure” evolves from a mysterious medical death into a compelling detective examination of human motives cloaked in paranormal spectacle. The fourth segment’s séance reenactment and unmasking of Mrs. Popper as the source of the “spirit” rappings finalize Kennedy’s scientific vindication against fraudulent supernatural claims. The resolution underscores the story’s central tenet: that technology and reason can unravel mysteries compounded by emotion, grief, and cunning, revealing truth behind the spectral masquerade."
