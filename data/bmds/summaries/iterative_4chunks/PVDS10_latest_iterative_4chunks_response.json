      "chunk_text": "WITH coffee cup daintily poised in one hand, Mrs. Lingard van Safford lifted wistful, bewitching eyes towards her husband, who sat across the breakfast table partially immersed in the morning papers.\n\"Are you going out this morning?\" she inquired.\nMr. van Safford grunted inarticulately.\n\"May I inquire,\" she went on placidly, and a dimple snuggled at a corner of her mouth, \"if that particular grunt means that you are or are not?\"\nMr. van Safford lowered his newspaper and glanced at his wife's pretty face. She smiled charmingly.\n\"Really, I beg your pardon,\" he apologized, \"I hardly think I will go out. I feel rather listless, and I must write some letters. Why?\"\n\"Oh, nothing particularly,\" she responded.\nShe took a last sip of her coffee, brushed two or three tiny crumbs from her lap, laid her napkin aside, and arose. Once she turned and glanced back; Mr. van Safford was reading again.\nAfter a while he finished the papers and stood looking out a window, yawning prodigiously at the prospect of letters to be written. His wife entered and picked up a handkerchief which had fallen beside her chair. He merely glanced around. She was dressed for the street—immaculately, stunningly gowned as only a young and beautiful and wealthy woman can gown herself.\n\"Where are you going, my dear?\" he inquired, languidly.\n\"Out,\" she responded archly.\nShe passed through the door. He heard her step and the rustle of her skirts in the hall, then he heard the front door open and close. For some reason, not quite clear even to himself, it surprised him; she had never done a thing like that before. He walked to the front window and looked out. His wife went straight down the street, and turned the first corner. After a time he wandered away to the library to nurse an emotion he had never felt before. It was curiosity.\nMRS. VAN SAFFORD did not return home for luncheon, so he sat down alone. Afterwards he mouched about the house restlessly for an hour or so, then he went down town. He appeared at home again just in time to dress for dinner.\n\"Has Mrs. van Safford returned?\" was his first question of Baxter, who opened the door.\n\"Yes, sir, half an hour ago,\" responded Baxter. \"She's dressing.\"\nMr. van Safford ran up the steps to his own apartments. At dinner his wife was radiant, rosily radiant. The flush of perfect health was in her checks and her eyes sparkled beneath their long lashes. She smiled brilliantly upon her husband. To him it was all as if some great thing had been taken out of his life, leaving it desolate, then as suddenly returned. Unnamed emotions struggled within him prompted by that curiosity of the morning, and a dozen questions hammered insistently for answers, But he repressed them gallantly, and for this he was duly rewarded.\n\"I had such a delightful time today!\" his wife exclaimed, after the soup. \"I called for Mrs. Blacklock immediately after I left here, and we were together all day shopping. We had luncheon down town.\"\nOh! That was it! Mr. van Safford laughed outright from a vague sense of relief which he could not have called by name, and toasted his wife silently by lifting his glass. Her eyes sparkled at the compliment. He drained the glass, snapped the slender stem in his fingers, laughed again and laid it aside. Mrs. van Safford dimpled with sheer delight.\n\"Oh, Van, you silly boy!\" she reproved softly, and she stroked the hand which was prosaically reaching for the salt.\nIT was only a little while after dinner that Mr. van Safford excused himself and started for the club, as usual. His wife followed him demurely to the door and there, under the goggling eyes of Baxter, he caught her in his arms and kissed her impetuously, fiercely even. It was the sudden outbreak of an impulsive nature—the sort of thing that makes a woman know she is loved. She thrilled at his touch and reached two white hands forward pleadingly. Then the door closed, and she stood staring down at the tip of her tiny boot with lowered lids and a little, melancholy droop at the corners of her mouth.\nIT was after ten o'clock when Mr. van Safford awoke on the following morning. He had been at his club late—until after two—and now drowsily permitted himself to be overcome again by the languid listlessness which is the heritage of late hours. At ten minutes past eleven he appeared in the breakfast room.\n\"Mrs. van Safford has been down I suppose?\" he inquired of a maid.\n\"Oh yes, sir,\" she replied. \"She's gone out.\"\nMr. van Safford lifted his brows inquiringly.\n\"She was down a few minutes after eight o'clock, sir,\" the maid explained, \"and hurried through her breakfast.\"\n\"Did she leave any word?\"\n\"No, sir.\"\n\"Be back to luncheon?\"\n\"She didn't say, sir.\"\nMr. van Safford finished his breakfast silently and thoughtfully. About noon he, too, went out. One of the first persons he met down town was Mrs. Blacklock, and she rushed toward him with outstretched hand.\n\"I'm so glad to see you,\" she bubbled, for Mrs. Blacklock was of that rare type which can bubble becomingly. \"But where, in the name of goodness, is your wife? I haven't seen her for weeks and weeks?\"\n\"Haven't seen her for—\" Mr. van Safford repeated, slowly.\n\"No,\" Mrs. Blacklock assured him. \"I can't imagine where she is keeping herself.\"\nMr. van Safford gazed at her in dumb bewilderment for a moment, and the lines about his mouth hardened a little despite his efforts to control himself.\n\"I had an impression,\" he said deliberately, \"that you saw her yesterday—that you went shopping together?\"\n\"Goodness, no. It must be three weeks since I saw her.\"\nMr. van Safford's fingers closed slowly, fiercely, but his face relaxed a little, masking with a slight smile, a turbulent rush of mingled emotions.\n\"She mentioned your name,\" he said at last, calmly. \"Perhaps she said she was going to call on you. I misunderstood her.\"\nHe didn't remember the remainder of the conversation, but it was of no consequence at the moment. He had not misunderstood her, and he knew he had not. At last he found himself at his club, and there idle guesses and conjectures flowed through his brain in an unending stream. Finally he arose, grimly.\n\"I suppose I'm an ass,\" he mused. \"It doesn't amount to anything, of course, but—\"\nAnd he sought to rid himself of distracting thoughts over a game of billiards; instead he only subjected himself to open derision for glaringly inaccurate play. Finally he flung down the cue in disgust, strode away to the 'phone and called up his home.\n\"Is Mrs. van Safford there?\" he inquired of Baxter.\n\"No, sir. She hasn't returned yet.\"\nMR. VAN SAFFORD banged the telephone viciously as he hung up the receiver. At six o'clock he returned home. His wife was still out. At half past eight he sat down to dinner, alone. He didn't enjoy it; indeed hardly tasted it. Then, just as he finished, she came in with a rush of skirts and a lilt of laughter. He drew a long breath, and set his teeth.\n\"You poor, deserted dear!\" she sympathized, laughingly.\nHe started to say something, but two soft, clinging arms were about his neck, and a velvety cheek rested against his own, so—so he kissed her instead. And really he wasn't at all to be blamed. She sighed happily, and laid aside her hat and gloves.\n\"I simply couldn't get here any sooner,\" she explained poutingly as she glanced into his accusing eyes. \"I was out with Nell Blakesley in her big, new touring car, and it broke down and we had to send for a man to repair it, so—\"\nHe didn't hear the rest; he was staring into her eyes, steadily, inquiringly. Truth shone triumphant there; he could only believe her. Yet—yet—that other thing! She hadn't told him the truth! In her face, at last, he read uneasiness as he continued to stare, and for a moment there was silence.\n\"What's the matter, Van?\" she inquired solicitously. \"Don't you feel well?\"\nHe pulled himself together with a start and for a time they chatted of inconsequential things as she ate. He watched her until she pushed her dessert plate aside, then casually, quite casually:\n\"I believe you said you were going to call on Mrs. Blacklock tomorrow?\"\nShe looked up quickly.\n\"Oh no,\" she replied. \"I was with her all day yesterday, shopping. I said I had called on her.\"",

      "summary": "The opening segment of the detective story \"The Problem of the Green-Eyed Monster\" introduces the domestic life of Mr. and Mrs. Lingard van Safford, setting a tone of subtle tension underneath a seemingly genteel surface. The narrative unfolds primarily from the perspective of Mr. van Safford, revealing his growing curiosity and unease regarding his wife’s recent unusual behavior.\n\nThe story begins one morning at the van Safford household during breakfast. Mrs. van Safford, portrayed as exquisitely beautiful, youthful, and wealthy, gracefully sips her coffee while engaging her husband in light conversation. She inquires whether he plans to go out that morning, but Mr. van Safford responds only with a vague grunt, seeming indifferent or noncommittal. His lack of enthusiasm is explained by a feeling of listlessness and a need to write letters at home. Mrs. van Safford appears unconcerned, finishing her coffee and preparing to leave—but unexpectedly for Mr. van Safford, she departs the house fully dressed to go out into the street, an action she had never taken before without him or without notice.\n\nHis curiosity is piqued as he watches her walking down the street and turning a corner. This departure from their usual routine unsettles him, stirring an unfamiliar and restless emotion. Mr. van Safford spends the day alone, noting with some anxiety that his wife does not return for lunch. He wanders the house restlessly before eventually going downtown. Yet despite his efforts, he returns home only to find that Mrs. van Safford has come back half an hour earlier and is preparing for dinner.\n\nAt the evening meal, Mrs. van Safford radiates joy and health, her appearance marked by a rosy glow and sparkling eyes. She beams at her husband, who feels a complex mixture of relief, affection, and unsettled curiosity. She eagerly recounts that after leaving the house that morning, she had called on Mrs. Blacklock, a friend, and spent the day shopping with her, including lunch downtown. Mr. van Safford laughs with relief, or at least a sense of reassurance, silently toasting his wife with his glass. Mrs. van Safford chides him affectionately for his suspicions, a gesture that momentarily dispels his misgivings.\n\nLater that evening, before Mr. van Safford leaves for the club, a sudden surge of passion prompts him to impulsively and fiercely embrace and kiss his wife at the door. The gesture is unexpected and intense, and his wife responds with a mixture of thrill and submission. Yet once he departs, she withdraws, looking down with a hint of melancholy, revealing a subtle emotional undercurrent contrasting the outward warmth between them.\n\nThe following morning, Mr. van Safford awakens late after staying out late at his club. He learns from a maid that his wife has been downstairs earlier but left hurriedly without leaving word and has not indicated when she might return. His suspicion deepens as she again goes out without explanation. His day grows increasingly anxious as he encounters Mrs. Blacklock downtown and is surprised when she expresses that she hasn’t seen Mrs. van Safford for weeks, contradicting what his wife had told him the day before about their supposedly recent shopping outing together.\n\nThis revelation puzzles and disturbs Mr. van Safford. His emotions oscillate between bewilderment and restrained anger. He struggles to reconcile Mrs. Blacklock’s claim with the story his wife had told. Attempting to maintain composure, he masks his feelings with a slight smile but internally tightens his grip on truth and logic. With a sense of growing agitation, he returns to the club to occupy his mind, only to perform poorly at billiards due to distraction and frustration. Afterward, he calls home by telephone, seeking news of his wife, only to be told she has not returned.\n\nAs evening falls and he dines alone, Mrs. van Safford finally arrives amid laughter and apparent cheerfulness. She dismisses his concern with a lighthearted excuse that she had been out driving with Nell Blakesley, whose touring car broke down, delaying her. Mr. van Safford finds himself caught between belief and suspicion, observing uneasiness in her expression despite her professed innocence. Although uncertain, he chooses to accept her explanation outwardly, though a lingering sense of mistrust remains.\n\nContinuing the conversation, he casually asks if she plans to visit Mrs. Blacklock the next day, only for her to correct him and say that she was with Mrs. Blacklock all day yesterday—directly contradicting his earlier conversation with Mrs. Blacklock, who claimed not to have seen Mrs. van Safford for weeks.\n\nThis segment effectively paints a picture of growing domestic mystery and emotional tension. Mr. van Safford’s initial listlessness and carefree attitude give way to growing suspicion and restlessness, provoked by his wife’s inexplicable absences and contradictory accounts. Mrs. van Safford is portrayed as charming and affectionate, yet her behavior harbors an elusive secrecy that unsettles her husband. The narrative leverages subtle emotional cues—glances, silences, and contradictions in speech—to heighten the sense of intrigue and doubt. Mr. van Safford’s inner turmoil—fluctuating between affection, trust, suspicion, and confusion—serves as a driving force for the unfolding mystery.\n\nThemes of jealousy, trust, and deception are introduced through the interaction between the couple, particularly with the enigmatic figure of Mrs. Blacklock acting as a critical link that exposes inconsistencies. The juxtaposition of mundane daily routines with subtle hints of deception compels the reader to question appearances and anticipate further revelations. Mr. van Safford’s \"green-eyed monster\" of jealousy is only beginning to manifest, presented with psychological realism and restraint.\n\nOverall, this first segment skillfully sets the stage for a detective narrative rooted in interpersonal relationships and emotional complexity. The reader is invited into a domestic world that at first seems ordinary but is clearly fractured beneath the surface, promising an unfolding mystery centered on Mrs. van Safford’s secretive conduct and Mr. van Safford’s quest for truth and reassurance. The story establishes a compelling psychological tension infused with subtle clues and social nuances that suggest deeper drama to come."

      "chunk_text": "Mr. van Safford arose suddenly, stood glaring down at her for an instant, then turning abruptly left the house. Involuntarily she had started up, then she sat down again and wept softly over her coffee. Mr. van Safford seemed to have a very definite purpose for when he reached the club he went straight to a telephone booth, and called Miss Blakesley over the wire.\n\"My wife said something about—something about—\" he stammered lamely, \"something about calling on you tomorrow. Will you be in?\"\n\"Yes, and I'll be so glad to see her,\" came the reply. \"I'm dreadfully tired of staying cooped up here in the house, and really I was beginning to think all my friends had deserted me.\"\n\"Cooped up in the house?\" Mr. van Safford repeated. \"Are you ill?\"\n\"I have been,\" replied Miss Blakesley. \"I'm better now, but I haven't been out of the house for more than a week.\"\n\"Indeed!\" remarked Mr. van Safford, sympathetically. \"I'm awfully sorry, I assure you. Then you haven't had a chance to try your—your—'big new touring car'?\"\n\"Why, I haven't any new touring car,\" said Miss Blakesley. \"I haven't any sort of a car. Where did you get that idea?\"\nMr. van Safford didn't answer her; rudely enough he hung up the telephone and left the club with a face like marble. When finally he stopped walking he was opposite his own house. For a minute he stood looking at it much as if he had never seen it before, then he turned and went back to the club. There was something of fright, of horror even, in his white face when he entered.\nAS Mr. van Safford did not go to bed that night it was not surprising that his wife should find him in the breakfast room when she came down about eight o'clock. She smiled. He stared at her with a curt: \"Good morning!\" Then came an ominous silence. She finished her breakfast, arose and left the house without a word. He watched her from a window until she disappeared around the corner, just four doors below, then overcome by fears, suspicions, hideous possibilities, he ran out of the house after her.\nShe had not been out of his sight more than half a minute when he reached the corner, yet now—now she was gone. He looked on both sides of the street, up and down, but there was no sign of her—not a woman in sight. He knew that she would not have had time to reach the next street below, then he readily saw the two obvious possibilities. One was that she had stepped into a waiting cab and been driven away at full speed; another that she had entered one of the nearby houses. If so, which house? Who did she know in this street? He turned the problem over in his mind several times, and then he was convinced that she had hurried away in waiting cab. That emotion which had begun as curiosity was now a raging, turbulent torrent.\nON the following morning Mrs. van Safford came down to breakfast at fifteen minutes of eight. She seemed a little tired, and there was a trace of tears about her eyes. Baxter looked at her curiously.\n\"Has Mr. van Safford been down yet?\" she asked.\n\"No, Madam,\" he replied.\n\"Did he come in at all last night?\"\n\"Yes, Madam. About half past two, I let him in. He had forgotten his key.\"\nNow as a matter of fact at that particular moment Mr. van Safford was standing just around the corner, four doors down, waiting for his wife. Just what he intended to do when she appeared was not quite clear in his mind, but the affair had gone to a point where he felt that he must do something. So he waited impatiently, and smoked innumerable cigars. Two hours passed. He glanced around the corner. No one in sight. He strolled back to the house, and met Baxter in the hall.\n\"Has Mrs. van Safford come down?\" he asked of the servant.\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the reply. \"She went out more than an hour ago.\"\nMARTHA opened the door.\n\"Please, sir,\" she said, \"there's a young gentleman having a fit in the reception room.\"\nProfessor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen—The Thinking Machine—turned away from his laboratory table and squinted at her aggressively. Her eyes were distended with nervous excitement, and her wrinkled hands twisted the apron she wore.\n\"Having a fit?\" snapped the scientist.\n\"Yes, sir,\" she gasped.\n\"Dear me! Dear me! How annoying!\" expostulated the man of achievement, petulantly. \"Just what sort of a fit is it—epileptic, apoplectic, or merely a fit of laughter?\"\n\"Lord, sir, I don't know,\" Martha confessed helplessly. \"He's just a-walking and a-talking and a-pulling his hair, sir.\"\n\"What name?\"\n\"I—I forgot to ask, sir,\" apologized the aged servant, \"it surprised me so to see a gentleman a-wiggling like that. He said, though he'd been to Police Headquarters and Detective Mallory sent him.\"\nThe eminent logician dried his hands and started for the reception room. At the door he paused and peered in. With no knowledge of just what style of fit his visitor had chosen to have he felt the necessity of this caution. What he saw was not alarming—merely a good-looking young man pacing back and forth across the room with quick, savage stride. His eyes were blazing, and his face was flushed with anger. It was Mr. van Safford.\nAt sight of the diminutive figure of The Thinking Machine, topped by the enormous yellow head, the young man paused and his anger-distorted features relaxed into something closely approaching surprise.\n\"Well?\" demanded The Thinking Machine, querulously.\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. van Safford with a slight start. \"I—I had expected to find a—a—rather a different sort of person.\"\n\"Yes, I know,\" said The Thinking Machine grumpily. \"A man with a black moustache and big feet. Sit down.\"\nMr. van Safford sat down rather suddenly. It never occurred to anyone to do other than obey when the crabbed little scientist spoke. Then, with an incoherence which was thoroughly convincing, Mr. van Safford laid before The Thinking Machine in detail those singular happenings which had so disturbed him. The Thinking Machine leaned back in his chair, with finger tips pressed together, and listened to the end.\n\"My mental condition—my suffering—was such,\" explained Mr. van Safford in conclusion, \"that when I proved to my own satisfaction that she had twice misrepresented the facts to me, wilfully, I—I could have strangled her.\"\n\"That would have been a nice thing to do,\" remarked the scientist crustily. \"You believe, then, that there may be another—\"\n\"Don't say it,\" burst out the young man passionately. He arose. His face was dead white. \"Don't say it,\" he repeated, menacingly.\nThe Thinking Machine was silent a moment, then glanced up in the blazing eyes and cleared his throat.\n\"She never did such a thing before?\" he asked.\n\"No, never.\"\n\"Does she—did she—ever speculate?\"\nMr. van Safford sat down again.\n\"Never,\" he responded, positively. \"She wouldn't know one stock from another.\"\n\"Has her own bank account?\"\n\"Yes—nearly four hundred thousand dollars. This was her father's gift at our wedding. It was deposited in her name, and has remained so. My own income is more than enough for our uses.\"\n\"You are rich, then?\"\n\"My father left me nearly two million dollars,\" was the reply. \"But this all doesn't matter. What I want—\"\n\"Wait a minute,\" interrupted The Thinking Machine testily. There was a long pause. \"You have never quarrelled seriously?\"\n\"Never one cross word,\" was the reply.\n\"Remarkable,\" commented The Thinking Machine ambiguously. \"How long have you been married?\"\n\"Two years—last June.\"\n\"Most remarkable,\" supplemented the scientist. Mr. van Safford stared. \"How old are you?\"\n\"Thirty.\"\n\"How long have you been thirty?\"",

She beams at her husband, who feels a complex mixture of relief, affection, and unsettled curiosity. She eagerly recounts that after leaving the house that morning, she had called on Mrs. Blacklock, a friend, and spent the day shopping with her, including lunch downtown. Mr. van Safford laughs with relief, or at least a sense of reassurance, silently toasting his wife with his glass. Mrs. van Safford chides him affectionately for his suspicions, a gesture that momentarily dispels his misgivings.\n\nLater that evening, before Mr. van Safford leaves for the club, a sudden surge of passion prompts him to impulsively and fiercely embrace and kiss his wife at the door. The gesture is unexpected and intense, and his wife responds with a mixture of thrill and submission. Yet once he departs, she withdraws, looking down with a hint of melancholy, revealing a subtle emotional undercurrent contrasting the outward warmth between them.\n\nThe following morning, Mr. van Safford awakens late after staying out late at his club. He learns from a maid that his wife has been downstairs earlier but left hurriedly without leaving word and has not indicated when she might return. His suspicion deepens as she again goes out without explanation. His day grows increasingly anxious as he encounters Mrs. Blacklock downtown and is surprised when she expresses that she hasn’t seen Mrs. van Safford for weeks, contradicting what his wife had told him the day before about their supposedly recent shopping outing together.\n\nThis revelation puzzles and disturbs Mr. van Safford. His emotions oscillate between bewilderment and restrained anger. He struggles to reconcile Mrs. Blacklock’s claim with the story his wife had told. Attempting to maintain composure, he masks his feelings with a slight smile but internally tightens his grip on truth and logic. With a sense of growing agitation, he returns to the club to occupy his mind, only to perform poorly at billiards due to distraction and frustration. Afterward, he calls home by telephone, seeking news of his wife, only to be told she has not returned.\n\nAs evening falls and he dines alone, Mrs. van Safford finally arrives amid laughter and apparent cheerfulness. She dismisses his concern with a lighthearted excuse that she had been out driving with Nell Blakesley, whose touring car broke down, delaying her. Mr. van Safford finds himself caught between belief and suspicion, observing uneasiness in her expression despite her professed innocence. Although uncertain, he chooses to accept her explanation outwardly, though a lingering sense of mistrust remains.\n\nContinuing the conversation, he casually asks if she plans to visit Mrs. Blacklock the next day, only for her to correct him and say that she was with Mrs. Blacklock all day yesterday—directly contradicting his earlier conversation with Mrs. Blacklock, who claimed not to have seen Mrs. van Safford for weeks.\n\nThis segment effectively paints a picture of growing domestic mystery and emotional tension. Mr. van Safford’s initial listlessness and carefree attitude give way to growing suspicion and restlessness, provoked by his wife’s inexplicable absences and contradictory accounts. Mrs. van Safford is portrayed as charming and affectionate, yet her behavior harbors an elusive secrecy that unsettles her husband. The narrative leverages subtle emotional cues—glances, silences, and contradictions in speech—to heighten the sense of intrigue and doubt. Mr. van Safford’s inner turmoil—fluctuating between affection, trust, suspicion, and confusion—serves as a driving force for the unfolding mystery.\n\nThemes of jealousy, trust, and deception are introduced through the interaction between the couple, particularly with the enigmatic figure of Mrs. Blacklock acting as a critical link that exposes inconsistencies. The juxtaposition of mundane daily routines with subtle hints of deception compels the reader to question appearances and anticipate further revelations. Mr. van Safford’s \"green-eyed monster\" of jealousy is only beginning to manifest, presented with psychological realism and restraint.\n\nOverall, this first segment skillfully sets the stage for a detective narrative rooted in interpersonal relationships and emotional complexity. The reader is invited into a domestic world that at first seems ordinary but is clearly fractured beneath the surface, promising an unfolding mystery centered on Mrs. van Safford’s secretive conduct and Mr. van Safford’s quest for truth and reassurance. The story establishes a compelling psychological tension infused with subtle clues and social nuances that suggest deeper drama to come.\n\nCurrent segment (part 2):\nMr. van Safford arose suddenly, stood glaring down at her for an instant, then turning abruptly left the house. Involuntarily she had started up, then she sat down again and wept softly over her coffee. Mr. van Safford seemed to have a very definite purpose for when he reached the club he went straight to a telephone booth, and called Miss Blakesley over the wire.\n\"My wife said something about—something about—\" he stammered lamely, \"something about calling on you tomorrow. Will you be in?\"\n\"Yes, and I'll be so glad to see her,\" came the reply. \"I'm dreadfully tired of staying cooped up here in the house, and really I was beginning to think all my friends had deserted me.\"\n\"Cooped up in the house?\" Mr. van Safford repeated. \"Are you ill?\"\n\"I have been,\" replied Miss Blakesley. \"I'm better now, but I haven't been out of the house for more than a week.\"\n\"Indeed!\" remarked Mr. van Safford, sympathetically. \"I'm awfully sorry, I assure you. Then you haven't had a chance to try your—your—'big new touring car'?\"\n\"Why, I haven't any new touring car,\" said Miss Blakesley. \"I haven't any sort of a car. Where did you get that idea?\"\nMr. van Safford didn't answer her; rudely enough he hung up the telephone and left the club with a face like marble. When finally he stopped walking he was opposite his own house. For a minute he stood looking at it much as if he had never seen it before, then he turned and went back to the club. There was something of fright, of horror even, in his white face when he entered.\nAS Mr. van Safford did not go to bed that night it was not surprising that his wife should find him in the breakfast room when she came down about eight o'clock. She smiled. He stared at her with a curt: \"Good morning!\" Then came an ominous silence. She finished her breakfast, arose and left the house without a word. He watched her from a window until she disappeared around the corner, just four doors below, then overcome by fears, suspicions, hideous possibilities, he ran out of the house after her.\nShe had not been out of his sight more than half a minute when he reached the corner, yet now—now she was gone. He looked on both sides of the street, up and down, but there was no sign of her—not a woman in sight. He knew that she would not have had time to reach the next street below, then he readily saw the two obvious possibilities. One was that she had stepped into a waiting cab and been driven away at full speed; another that she had entered one of the nearby houses. If so, which house? Who did she know in this street? He turned the problem over in his mind several times, and then he was convinced that she had hurried away in waiting cab. That emotion which had begun as curiosity was now a raging, turbulent torrent.\nON the following morning Mrs. van Safford came down to breakfast at fifteen minutes of eight. She seemed a little tired, and there was a trace of tears about her eyes. Baxter looked at her curiously.\n\"Has Mr. van Safford been down yet?\" she asked.\n\"No, Madam,\" he replied.\n\"Did he come in at all last night?\"\n\"Yes, Madam. About half past two, I let him in. He had forgotten his key.\"\nNow as a matter of fact at that particular moment Mr. van Safford was standing just around the corner, four doors down, waiting for his wife. Just what he intended to do when she appeared was not quite clear in his mind, but the affair had gone to a point where he felt that he must do something. So he waited impatiently, and smoked innumerable cigars. Two hours passed. He glanced around the corner. No one in sight. He strolled back to the house, and met Baxter in the hall.\n\"Has Mrs. van Safford come down?\" he asked of the servant.\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the reply. \"She went out more than an hour ago.\"\nMARTHA opened the door.\n\"Please, sir,\" she said, \"there's a young gentleman having a fit in the reception room.\"\nProfessor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen—The Thinking Machine—turned away from his laboratory table and squinted at her aggressively. Her eyes were distended with nervous excitement, and her wrinkled hands twisted the apron she wore.\n\"Having a fit?\" snapped the scientist.\n\"Yes, sir,\" she gasped.\n\"Dear me! Dear me! How annoying!\" expostulated the man of achievement, petulantly. \"Just what sort of a fit is it—epileptic, apoplectic, or merely a fit of laughter?\"\n\"Lord, sir, I don't know,\" Martha confessed helplessly. \"He's just a-walking and a-talking and a-pulling his hair, sir.\"\n\"What name?\"\n\"I—I forgot to ask, sir,\" apologized the aged servant, \"it surprised me so to see a gentleman a-wiggling like that. He said, though he'd been to Police Headquarters and Detective Mallory sent him.\"\nThe eminent logician dried his hands and started for the reception room. At the door he paused and peered in. With no knowledge of just what style of fit his visitor had chosen to have he felt the necessity of this caution. What he saw was not alarming—merely a good-looking young man pacing back and forth across the room with quick, savage stride. His eyes were blazing, and his face was flushed with anger. It was Mr. van Safford.\nAt sight of the diminutive figure of The Thinking Machine, topped by the enormous yellow head, the young man paused and his anger-distorted features relaxed into something closely approaching surprise.\n\"Well?\" demanded The Thinking Machine, querulously.\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. van Safford with a slight start. \"I—I had expected to find a—a—rather a different sort of person.\"\n\"Yes, I know,\" said The Thinking Machine grumpily. \"A man with a black moustache and big feet. Sit down.\"\nMr. van Safford sat down rather suddenly. It never occurred to anyone to do other than obey when the crabbed little scientist spoke. Then, with an incoherence which was thoroughly convincing, Mr. van Safford laid before The Thinking Machine in detail those singular happenings which had so disturbed him. The Thinking Machine leaned back in his chair, with finger tips pressed together, and listened to the end.\n\"My mental condition—my suffering—was such,\" explained Mr. van Safford in conclusion, \"that when I proved to my own satisfaction that she had twice misrepresented the facts to me, wilfully, I—I could have strangled her.\"\n\"That would have been a nice thing to do,\" remarked the scientist crustily. \"You believe, then, that there may be another—\"\n\"Don't say it,\" burst out the young man passionately. He arose. His face was dead white. \"Don't say it,\" he repeated, menacingly.\nThe Thinking Machine was silent a moment, then glanced up in the blazing eyes and cleared his throat.\n\"She never did such a thing before?\" he asked.\n\"No, never.\"\n\"Does she—did she—ever speculate?\"\nMr. van Safford sat down again.\n\"Never,\" he responded, positively. \"She wouldn't know one stock from another.\"\n\"Has her own bank account?\"\n\"Yes—nearly four hundred thousand dollars. This was her father's gift at our wedding. It was deposited in her name, and has remained so. My own income is more than enough for our uses.\"\n\"You are rich, then?\"\n\"My father left me nearly two million dollars,\" was the reply. \"But this all doesn't matter. What I want—\"\n\"Wait a minute,\" interrupted The Thinking Machine testily. There was a long pause. \"You have never quarrelled seriously?\"\n\"Never one cross word,\" was the reply.\n\"Remarkable,\" commented The Thinking Machine ambiguously. \"How long have you been married?\"\n\"Two years—last June.\"\n\"Most remarkable,\" supplemented the scientist. Mr. van Safford stared. \"How old are you?\"\n\"Thirty.\"\n\"How long have you been thirty?\"\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "“The Problem of the Green-Eyed Monster” is a psychological detective story that intricately explores themes of jealousy, trust, and deception set within the seemingly serene domestic life of Mr. and Mrs. Lingard van Safford. The narrative unfolds primarily from Mr. van Safford’s perspective, capturing his growing suspicion, emotional turmoil, and quest for truth in response to his wife’s increasingly enigmatic behavior.\n\nThe tale opens during a typical morning breakfast in the van Safford household, where Mrs. van Safford, a strikingly beautiful and youthful woman of considerable wealth, deviates from her usual routine by leaving the house abruptly and alone—something she had never done without informing her husband or accompanying him. This peculiarity unsettles Mr. van Safford, stirring unfamiliar feelings of unease and stirring curiosity that soon burgeons into a restless preoccupation. His day is marked by anxious anticipation as he notes her prolonged absence and contradictory explanations regarding her whereabouts, further complicated by an encounter with Mrs. Blacklock, a friend of Mrs. van Safford’s, who claims not to have seen her for weeks, contradicting the story his wife had told.\n\nMrs. van Safford’s behavior oscillates between warmth and evasiveness. After a day apart, she returns radiant yet somewhat weary, offering different versions of her activities that seem inconsistent to Mr. van Safford. Despite her charm and attempts to reassure him, the undercurrent of secrecy creates a growing rift of suspicion in his mind. The tension culminates with Mr. van Safford’s impulsive display of passionate affection at the door when leaving for his club, a gesture that his wife receives with a mixture of thrill and melancholy—highlighting the emotional complexity beneath their marital veneer.\n\nIn the segment that follows, Mr. van Safford’s internal conflict intensifies sharply. One morning, after a terse and charged exchange, he abruptly storms out, leaving Mrs. van Safford visibly shaken and tearful. She sits alone, weeping quietly over her coffee, underscoring the emotional toll her husband’s suspicion and temper are exacting. Mr. van Safford, determined to find answers, immediately seeks to verify one of his wife’s claims by calling Nell Blakesley, a supposed acquaintance his wife mentioned having gone out with. The phone conversation reveals shocking truths: Miss Blakesley has not only been ill and confined indoors but also denies owning any touring car, directly refuting Mrs. van Safford’s account of a car journey with her. The call ends abruptly with Mr. van Safford’s mood turning to one of frozen fury and profound disquiet.\n\nThis discovery forces Mr. van Safford to view his own home and life through alien eyes, as he stands outside his house, feeling estranged from his surroundings. The doubt hardens, and he returns to the club agitated and pale as death, consumed by fears and treacherous thoughts. The following days deepen his suspicion: Mrs. van Safford leaves the house early but disappears shortly after he follows her, vanishing from sight in a brief moment. Mr. van Safford is left to speculate whether she escaped in a waiting cab or entered one of several neighboring houses unknown to him—both options suggesting secretive, possibly deceptive conduct.\n\nDespite his fears, life at home remains outwardly normal. The morning after Mr. van Safford’s tense pursuit, Mrs. van Safford appears weary, with red eyes betraying recent tears, while their servant confirms Mr. van Safford’s late return home but she has already left early. His anxious vigil outside the house goes unanswered as she fails to reappear for hours, compounding his despair and need to involve others.\n\nAt this critical juncture, Mr. van Safford turns to the renowned Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, known as The Thinking Machine, for assistance. Van Dusen’s entrance offers a contrast: diminutive, curt, and petulant, his sharp intellect and skeptical demeanor foreshadow a logical deconstruction of the emotional chaos. The meeting begins with The Thinking Machine’s impatient questioning of Mr. van Safford’s agitated behavior, likening it to a “fit” of some kind. Mr. van Safford, initially surprised by the scientist’s unassuming appearance and brusque manner, recounts in detail the troubling incidents—the contradictory stories, his wife’s secretiveness, and his own mental anguish that almost drove him to violence.\n\nThe dialogue between the two men sheds light on essential background facts. Mr. van Safford insists that his wife is not financially motivated or speculating in stocks; she owns a substantial inheritance in her own name, and he is himself quite wealthy, with an income that comfortably supports their lifestyle. Their marriage, lasting two years without serious quarrels or cross words, had been harmonious until recently. The Thinking Machine probes carefully, asking about the history of their relationship, any prior conflicts, and other signs that might indicate a motive or pattern of deception.\n\nThroughout this exchange, Mr. van Safford reveals his deep personal investment not only financially but emotionally—an investment now threatened by the appearance of the “green-eyed monster”: jealousy. His insistence that his wife “wouldn't know one stock from another” and denial of prior quarrels emphasizes his bewilderment at the sudden change. The Thinking Machine’s probing questions about Mr. van Safford’s age and the exact duration of his thirties hint at his methodical approach, exploring all possible variables, including psychological and chronological factors.\n\nIn this way, the story blends mystery with acute psychological insight. Mr. van Safford’s predicament embodies the quintessential domestic detective story—a husband wrestling with the suspicion that the woman he loves is concealing truths from him. His own jealousy, restrained yet potent, threatens to consume rationality. The contrasting character of The Thinking Machine introduces a critical external perspective, representing logic and reason against the backdrop of emotional confusion.\n\nThe narrative structure effectively combines the tension of a detective mystery with nuanced exploration of marital trust and the complexities of human behavior. Small but potent inconsistencies—such as contradictory alibis, false claims about social outings, and a vanishing wife—progressively build a tableau of intrigue and doubt. Yet underlying all these puzzles is the intimate psychological battle of a man trying to discern truth in his domestic sphere and to confront the “problem of the green-eyed monster” within himself.\n\nTo this point, the story reveals a masterful balance between the apparent innocence and the obscure motivations of the central characters. Mrs. van Safford’s erratic and secretive behavior, coupled with Mr. van Safford’s spiraling jealousy, set the stage for a deeper investigation—not only into her possible infidelity or misconduct but into the very nature of trust and perception within marriage. The involvement of The Thinking Machine suggests the forthcoming application of rigorous deduction to unravel the mystery, promising that emotional entanglements will be examined under the cold light of reason.\n\nOverall, the story thus far intricately weaves suspense, emotional complexity, and psychological realism, inviting readers to ponder the fragile boundaries between love, suspicion, and truth. Mr. van Safford’s journey from affectionate husband to a man tormented by doubt and nearly driven to violence, and his reaching out to a brilliant detective figure, lays a compelling groundwork for the unfolding unraveling of the green-eyed monster’s riddle."

      "chunk_text": "\"Six months—since last May.\"\nThere was a long pause. Mr. van Safford plainly did not see the trend of the questioning.\n\"How old is your wife?\" demanded the scientist.\n\"Twenty-two, in January.\"\n\"She has never had any mental trouble of any sort?\"\n\"No, no.\"\n\"Have you any brothers or sisters?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Has she?\"\n\"No.\"\nTHE Thinking Machine shot out the questions crustily and Mr. van Safford answered briefly. There was another pause, and the young man arose and paced back and forth with nervous energy. From time to time he glanced inquiringly at the pale, wizened face of the scientist. Several thin lines had appeared in the dome-like brow, and he was apparently oblivious of the other's presence.\n\"It's a most intangible, elusive affair,\" he commented at last, and the wrinkles deepened. \"It is, I may say, a problem without a given quantity. Perfectly extraordinary.\"\nMr. van Safford seemed a little relieved to find some one express his own thoughts so accurately.\n\"You don't believe, of course,\" continued the scientist, \"that there is anything criminal in-\"\n\"Certainly not!\" the young man exploded, violently.\n\"Yet, the moment we pursue this to a logical conclusion,\" pursued the other, \"we are more than likely to uncover something which is, to put it mildly, not pleasant.\"\nMr. van Safford's face was perfectly white; his hands were clenched desperately. Then the loyalty to the woman he loved flooded his heart.\n\"It's nothing of that kind,\" he exclaimed, and yet his own heart misgave him. \"My wife is the dearest, noblest, sweetest woman in the world. And yet—\"\n\"Yet you are jealous of her,\" interrupted The Thinking Machine. \"If you are so sure of her, why annoy me with your troubles?\"\nThe young man read, perhaps, a deeper meaning than The Thinking Machine had intended for he started forward impulsively. The Thinking Machine continued to squint at him impersonally, but did not change his position.\n\"All young men are fools,\" he went on, blandly, \"and I may add that most of the old ones are, too. But now the question is: What purpose can your wife have in acting as she has, and in misrepresenting those acts to you? Of course we must spy upon her to find out, and the answer may be one that will wreck your future happiness. It may be, I say. I don't know. Do you still want the answer?\"\n\"I want to know—I want to know,\" burst out Mr. van Safford, harshly. \"I shall go mad unless I know.\"\nThe Thinking Machine continued to squint at him with almost a gleam of pity in his eyes—almost but not quite. And the habitually irritated voice was in no way softened when he gave some explicit and definite instructions.\n\"Go on about your affairs,\" he commanded. \"Let things go as they are. Don't quarrel with your wife; continue to ask your questions because if you don't she'll suspect that you suspect; report to me any change in her conduct. It's a very singular problem. Certainly I have never had another like it.\"\nThe Thinking Machine accompanied him to the door and closed it behind him.\n\"I have never seen a man in love,\" he mused, \"who wasn't in trouble.\"\nAND with this broad, philosophical conclusion he went to the 'phone. Half an hour later Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, entered the laboratory where the scientist sat in deep thought.\n\"Ah, Mr. Hatch,\" he began, without preliminary, \"did you ever happen to hear of Mr. and Mrs. van Safford?\"\n\"Well, rather,\" responded the reporter with quick interest. \"He's a well known club-man, worth millions, high in society and all that; and she's one of the most beautiful women I ever saw. She was a Miss Potter before marriage.\"\n\"It's wonderful the memories you newspaper men have,\" observed the scientist. \"You know her personally?\"\nHatch shook his head.\n\"You must find some one who knows her well,\" commanded The Thinking Machine, \"a girl friend, for instance—one who might be in her confidence. Learn from her why Mrs. van Safford leaves her house every morning at eight o'clock, then tells her husband she has been with some one that we know she hasn't seen. She has done this every day for four days. Your assiduity in this may prevent a divorce.\"\nHatch pricked up his ears.\n\"Also find out just what sort of an illness Miss Nell Blakesley has—or is—suffering. That's all.\"\nAN hour later Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, called on Miss Gladys Beekman, a young society woman who was an intimate of Mrs. van Safford's before the latter's marriage. Without feeling that he was dallying with the truth Hatch informed her that he called on behalf of Mr. van Safford. She began to smile. He laid the case before her emphatically, seriously and with great detail. The more he explained the more pleasantly she smiled. It made him uncomfortable but he struggled on to the end.\n\"I'm glad she did it,\" exclaimed Miss Beekman. \"But I—I couldn't believe she would.\"\nThen came a sudden gust of laughter which left Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, with the feeling that he was being imposed upon. It continued for a full minute—a hearty, rippling, musical laugh. Hatch grinned sheepishly. Then, without an excuse, Miss Beekman arose and left the room. In the hall there came a fresh burst, and Hatch heard it dying away in the distance.\n\"Well,\" he muttered grimly. \"I'm glad I was able to amuse her.\"\nThen he called upon a Mrs. Francis, a young matron whom he had cause to believe was also favoured with Mrs. van Safford's friendship. He laid the case before her, and she laughed! Then Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, began to get mule-headed about it. He visited eight other women who were known to be on friendly terms with Mrs. van Safford. Six of them intimated that he was an impertinent, prying, inquisitive person, and—the other two laughed! Hatch paused a moment and rubbed his fevered brow.\n\"Here's a corking good joke on somebody,\" he told himself, \"and I'm beginning to think it's me.\"\nWhereupon he took his troubles to The Thinking Machine. That distinguished gentleman listened in pained surprise to the simple recital of what Hatch had not been able to learn, and spidery wrinkles on his forehead assumed the relative importance of the canals on Mars.\n\"It's astonishing!\" he declared, raspily.\n\"Yes, it so struck me,\" agreed the reporter.\nThe Thinking Machine was silent for a long time; the watery blue eyes were turned upward and the slender white fingers pressed tip to tip. Finally he made up his mind as to the next step.\n\"There seems only one thing to do,\" he said. \"And I won't ask you to do that.\"\n\"What is it?\" demanded the reporter.\n\"To watch Mrs. van Safford and see where she goes.\"\n\"I wouldn't have done it before, but I will now.\" Hatch responded promptly. The bull-dog in him was aroused. \"I want to see what the joke is.\"\nIT was ten o'clock next evening when Hatch called to make a report. He seemed a little weary and tremendously disgusted.\n\"I've been right behind her all day,\" he explained, \"from eight o'clock this morning until twenty minutes past nine tonight when she reached home. And if the Lord'll forgive me—\"\n\"What did she do?\" interrupted The Thinking Machine, impatiently.\n\"Well,\" and Hatch grinned as he drew out a notebook, \"she walked eastward from her house to the first corner, turned, walked another block, took a down town car, and went straight to the Public Library. There she read a Henry James book until fifteen minutes of one, and then she went to luncheon in a restaurant. I also had luncheon. Then she went to the North End on a car. After she got there she wandered around aimlessly all afternoon, nearly. At ten minutes of four she gave a quarter to a crippled boy. He bit it to see if it was good, found it was, then bought cigarettes with it. At half past four she left the North End and went into a big department store. If there's anything there she didn't price I can't remember it. She bought a pair of shoe-laces. The store closed at six, so she went to dinner in another restaurant. I also had dinner. We left there at half past seven o'clock and went back to the Public Library. She read until nine o'clock, and then went home. Phew!\" he concluded.",

Yet underlying all these puzzles is the intimate psychological battle of a man trying to discern truth in his domestic sphere and to confront the “problem of the green-eyed monster” within himself.\n\nTo this point, the story reveals a masterful balance between the apparent innocence and the obscure motivations of the central characters. Mrs. van Safford’s erratic and secretive behavior, coupled with Mr. van Safford’s spiraling jealousy, set the stage for a deeper investigation—not only into her possible infidelity or misconduct but into the very nature of trust and perception within marriage. The involvement of The Thinking Machine suggests the forthcoming application of rigorous deduction to unravel the mystery, promising that emotional entanglements will be examined under the cold light of reason.\n\nOverall, the story thus far intricately weaves suspense, emotional complexity, and psychological realism, inviting readers to ponder the fragile boundaries between love, suspicion, and truth. Mr. van Safford’s journey from affectionate husband to a man tormented by doubt and nearly driven to violence, and his reaching out to a brilliant detective figure, lays a compelling groundwork for the unfolding unraveling of the green-eyed monster’s riddle.\n\nCurrent segment (part 3):\n\"Six months—since last May.\"\nThere was a long pause. Mr. van Safford plainly did not see the trend of the questioning.\n\"How old is your wife?\" demanded the scientist.\n\"Twenty-two, in January.\"\n\"She has never had any mental trouble of any sort?\"\n\"No, no.\"\n\"Have you any brothers or sisters?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Has she?\"\n\"No.\"\nTHE Thinking Machine shot out the questions crustily and Mr. van Safford answered briefly. There was another pause, and the young man arose and paced back and forth with nervous energy. From time to time he glanced inquiringly at the pale, wizened face of the scientist. Several thin lines had appeared in the dome-like brow, and he was apparently oblivious of the other's presence.\n\"It's a most intangible, elusive affair,\" he commented at last, and the wrinkles deepened. \"It is, I may say, a problem without a given quantity. Perfectly extraordinary.\"\nMr. van Safford seemed a little relieved to find some one express his own thoughts so accurately.\n\"You don't believe, of course,\" continued the scientist, \"that there is anything criminal in-\"\n\"Certainly not!\" the young man exploded, violently.\n\"Yet, the moment we pursue this to a logical conclusion,\" pursued the other, \"we are more than likely to uncover something which is, to put it mildly, not pleasant.\"\nMr. van Safford's face was perfectly white; his hands were clenched desperately. Then the loyalty to the woman he loved flooded his heart.\n\"It's nothing of that kind,\" he exclaimed, and yet his own heart misgave him. \"My wife is the dearest, noblest, sweetest woman in the world. And yet—\"\n\"Yet you are jealous of her,\" interrupted The Thinking Machine. \"If you are so sure of her, why annoy me with your troubles?\"\nThe young man read, perhaps, a deeper meaning than The Thinking Machine had intended for he started forward impulsively. The Thinking Machine continued to squint at him impersonally, but did not change his position.\n\"All young men are fools,\" he went on, blandly, \"and I may add that most of the old ones are, too. But now the question is: What purpose can your wife have in acting as she has, and in misrepresenting those acts to you? Of course we must spy upon her to find out, and the answer may be one that will wreck your future happiness. It may be, I say. I don't know. Do you still want the answer?\"\n\"I want to know—I want to know,\" burst out Mr. van Safford, harshly. \"I shall go mad unless I know.\"\nThe Thinking Machine continued to squint at him with almost a gleam of pity in his eyes—almost but not quite. And the habitually irritated voice was in no way softened when he gave some explicit and definite instructions.\n\"Go on about your affairs,\" he commanded. \"Let things go as they are. Don't quarrel with your wife; continue to ask your questions because if you don't she'll suspect that you suspect; report to me any change in her conduct. It's a very singular problem. Certainly I have never had another like it.\"\nThe Thinking Machine accompanied him to the door and closed it behind him.\n\"I have never seen a man in love,\" he mused, \"who wasn't in trouble.\"\nAND with this broad, philosophical conclusion he went to the 'phone. Half an hour later Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, entered the laboratory where the scientist sat in deep thought.\n\"Ah, Mr. Hatch,\" he began, without preliminary, \"did you ever happen to hear of Mr. and Mrs. van Safford?\"\n\"Well, rather,\" responded the reporter with quick interest. \"He's a well known club-man, worth millions, high in society and all that; and she's one of the most beautiful women I ever saw. She was a Miss Potter before marriage.\"\n\"It's wonderful the memories you newspaper men have,\" observed the scientist. \"You know her personally?\"\nHatch shook his head.\n\"You must find some one who knows her well,\" commanded The Thinking Machine, \"a girl friend, for instance—one who might be in her confidence. Learn from her why Mrs. van Safford leaves her house every morning at eight o'clock, then tells her husband she has been with some one that we know she hasn't seen. She has done this every day for four days. Your assiduity in this may prevent a divorce.\"\nHatch pricked up his ears.\n\"Also find out just what sort of an illness Miss Nell Blakesley has—or is—suffering. That's all.\"\nAN hour later Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, called on Miss Gladys Beekman, a young society woman who was an intimate of Mrs. van Safford's before the latter's marriage. Without feeling that he was dallying with the truth Hatch informed her that he called on behalf of Mr. van Safford. She began to smile. He laid the case before her emphatically, seriously and with great detail. The more he explained the more pleasantly she smiled. It made him uncomfortable but he struggled on to the end.\n\"I'm glad she did it,\" exclaimed Miss Beekman. \"But I—I couldn't believe she would.\"\nThen came a sudden gust of laughter which left Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, with the feeling that he was being imposed upon. It continued for a full minute—a hearty, rippling, musical laugh. Hatch grinned sheepishly. Then, without an excuse, Miss Beekman arose and left the room. In the hall there came a fresh burst, and Hatch heard it dying away in the distance.\n\"Well,\" he muttered grimly. \"I'm glad I was able to amuse her.\"\nThen he called upon a Mrs. Francis, a young matron whom he had cause to believe was also favoured with Mrs. van Safford's friendship. He laid the case before her, and she laughed! Then Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, began to get mule-headed about it. He visited eight other women who were known to be on friendly terms with Mrs. van Safford. Six of them intimated that he was an impertinent, prying, inquisitive person, and—the other two laughed! Hatch paused a moment and rubbed his fevered brow.\n\"Here's a corking good joke on somebody,\" he told himself, \"and I'm beginning to think it's me.\"\nWhereupon he took his troubles to The Thinking Machine. That distinguished gentleman listened in pained surprise to the simple recital of what Hatch had not been able to learn, and spidery wrinkles on his forehead assumed the relative importance of the canals on Mars.\n\"It's astonishing!\" he declared, raspily.\n\"Yes, it so struck me,\" agreed the reporter.\nThe Thinking Machine was silent for a long time; the watery blue eyes were turned upward and the slender white fingers pressed tip to tip. Finally he made up his mind as to the next step.\n\"There seems only one thing to do,\" he said. \"And I won't ask you to do that.\"\n\"What is it?\" demanded the reporter.\n\"To watch Mrs. van Safford and see where she goes.\"\n\"I wouldn't have done it before, but I will now.\" Hatch responded promptly. The bull-dog in him was aroused. \"I want to see what the joke is.\"\nIT was ten o'clock next evening when Hatch called to make a report. He seemed a little weary and tremendously disgusted.\n\"I've been right behind her all day,\" he explained, \"from eight o'clock this morning until twenty minutes past nine tonight when she reached home. And if the Lord'll forgive me—\"\n\"What did she do?\" interrupted The Thinking Machine, impatiently.\n\"Well,\" and Hatch grinned as he drew out a notebook, \"she walked eastward from her house to the first corner, turned, walked another block, took a down town car, and went straight to the Public Library. There she read a Henry James book until fifteen minutes of one, and then she went to luncheon in a restaurant. I also had luncheon. Then she went to the North End on a car. After she got there she wandered around aimlessly all afternoon, nearly. At ten minutes of four she gave a quarter to a crippled boy. He bit it to see if it was good, found it was, then bought cigarettes with it. At half past four she left the North End and went into a big department store. If there's anything there she didn't price I can't remember it. She bought a pair of shoe-laces. The store closed at six, so she went to dinner in another restaurant. I also had dinner. We left there at half past seven o'clock and went back to the Public Library. She read until nine o'clock, and then went home. Phew!\" he concluded.\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "“The Problem of the Green-Eyed Monster” is a psychological detective story that delves deep into themes of jealousy, trust, and the intricate dynamics of marital relationships through the eyes of Mr. Lingard van Safford, a wealthy and respectable man. The narrative slowly builds an atmosphere of suspicion and emotional turmoil as Mr. van Safford grapples with his wife’s increasingly secretive behavior, and his desperate search for truth.\n\nThe story begins in a seemingly stable and affluent household, marked by the abrupt change in Mrs. van Safford’s routine when she leaves the house unexpectedly and without informing her husband. This solitary departure—an unusual occurrence—ignites Mr. van Safford’s growing unease. His wife’s contradictory explanations, coupled with an encounter with Mrs. Blacklock who claims not to have seen Mrs. van Safford for weeks, propel him into a state of restless suspicion. Her behavior, oscillating between affectionate warmth and guarded evasiveness, destabilizes the couple’s harmony and propels Mr. van Safford into an anxious quest for answers.\n\nTensions reach a boiling point following a tense morning exchange that leaves Mrs. van Safford visibly distressed. Mr. van Safford pursues a lead by contacting Nell Blakesley, an acquaintance his wife claimed had been with her, only to discover that Miss Blakesley was ill and had not owned or used a touring car recently—directly contradicting Mrs. van Safford’s story. This shatters Mr. van Safford’s trust and plunges him into a painful uncertainty, as he feels estranged not just from his wife, but from the very world they inhabit together.\n\nFurther complicating matters, when Mr. van Safford follows his wife one morning, she mysteriously disappears after leaving the house, either slipping away into a cab or entering nearby residences unknown to him. Despite these concerns, life outwardly continues with a fragile normalcy as Mrs. van Safford returns home exhibiting signs of emotional strain herself. The servant confirms Mr. van Safford’s late return but notes that his wife left early, reinforcing the image of a fracturing household united by suspicion and secrecy.\n\nIn his desperation, Mr. van Safford turns to the renowned Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, colloquially called The Thinking Machine. Van Dusen’s brisk, almost brusque manner sharply contrasts with Mr. van Safford’s emotional vulnerability and hesitancy. Through a rapid-fire series of questions, The Thinking Machine probes personal details—Mrs. van Safford’s age, mental stability, family background, and the history of the couple’s relationship—seeking to map the psychological landscape underlying the mystery.\n\nThe dialogue reveals that Mrs. van Safford is young, healthy, and without history of mental illness; both husband and wife are wealthy, well-matched in social standing, and have enjoyed a peaceful marriage for two years prior to recent disturbances. Yet, despite assurances that no financial motive or prior conflicts exist, The Thinking Machine identifies a critical point of fracture: jealousy. Mr. van Safford is tormented by the “green-eyed monster,” a jealousy rooted not in tangible proof but in his wife’s inconsistent accounts and evasive behaviors.\n\nVan Dusen warns that pursuing the truth may reveal unpleasant realities—though not necessarily criminal ones—and advises Mr. van Safford to maintain calm, avoid open confrontation, and report any changes. This approach emphasizes subtle observation over impulsive actions, reflecting The Thinking Machine’s reliance on logic and method over emotional hysteria. As Mr. van Safford departs, the professor muses philosophically that love often leads men into trouble—an acknowledgment of the emotional contradictions at play.\n\nTaking up the investigation, The Thinking Machine enlists Hutchinson Hatch, a determined newspaper reporter, to gather information on Mrs. van Safford’s social circle and habits. Hatch quickly learns that Mrs. van Safford is a well-known beauty of high society, formerly Miss Potter, admired but enigmatic. His inquiries among her friends yield no insights; instead, they provoke laughter or dismissive responses, suggesting the existence of a social façade or protected secrets that outsiders cannot breach. This reception frustrates Hatch and deepens the mystery, as it implies that whatever Mrs. van Safford’s motives or actions may be, they are concealed under layers of societal amusement or indifference.\n\nRecognizing the limitations of hearsay, The Thinking Machine directs Hatch to directly observe Mrs. van Safford’s actions herself. Hatch undertakes a painstaking daylong surveillance beginning at eight in the morning and ending well past nine at night. His detailed report dramatically undercuts any supposition of secret trysts or villainous behavior. Mrs. van Safford’s day is mundane and remarkably harmless. She walks calmly and purposefully through the city, visiting the Public Library to read Henry James, dining alone at restaurants, venturing to the economically disadvantaged North End where she gives a quarter to a crippled boy (who surprises Hatch by using the coin to buy cigarettes), and shopping for trivial items such as shoelaces in a department store. She then returns to the library before finally going home.\n\nThis revelation forces a recalibration of the entire mystery. Far from being involved in clandestine affairs or deceitful schemes, Mrs. van Safford’s daily conduct appears benign and even quietly charitable. The reporter’s grueling surveillance paints a portrait of a woman engaging in simple, unsuspicious activities, incongruous with the suspicion and jealousy that have consumed Mr. van Safford. The narrative thus exposes a profound conflict between appearance and perception, between emotional conjecture and empirical observation.\n\nThroughout the story, the interplay between Mr. van Safford’s emotional vulnerability and The Thinking Machine’s logical rigor highlights the tension between human passion and intellectual investigation. Mr. van Safford’s jealous suspicions resemble a psychological battle raging within, while The Thinking Machine’s cool, unflinching scrutiny offers a counterbalance grounded in evidence and reason.\n\nMoreover, Mrs. van Safford emerges not as a villain or adulteress but as a complex figure caught between societal expectations, personal freedoms, and perhaps undisclosed pains expressed in secretive departures or silences. The laughter and dismissiveness from her social acquaintances could indicate protective complicity or subtle hints of her true circumstances that remain just out of reach.\n\nIn sum, “The Problem of the Green-Eyed Monster” is a nuanced detective story that transcends mere mystery to probe the fragility of trust in intimate relationships and the perils of jealousy. The mounting contradictions—the woman’s secrecy, the husband’s spiraling doubts, the outsider’s failure to find wrongdoing, and the sharp intellect of The Thinking Machine striving to disentangle emotional chaos from factual reality—compose a compelling psychological puzzle. As the investigation deepens, readers are drawn to consider not only what Mrs. van Safford’s true motivations might be but also how human minds interpret and sometimes misconstrue the ambiguities of love and suspicion in the domestic sphere.\n\nThe story invites reflection on how the “green-eyed monster” can distort perception and threaten happiness, and how patient, impartial inquiry offers the hope of clarity amid emotional turmoil. With the detailed surveillance report in hand, the stage is set for the final revelation—a resolution that promises to reconcile or further complicate the delicate balance between truth and trust."

      "chunk_text": "The Thinking Machine had listened with growing and obvious disappointment on his face. He seemed so cast down by the recital that Hatch tried to cheer him.\n\"I couldn't help it you know,\" he said by way of apology. \"That's what she did.\"\n\"She didn't speak to anyone?\"\n\"Not a soul but clerks, waiters and library attendants.\"\n\"She didn't give a note to anyone or receive a note?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Did she seem to have any purpose at all in anything she did?\"\n\"No. The impression she gave me was that she was killing time.\"\nThe Thinking Machine was silent for several minutes. \"I think perhaps—\" he began.\nBUT what he thought Hatch didn't learn for he was sent away with additional instructions. Next morning found him watching the front of the van Safford house again. Mrs. van Safford came out at seven minutes past eight o'clock, and walked rapidly eastward. She turned the first corner and went on, still rapidly, to the corner of an alley. There she paused, cast a quick look behind her, and went in. Hatch was some distance back and ran forward just in time to see her skirts trailing into a door.\n\"Ah, here's something anyhow,\" he told himself, with grim satisfaction.\nHe walked along the alley to the door. It was like the other doors along in that it led into the back hall of a house, and was intended for the use of tradesmen. When he examined the door he scratched his chin thoughtfully; then came utter bewilderment, an amazing sense of hopeless insanity. For there, staring at him from a door-plate, was the name: \"van Safford.\" She had merely come out the front door and gone into the back!\nHatch started to rap and ask some questions, then changed his mind and walked around to the front again, and up the steps.\n\"Is Mrs. van Safford in?\" he inquired of Baxter, who opened the door.\n\"No, sir,\" was the reply. \"She went out a few minutes ago.\"\nHatch stared at him coldly a minute, then walked away.\n\"Now this is a particularly savoury kettle of fish,\" he soliloquized. \"She has either gone back into the house without his knowledge, or else he has been bribed, and then—\"\nAND then, he took the story to The Thinking Machine. That imperturbable man of science listened to the end, then arose and said \"Oh!\" three times. Which was interesting to Hatch in that it showed the end was in sight, but it was not illuminating. He was still floundering.\nThe Thinking Machine started into an adjoining room, then turned back.\n\"By the way, Mr. Hatch,\" he asked, \"did you happen to find out what was the matter with Miss Blakesley?\"\n\"By George, I forgot it,\" returned the reporter, ruefully.\n\"Never mind, I'll find out.\"\nAT eleven o'clock Hutchinson Hatch and The Thinking Machine called at the van Safford home. Mr. van Safford in person received them; there was a gleam of hope in his face at sight of the diminutive scientist. Hatch was introduced, then:\n\"You don't know of any other van Safford family in this block?\" began the scientist.\n\"There's not another family in the city,\" was the reply. \"Why?\"\n\"Is your wife in now?\"\n\"No. She went out this morning, as usual.\"\n\"Now, Mr. van Safford, I'll tell you how you may bring this matter to an end, and understand it all at once. Go upstairs to your wife's apartments—they are probably locked—and call her. She won't answer but she'll hear you. Then tell her you understand it all, and that you're sorry. She'll hear that, as that alone is what she has been waiting to hear for some time. When she comes out bring her down stairs. Believe me I should be delighted to meet so clever a woman.\"\nMr. van Safford was looking at him as if he doubted his sanity.\n\"Really,\" he said coldly, \"what sort of child's play is this?\"\n\"It's the only way you'll ever coax her out of that room,\" snapped The Thinking Machine belligerently, \"and you'd better do it gracefully.\"\n\"Are you serious?\" demanded the other.\n\"Perfectly serious,\" was the crabbed rejoinder. \"She has taught you a lesson that you'll remember for some time. She has been merely going out the front door every day, and coming in the back, with the full knowledge of the cook and her maid.\"\nMr. van Safford listened in amazement.\n\"Why did she do it?\" he asked.\n\"Why?\" retorted The Thinking Machine. \"That's for you to answer. A little less of your time at the club of evenings, and a little less of selfish amusement, so that you can pay attention to a beautiful woman who has, previous to her marriage at least, been accustomed to constant attention, would solve this little problem. You've spent every evening at your club for months, and she was here alone probably a great part of that time. In your own selfishness you had never a thought of her, so she gave you a reason to think of her.\"\nSuddenly Mr. van Safford turned and ran out of the room. They heard him as he took the stairs, two at a time.\n\"By George!\" remarked Hatch. \"That's a silly ending to a cracking good mystery, isn't it?\"\nTEN minutes later Mr. and Mrs. van Safford entered the room. Her pretty face was suffused with colour: he was frankly, outrageously happy. There were mutual introductions.\n\"It was perfectly dreadful of Mr. van Safford to call you gentlemen into this affair,\" Mrs. van Safford apologized, charmingly. \"Really I feel very much ashamed of myself for—\"\n\"It's of no consequence, madam,\" The Thinking Machine assured her. \"It's the first opportunity I have ever had of studying a woman's mind. It was not at all logical, but it was very—very instructive. I may add that it was effective, too.\"\nHe bowed low, and turning picked up his hat.\n\"But your fee?\" suggested Mr. van Safford.\nThe Thinking Machine squinted at him sourly. \"Oh, yes, my fee,\" he mused. \"It will be just five thousand dollars.\"\n\"Five thousand dollars?\" exclaimed Mr. van Safford.\n\"Five thousand dollars,\" repeated the scientist.\n\"Why, man, it's perfectly absurd to talk—\"\nMrs. van Safford laid one white hand on her husband's arm. He glanced at her and she smiled radiantly.\n\"Don't you think I'm worth it, Van?\" she asked, archly.\nHe wrote the cheque. The Thinking Machine scribbled his name across the back in a crabbed little hand, and passed it on to Hatch.\n\"Please hand that to some charitable organization,\" he directed. \"It was an excellent lesson, Mrs. van Safford. Good day.\"",

Go upstairs to your wife's apartments—they are probably locked—and call her. She won't answer but she'll hear you. Then tell her you understand it all, and that you're sorry. She'll hear that, as that alone is what she has been waiting to hear for some time. When she comes out bring her down stairs. Believe me I should be delighted to meet so clever a woman.\"\nMr. van Safford was looking at him as if he doubted his sanity.\n\"Really,\" he said coldly, \"what sort of child's play is this?\"\n\"It's the only way you'll ever coax her out of that room,\" snapped The Thinking Machine belligerently, \"and you'd better do it gracefully.\"\n\"Are you serious?\" demanded the other.\n\"Perfectly serious,\" was the crabbed rejoinder. \"She has taught you a lesson that you'll remember for some time. She has been merely going out the front door every day, and coming in the back, with the full knowledge of the cook and her maid.\"\nMr. van Safford listened in amazement.\n\"Why did she do it?\" he asked.\n\"Why?\" retorted The Thinking Machine. \"That's for you to answer. A little less of your time at the club of evenings, and a little less of selfish amusement, so that you can pay attention to a beautiful woman who has, previous to her marriage at least, been accustomed to constant attention, would solve this little problem. You've spent every evening at your club for months, and she was here alone probably a great part of that time. In your own selfishness you had never a thought of her, so she gave you a reason to think of her.\"\nSuddenly Mr. van Safford turned and ran out of the room. They heard him as he took the stairs, two at a time.\n\"By George!\" remarked Hatch. \"That's a silly ending to a cracking good mystery, isn't it?\"\nTEN minutes later Mr. and Mrs. van Safford entered the room. Her pretty face was suffused with colour: he was frankly, outrageously happy. There were mutual introductions.\n\"It was perfectly dreadful of Mr. van Safford to call you gentlemen into this affair,\" Mrs. van Safford apologized, charmingly. \"Really I feel very much ashamed of myself for—\"\n\"It's of no consequence, madam,\" The Thinking Machine assured her. \"It's the first opportunity I have ever had of studying a woman's mind. It was not at all logical, but it was very—very instructive. I may add that it was effective, too.\"\nHe bowed low, and turning picked up his hat.\n\"But your fee?\" suggested Mr. van Safford.\nThe Thinking Machine squinted at him sourly. \"Oh, yes, my fee,\" he mused. \"It will be just five thousand dollars.\"\n\"Five thousand dollars?\" exclaimed Mr. van Safford.\n\"Five thousand dollars,\" repeated the scientist.\n\"Why, man, it's perfectly absurd to talk—\"\nMrs. van Safford laid one white hand on her husband's arm. He glanced at her and she smiled radiantly.\n\"Don't you think I'm worth it, Van?\" she asked, archly.\nHe wrote the cheque. The Thinking Machine scribbled his name across the back in a crabbed little hand, and passed it on to Hatch.\n\"Please hand that to some charitable organization,\" he directed. \"It was an excellent lesson, Mrs. van Safford. Good day.\"\n\nProvide a summary (between 600 and 900 words long) that combines the new information from this segment with the previous summary.

      "summary": "“The Problem of the Green-Eyed Monster” is a psychological detective story that probes the corrosive power of jealousy and the fragile nature of trust in intimate relationships through the experiences of Mr. Lingard van Safford, a wealthy man tormented by suspicions about his enigmatic wife. The story unfolds as a nuanced exploration of emotional turmoil, social facades, and the tension between perception and reality, culminating in a resolution orchestrated by the analytical genius of Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen—The Thinking Machine.\n\nThe narrative opens in the comfortable van Safford household where Mr. van Safford’s growing anxiety is triggered by his wife’s unusual, secretive behavior. Mrs. van Safford’s unexplained absences and contradictory explanations fuel a deep suspicion in her husband’s mind. His fears intensify following a key encounter with Mrs. Blacklock, who claims to have not seen Mrs. van Safford for weeks, and when a visit to Nell Blakesley—the woman Mrs. van Safford claimed to have been with—reveals her incapacitation and inability to have accompanied Mrs. van Safford, the husband’s doubts deepen. These inconsistencies cast a shadow over their previously peaceful two-year marriage and leave Mr. van Safford facing a crisis of faith not only in his wife but in his entire shared life.\n\nDesperate for clarity, he enlists the help of The Thinking Machine, known for his incisive logic and unemotional approach to human problems. The professor quickly gathers personal details, confirming Mrs. van Safford’s young age, good health, and absence of mental instability, eliminating common grounds for concern. Yet, The Thinking Machine astutely recognizes that jealousy—the titular “green-eyed monster”—has taken root in Mr. van Safford’s psyche, fueled not by proof but by emotional fractures created by secrecy and evasiveness. Advising patience and calm observation rather than confrontational tactics, The Thinking Machine seeks to unravel the truth through reason rather than rashness.\n\nTo supplement his investigation, The Thinking Machine enlists Hutchinson Hatch, a dogged newspaper reporter, to conduct discreet surveillance on Mrs. van Safford’s daily activities. Hatch’s observations deliver a surprising and starkly contradictory picture to Mr. van Safford’s fears: Mrs. van Safford’s day is marked by unremarkable, solitary, and innocent routines. She visits the Public Library to read, dines alone, ventures into poorer quarters where she performs small acts of charity, and shops for mundane necessities. Her interactions are limited to service personnel, and there is no indication of secret meetings or illicit liaisons. This observation highlights a profound disconnect between Mr. van Safford’s jealous suspicions and the actual harmlessness of his wife’s conduct.\n\nDespite this, Mrs. van Safford’s mysterious behavior continues to baffle. One morning, Hatch observes her leave the house through the front door, only to unexpectedly slip into the back door of the same residence through a seemingly inconspicuous alleyway entrance marked with the family name “van Safford.” The revelation that Mrs. van Safford has been physically inside the home during these secretive entries—with the complicity of household staff—exacerbates the confusion, suggesting that her evasive behavior is less about clandestine escapes and more a deliberate act of psychological signaling.\n\nBringing this new clue to The Thinking Machine, Hatch awaits the professor’s interpretation, who then returns with a calm but pointed strategy. The Thinking Machine advises Mr. van Safford to directly confront his wife by calling to her from upstairs, in the belief that Mrs. van Safford has been waiting not for accusations or anger but for an expression of understanding and apology. This advice underscores the emotional crux of the mystery: Mrs. van Safford’s behavior is motivated by a desire to be noticed and valued, thwarted by her husband’s neglect and preoccupation with club life and personal amusements.\n\nMr. van Safford’s initial incredulity at such a seemingly childish tactic gives way to realization as The Thinking Machine explains that the entire mystery is grounded in marital neglect. Mrs. van Safford’s “secret” excursions were symbolic acts aimed at provoking his attention—the daily routine of leaving by the front door and returning by the back, fully in view yet deliberately obscure, orchestrated with full household complicity. It was a subtle but effective rebuke of Mr. van Safford’s failure to engage meaningfully with his wife, a call for reconciliation rather than any genuine deception.\n\nThe story reaches its resolution when Mr. and Mrs. van Safford enter together, revealing a restored harmony and mutual affection. Mrs. van Safford warmly apologizes for the “dreadful” situation, while The Thinking Machine praises her psychological ingenuity despite the absence of logic in her methods. The story closes on a note that blends humor and appreciation; Mr. van Safford reluctantly pays the detective’s fee of five thousand dollars—a hefty sum justified by Mrs. van Safford’s playful prompt that she was worth it. The Thinking Machine, maintaining his characteristic detachment, directs that the fee be donated to charity, framing the investigation not as a mere business transaction but as a profound study in human nature and relationships.\n\nUltimately, “The Problem of the Green-Eyed Monster” transcends its detective-story genre to probe deeper themes of love, neglect, and the dangerous distortions of jealousy. It reveals how unspoken emotions and miscommunications can create elaborate but unnecessary psychological dramas, and how a measured, logical approach can illuminate human complexity and restore balance. Through the interplay of Mr. van Safford’s emotional susceptibility, Mrs. van Safford’s subtle defiance, and The Thinking Machine’s analytical rigor, the story lays bare the tensions between appearance and reality in marriage, the yearning for attention and validation, and the necessity of empathy as the antidote to suspicion.\n\nThis finely wrought narrative invites readers to consider how the “green-eyed monster” of jealousy can cloud judgment and threaten happiness, while demonstrating that clarity and healing often require not evidence of wrongdoing but a willingness to communicate and understand. It is a compelling psychological puzzle that concludes with a resonant lesson on the power of human connection and the folly of letting fears fester unchecked."
