      "chunk_text": "WAS it a specter?\nFor days I could not answer this question. I am no believer in spiritual\nmanifestations, yet--But let me tell my story.\nI was lodging with my wife on the first floor of a house in\nTwenty-seventh street. I had taken the apartments for three months,\nand we had already lived in them two and found them sufficiently\ncomfortable. The back room we used as a bedroom, and while it\ncommunicated with the hall, we invariably made use of the front\nparlor-door to go in and out of. Two great leaves of old mahogany\nconnected the two rooms, and as we received but few friends, these doors\nusually stood half open.\nOne morning, my wife being ill, I left her lying in bed and stepped into\nthe parlor preparatory to going out for breakfast. It was late--nine\no'clock, probably--and I was hastening to leave, when I heard a sound\nbehind me--or did I merely feel a presence?--and, turning, saw a strange\nand totally unknown woman coming toward me from my wife's room.\nAs I had just left that room, and as there was no way of getting into it\nexcept through a door we always kept locked, I was so overpowered by my\nastonishment that I never thought of speaking or moving until she had\npassed me. Then I found voice, and calling out \"Madam!\" endeavored to\nstop her.\nBut the madam, if madam she was, passed on as quietly, as mechanically\neven, as if I had not raised my voice, and, before I could grasp the\nfact that she was melting from before me, flitted through the hall to\nthe front door and so out, leaving behind on the palm of my hand the\n\"feel\" of her wool dress, which I had just managed to touch.\nNot understanding her or myself or the strange thrill awakened by\nthis contact, I tore open the front door and looked out, expecting, of\ncourse, to see her on the steps or on the sidewalk in front. But there\nwas no one of her appearance visible, and I came back questioning\nwhether I was the victim of a hallucination or just an everyday fool.\nTo satisfy myself on this important question I looked about for the\nhall-boy, with the intention of asking him if he had seen any such\nperson go out, but that young and inconsequent scamp was missing from\nhis post as usual, and there was no one within sight to appeal to.\nThere was nothing to do but to re-enter my rooms, where my attention\nwas immediately arrested by the sight of my wife sitting up in bed and\nsurveying me with a look of unmistakable astonishment.\n\"Who was that woman?\" she asked. \"And how came she in here?\"\nSo she had seen her too.\n\"What woman, Lydia? I have not let in any woman. Did you think there was\na woman in this room?\"\n\"Not in that room,\" she answered hoarsely, \"but in this one. I saw her\njust now passing through the folding doors. Wilbur, I am frightened. See\nhow my hands shake. Do you think I am sick enough to imagine things?\"\nI knew she was not, but I did not say so. I thought it would be better\nfor her to think herself under some such delusion.\n\"You were dozing,\" said I. \"If you had seen a woman here, you could tell\nme how she looked.\"\n\"And I can,\" my wife broke in excitedly. \"She was like the ghosts we\nread of, only that her dress and the veil or drapery she wore were all\ngray. Didn't you see her? You must have seen her. She went right by\nyou--a gray woman, all gray; a lady, Wilbur, and slightly lame. Could I\nhave dreamed all that?\"\n\"You must have!\" I cried, shaking the one door communicating with the\nhall, so she might see it was locked, and even showing her the key of\nit, lying in its accustomed place behind the bureau cushion. Yet I\nwas in no satisfied condition myself, for she had described with the\ngreatest accuracy the very person I had myself seen. Had we been alike\nthe victims of a spiritual manifestation?\nThis was Tuesday. On Friday my question seemed to receive an answer. I\nhad been down town, as usual, and on returning found a crowd assembled\nin front of my lodging-house. A woman had been run over and was being\ncarried into our rooms. In the glimpse I caught of her I saw that she\nwas middle-aged and was wrapped in a long black cloak. Later, this cloak\nfell off, as her hat had done long before, and I perceived that her\ndress was black and decent.\nShe was laid on our bed and every attention paid her. But she had been\ngrievously injured about the head and gradually but surely sank before\nour eyes. Suddenly she roused and gave a look about her. It was a\nremarkable one--a look of recognition and almost of delight. Then she\nraised one hand and, pointing with a significant gesture into the empty\nspace before her, sank back and died.\nIt was a sudden ending, and, anxious to see its effect upon my wife, who\nwas standing on the other side of the bed, I glanced her way with some\nmisgiving. She showed more feeling than I had anticipated. Indeed her\ncountenance was a study, and when, under, the influence of my scrutiny\nshe glanced my way, I saw that something of deeper import than this\nunexpected death in our rooms lay at the bottom of her uneasy look.\nWhat that was, I was soon to know, for catching up from amid the folds\nof the woman's gray-lined cloak a long gray veil which had fallen at\nthe bedside, she disposed it softly about the woman's face, darting me a\nlook full of significance.\n\"You remember the vision I had the morning when I was sick?\" she\nwhispered softly in my ear.\nI nodded, secretly thrilled to my very heart's core.\n\"Well, it was a vision of this woman. If she were living and on her\nfeet and wrapped, as I have shown you, in this veil, you would behold\na living picture of the person I saw passing out of this room that\nmorning.\"\n\"I shall not dispute you,\" I answered. Alas, I had myself perceived the\nlikeness the minute the veil had fallen about the pinched but handsome\nfeatures!\n\"A forewarning,\" whispered my wife, \"a forewarning of what has this day\nhappened under our roof. It was a wraith we saw. Wilbur, I shall not\nspend another night in these rooms.\"\nAnd we did not. I was as anxious to leave as she was. Yet I am not\na superstitious man. As proof of it, after the first effect of these\nevents had left me, I began to question my first impressions and feel\ntolerably ashamed of my past credulity. Though the phenomenon we\nhad observed could not to all appearance be explained by any natural\nhypothesis; though I had seen, and my wife had seen, a strange woman\nsuddenly become visible in a room which a moment before had held no one\nbut ourselves, and into which no live woman could have entered without\nour knowledge, something--was it my natural good sense?--recoiled before\na supernatural explanation of this, and I found myself forced to believe\nthat our first visitor had been as real as the last; in other words, the\nsame woman.\nBut could I prove it? Could the seemingly impossible be made possible\nand the unexplainable receive a solution satisfying to a rational mind?\nI determined to make an effort to accomplish this, if only to relieve\nthe mind of my wife, who had not recovered her equanimity as readily as\nmyself.\nStarting with the assumption above mentioned--that the woman who\nhad died in our presence was the same who had previously found an\nunexplainable entrance into these same rooms--I first inquired if the\nblack cloak lined with gray did not offer a solution to some of my\nprevious difficulties. It was a long cloak, enveloping her completely.\nWhen worn with the black side out, she would present an inconspicuous\nappearance, but with the gray side out and the effect of this heightened\nby a long gray veil flung over her hat, she would look like the gray\nlady I had first seen. Now, a cloak can be turned in an instant, and if\nshe had chosen to do this in flitting through my door I would naturally\nfind only a sedate, black-clothed woman passing up the street, when,\nrousing from the apathy into which her appearance had thrown me, I\nrushed to the front door and looked out. Had I seen such a woman? I\nseemed to remember that I had. Thus much, then, was satisfactory, but to\naccount for her entrance into our rooms was not so easy. Had she slipped\nby me in coming in as she had on going out? The parlor door was open,\nfor I had been out to get the paper. Could she have glided in by me\nunperceived and thus have found her way into the bedroom from which I\nafterward saw her issue? No, for I had stood facing the front hall door\nall the time. Through the bedroom door then? But that was, as I have\nsaid, locked. Here was a mystery, then; but it was one worth solving.\nMy first step was to recall all that I had heard of the actual woman who\nhad been buried from our rooms. Her name, as ascertained in the cheap\nboarding-house to which she was traced, was Helmuth, and she was, so far",

      "summary": "In the opening segment of the detective story *The Gray Madam*, the narrator recounts a strange and unsettling experience that he and his wife, Lydia, endure while lodging in an apartment on Twenty-seventh Street. The narrator, an otherwise rational man who dismisses spiritual phenomena, is confronted with an event that challenges his skepticism and draws him into a mysterious and eerie sequence of occurrences.\n\nThe story begins with the narrator and his wife living comfortably in their rented apartments, which they have occupied for about two months of a three-month lease. Their living quarters consist of a back room used as a bedroom and a front parlor, connected by two large mahogany folding doors that usually stand half open. The narrator notes that they rarely entertain visitors, so these doors remain mostly open for convenience.\n\nOne morning, as the narrator prepares to leave for breakfast, he steps into the parlor, leaving his wife lying ill in bed in the adjoining back room. As he is about to leave—around nine o’clock—he becomes aware of a presence behind him. Turning around, he is astonished to see a strange woman emerging from his wife’s room. This is bewildering because the bedroom door, through which the woman must have passed, is always kept locked, and the narrator had just exited from that very room himself moments earlier.\n\nFrozen in astonishment, the narrator does not immediately speak or move. The mysterious woman passes before him quietly and mechanically, as if oblivious to his presence and his call of “Madam!” He manages to touch her hand and feels the texture of her wool dress. Intrigued and confused, he opens the front door quickly to see if she is still outside but finds no one on the steps or the sidewalk. He is left questioning both his sanity and the reality of the encounter, wondering whether it might be a hallucination or some other rational explanation.\n\nSeeking confirmation, he looks for the hall-boy to inquire if anyone has seen the woman, but the boy is absent, leaving the narrator without a witness. Returning to his rooms, he finds his wife sitting up in bed, visibly shaken and astonished. Lydia confirms that she too saw the woman, passing through the folding doors. She describes the figure vividly—a “gray woman, all gray,” dressed in a veil or drapery, resembling a ghost from their readings, and notes that the woman appeared slightly lame. Lydia is frightened and questions whether she is ill enough to imagine such things.\n\nThe narrator reassures her that she must have been dreaming, emphasizing that the bedroom door was locked and that no woman could have entered without their knowledge. Still, the striking similarity between the woman Lydia described and the apparition the narrator himself witnessed defies easy explanation. The couple is left pondering whether they had both seen a “wraith,” possibly a spiritual manifestation.\n\nThree days later, on Friday, an event occurs that appears to confirm the mysterious encounter. The narrator returns from downtown to find a crowd gathered outside the lodging house, watching as a middle-aged woman, severely injured in an accident, is carried into their rooms. The woman is wrapped in a long black cloak, which later falls away to reveal a decent black dress. She is placed on their bed and tended to, but she suffers grievous head injuries and eventually succumbs.\n\nBefore her death, the woman gives a remarkable look of recognition and almost delight as she glances about. She points toward an empty space before her and then dies suddenly. Observing this, the narrator notices that his wife’s expression reveals deeper concern than anticipated. Lydia picks up a long gray veil that had fallen from the woman’s cloak and arranges it about her face, looking meaningfully at her husband.\n\nLydia whispers that the veil and the woman correspond exactly to the mysterious “gray lady” she had seen days before when ill. The vision was a forewarning of the tragic incident that took place in their rooms. This realization terrifies Lydia, who declares that she will not spend another night there, and the couple promptly leaves the apartment.\n\nDespite the emotional impact, the narrator struggles with superstition and rationality. He admits that he is not a superstitious man and tries to find a logical explanation for the unexplainable event. He considers the possibility that the first woman they saw was not a ghost but the same real woman who later died in their rooms. The key to this understanding lies in the woman’s cloak, which is black on one side and lined with gray on the other.\n\nThe narrator reasons that the cloak, when worn black-side out with a black veil, would appear as a discreetly dressed woman, but if reversed and combined with the long gray veil, it would produce the spectral gray appearance he and his wife witnessed. The cloak could be turned quickly, allowing the woman to present different appearances and thus explain why the narrator saw only a black-cloaked figure outside after the first sighting.\n\nHowever, the mystery of how the woman could have entered their locked bedroom remains unresolved. The front door to the hall was open, and the parlor door was also open, but there would have been no way for the woman to slip by unnoticed, given the narrator’s position facing the door the entire time. This locked door into the bedroom is a central enigma.\n\nDetermined to solve the puzzle and relieve his wife’s anxiety, the narrator decides to investigate further. He begins by trying to learn more about the woman who died in their rooms. Tracing her to a cheap boarding house, he discovers that her name was Helmuth. The segment ends just as he begins gathering information about her background.\n\nIn summary, this segment sets up an eerie and compelling mystery involving a ghostly “gray lady” who appears supernaturally from a locked room, followed days later by the sudden death of a woman fitting her description within the same apartment. The narrator’s rational mind grapples with seemingly supernatural phenomena, as he and his wife experience fear, astonishment, and bafflement. The story blends the psychological tension of doubt versus belief with a classic detective puzzle: how could the strange woman enter a locked room and why did the ghostly vision precede her fatal accident? As the narrator resolves to uncover the truth behind the enigmatic Helmuth and the haunting gray apparition, the stage is set for a deeper investigation into the intersection of the spectral and the real."

      "chunk_text": "as any one knew, without friends or relatives in the city. To those who\nsaw her daily she was a harmless, slightly demented woman with money\nenough to live above want, but not enough to warrant her boasting talk\nabout the rich things she was going to buy some day and the beautiful\npresents she would soon be in a position to give away. The money found\non her person was sufficient to bury her, but no papers were in her\npossession, nor any letters calculated to throw light upon her past\nlife.\nHer lameness had been caused by paralysis, but the date of her attack\nwas not known.\nFinding no clue in this to what I wished to learn, I went back to our\nold rooms, which had not been let since our departure, and sought\nfor one there, and, strangely enough, I found it. I thought I knew\neverything there was to be known about the apartment we had lived in\ntwo months, but one little fact had escaped me which, under the scrutiny\nthat I now gave it, became apparent. This was simply that the key which\nopened the hall door of the bedroom and which we had seldom if ever used\nwas not as old a key as that of the corresponding door in the parlor,\nand this fact, small as it was, led me to make inquiries.\nThe result was that I learned something about the couple who had\npreceded us in the use of these rooms. They were of middle age and of\ngreat personal elegance, but uncertain pay, the husband being nothing\nmore nor less than a professional gambler. Their name was L'Hommedieu.\nWhen I first heard of them, I thought that Mrs. L'Hommedieu might be the\nMrs. Helmuth in whose history I was so interested, but from all I could\nlearn she was a very different sort of person. Mrs. L'Hommedieu was gay,\ndashing and capable of making a show out of a flimsy silk a shop-girl\nwould hesitate to wear. Yet she looked distinguished and wore her\ncheap jewelry with more grace than many a woman her diamonds. I would,\nconsequently, have dropped this inquiry if some one had not remarked\nupon her having had a paralytic stroke after leaving the house. This,\ntogether with the fact that the key to the rear door, which I had found\nreplaced by a new one, had been taken away by her and never returned,\nconnected her so indubitably with my mysterious visitor that I resolved\nto pursue my investigations into Mrs. L'Hommedieu's past.\nFor this purpose I sought out a quaint little maiden-lady living on the\ntop floor, who, I was told, knew more about the L'Hommedieus than any\none in the building. Miss Winterburn, whose acquaintance I had failed\nto make while residing in the house, was a fluttering, eager, affable\nperson, whose one delight was, as I soon found, to talk about the\nL'Homme-dieus. Of the story she related I give as much as I can of it in\nher own words.\n\"I was never their equal,\" said she, \"but Mrs. L'Hommedieu was lonely,\nand, having no friends in town, was good enough to admit me to her\nparlor now and then and even to allow me to accompany her to the theater\nwhen her husband was away on one of his mysterious visits. I never liked\nMr. L'Homme-dieu, but I did like her. She was so different from me, and,\nwhen I first knew her, so gay and so full of conversation. But after\nawhile she changed and was either feverishly cheerful or morbidly sad,\nso that my visits caused me more pain than pleasure. The reason for\nthese changes in her was patent to everybody. Though her husband was a\nhandsome man, he was as unprincipled as he was unfortunate. He gambled.\nThis she once admitted to me, and while at long intervals he met with\nsome luck he more often returned dispirited and with that hungry,\nravening look you expect to see in a wolf cheated of its prey.\n\"I used to be afraid he would strike her after some one of these\ndisappointments, but I do not think he ever did. She had a determined\ncharacter of her own, and there have been times when I have thought he\nwas as much afraid of her as she was of him. I became sure of this\nafter one night. Mrs. L'Hommedieu and myself were having a little supper\ntogether in the front parlor you have so lately occupied. It was a\nvery ordinary supper, for the L'Hommedieus' purse had run low, and Mrs.\nL'Hommedieu was not the woman to spend much at any time on her eating.\nIt was palatable, however, and had been cooked by us both together, and\nI was enjoying it and would have enjoyed it more if Mrs. L'Hommedieu had\nhad more appetite. But she ate scarcely anything and seemed very anxious\nand unhappy, though she laughed now and then with sudden gusts of mirth\ntoo hysterical to be real. It was not late, and yet we were both very\nmuch surprised when there came a knock at the door, followed by the\nentrance of a visitor.\n\"Mrs. L'Hommedieu, who is always _la grande dame_, rose without apparent\nembarrassment to meet the gentleman who entered, though I knew she could\nnot help but feel keenly the niggardly appearance of the board she left\nwith such grace. The stranger--he was certainly a stranger; this I could\nsee by the formality of her manner--was a gentleman of urbane bearing\nand a general air of prosperity.\n\"I remember every word that passed.\n\"'My name is Lafarge,' said he. 'I am, or rather have been, under great\nobligations to your husband, and I have come to discharge my debt. Is he\nat home?'\n\"Mrs. L'Hommedieu's eye, which had sparkled at his name, dropped\nsuddenly as he put the final question.\n\"'I am sorry,' she returned after a moment of embarrassment, 'but my\nhusband is very seldom home evenings. If you could come about noon some\nday'--\n\"'Thank you,' said he, with a bright smile, 'but I will finish my\nbusiness now and with you, seeing that Mr. L'Hommedieu is not at home.\nYears ago--I am sure you have heard your husband mention my name--I\nborrowed quite a sum of money from him, which I have never paid. You\nrecall the amount, no doubt?'\n\"'I have heard Mr. L'Hommedieu say it was a thousand dollars,' she\nreplied, with a sudden fluttering of her hands indicative of great\nexcitement.\n\"'That is the sum,' he allowed, either not noticing me or thinking me\ntoo insignificant to be considered. 'I regret to have kept him so long\nout of it, but I have not forgotten to add the interest in making out\nthis statement of my indebtedness, and if you will look over this paper\nand acknowledge its correctness I will leave the equivalent of my debt\nhere and now, for I sail for Europe to-morrow morning and wish to have\nall my affairs in order before leaving.'\n\"Mrs. L'Hommedieu, who looked ready to faint from excess of feeling,\nsummoned up her whole strength, looking so beautiful as she did so, that\none forgot the ribbons on her sleeves were no longer fresh and that the\nsilk dress she wore hung in the very limpest of folds.\n\"'I am obliged to you,' she said in a tone from which she strove in vain\nto suppress all eagerness. 'And if I may speak for Mr. L'Hommedieu he\nwill be as grateful for your remembrance of us as for the money you so\nkindly offer to return to him.'\n\"The stranger bowed low and took out a folded paper, which he handed\nher. He was not deceived, I am sure, by her grand airs, and knew as well\nas I did that no woman ever stood in greater need of money. But nothing\nin his manner betrayed this knowledge.\n\"'It is a bond I give you,' he now explained. 'As you will see, it has\ncoupons attached to it, which you can cash at any time.

Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-1):\nIn the opening segment of the detective story *The Gray Madam*, the narrator recounts a strange and unsettling experience that he and his wife, Lydia, endure while lodging in an apartment on Twenty-seventh Street. The narrator, an otherwise rational man who dismisses spiritual phenomena, is confronted with an event that challenges his skepticism and draws him into a mysterious and eerie sequence of occurrences.\n\nThe story begins with the narrator and his wife living comfortably in their rented apartments, which they have occupied for about two months of a three-month lease. Their living quarters consist of a back room used as a bedroom and a front parlor, connected by two large mahogany folding doors that usually stand half open. The narrator notes that they rarely entertain visitors, so these doors remain mostly open for convenience.\n\nOne morning, as the narrator prepares to leave for breakfast, he steps into the parlor, leaving his wife lying ill in bed in the adjoining back room. As he is about to leave—around nine o’clock—he becomes aware of a presence behind him. Turning around, he is astonished to see a strange woman emerging from his wife’s room. This is bewildering because the bedroom door, through which the woman must have passed, is always kept locked, and the narrator had just exited from that very room himself moments earlier.\n\nFrozen in astonishment, the narrator does not immediately speak or move. The mysterious woman passes before him quietly and mechanically, as if oblivious to his presence and his call of “Madam!” He manages to touch her hand and feels the texture of her wool dress. Intrigued and confused, he opens the front door quickly to see if she is still outside but finds no one on the steps or the sidewalk. He is left questioning both his sanity and the reality of the encounter, wondering whether it might be a hallucination or some other rational explanation.\n\nSeeking confirmation, he looks for the hall-boy to inquire if anyone has seen the woman, but the boy is absent, leaving the narrator without a witness. Returning to his rooms, he finds his wife sitting up in bed, visibly shaken and astonished. Lydia confirms that she too saw the woman, passing through the folding doors. She describes the figure vividly—a “gray woman, all gray,” dressed in a veil or drapery, resembling a ghost from their readings, and notes that the woman appeared slightly lame. Lydia is frightened and questions whether she is ill enough to imagine such things.\n\nThe narrator reassures her that she must have been dreaming, emphasizing that the bedroom door was locked and that no woman could have entered without their knowledge. Still, the striking similarity between the woman Lydia described and the apparition the narrator himself witnessed defies easy explanation. The couple is left pondering whether they had both seen a “wraith,” possibly a spiritual manifestation.\n\nThree days later, on Friday, an event occurs that appears to confirm the mysterious encounter. The narrator returns from downtown to find a crowd gathered outside the lodging house, watching as a middle-aged woman, severely injured in an accident, is carried into their rooms. The woman is wrapped in a long black cloak, which later falls away to reveal a decent black dress. She is placed on their bed and tended to, but she suffers grievous head injuries and eventually succumbs.\n\nBefore her death, the woman gives a remarkable look of recognition and almost delight as she glances about. She points toward an empty space before her and then dies suddenly. Observing this, the narrator notices that his wife’s expression reveals deeper concern than anticipated. Lydia picks up a long gray veil that had fallen from the woman’s cloak and arranges it about her face, looking meaningfully at her husband.\n\nLydia whispers that the veil and the woman correspond exactly to the mysterious “gray lady” she had seen days before when ill. The vision was a forewarning of the tragic incident that took place in their rooms. This realization terrifies Lydia, who declares that she will not spend another night there, and the couple promptly leaves the apartment.\n\nDespite the emotional impact, the narrator struggles with superstition and rationality. He admits that he is not a superstitious man and tries to find a logical explanation for the unexplainable event. He considers the possibility that the first woman they saw was not a ghost but the same real woman who later died in their rooms. The key to this understanding lies in the woman’s cloak, which is black on one side and lined with gray on the other.\n\nThe narrator reasons that the cloak, when worn black-side out with a black veil, would appear as a discreetly dressed woman, but if reversed and combined with the long gray veil, it would produce the spectral gray appearance he and his wife witnessed. The cloak could be turned quickly, allowing the woman to present different appearances and thus explain why the narrator saw only a black-cloaked figure outside after the first sighting.\n\nHowever, the mystery of how the woman could have entered their locked bedroom remains unresolved. The front door to the hall was open, and the parlor door was also open, but there would have been no way for the woman to slip by unnoticed, given the narrator’s position facing the door the entire time. This locked door into the bedroom is a central enigma.\n\nDetermined to solve the puzzle and relieve his wife’s anxiety, the narrator decides to investigate further. He begins by trying to learn more about the woman who died in their rooms. Tracing her to a cheap boarding house, he discovers that her name was Helmuth. The segment ends just as he begins gathering information about her background.\n\nIn summary, this segment sets up an eerie and compelling mystery involving a ghostly “gray lady” who appears supernaturally from a locked room, followed days later by the sudden death of a woman fitting her description within the same apartment. The narrator’s rational mind grapples with seemingly supernatural phenomena, as he and his wife experience fear, astonishment, and bafflement. The story blends the psychological tension of doubt versus belief with a classic detective puzzle: how could the strange woman enter a locked room and why did the ghostly vision precede her fatal accident? As the narrator resolves to uncover the truth behind the enigmatic Helmuth and the haunting gray apparition, the stage is set for a deeper investigation into the intersection of the spectral and the real.\n\nCurrent segment (part 2):\nas any one knew, without friends or relatives in the city. To those who\nsaw her daily she was a harmless, slightly demented woman with money\nenough to live above want, but not enough to warrant her boasting talk\nabout the rich things she was going to buy some day and the beautiful\npresents she would soon be in a position to give away. The money found\non her person was sufficient to bury her, but no papers were in her\npossession, nor any letters calculated to throw light upon her past\nlife.\nHer lameness had been caused by paralysis, but the date of her attack\nwas not known.\nFinding no clue in this to what I wished to learn, I went back to our\nold rooms, which had not been let since our departure, and sought\nfor one there, and, strangely enough, I found it. I thought I knew\neverything there was to be known about the apartment we had lived in\ntwo months, but one little fact had escaped me which, under the scrutiny\nthat I now gave it, became apparent. This was simply that the key which\nopened the hall door of the bedroom and which we had seldom if ever used\nwas not as old a key as that of the corresponding door in the parlor,\nand this fact, small as it was, led me to make inquiries.\nThe result was that I learned something about the couple who had\npreceded us in the use of these rooms. They were of middle age and of\ngreat personal elegance, but uncertain pay, the husband being nothing\nmore nor less than a professional gambler. Their name was L'Hommedieu.\nWhen I first heard of them, I thought that Mrs. L'Hommedieu might be the\nMrs. Helmuth in whose history I was so interested, but from all I could\nlearn she was a very different sort of person. Mrs. L'Hommedieu was gay,\ndashing and capable of making a show out of a flimsy silk a shop-girl\nwould hesitate to wear. Yet she looked distinguished and wore her\ncheap jewelry with more grace than many a woman her diamonds. I would,\nconsequently, have dropped this inquiry if some one had not remarked\nupon her having had a paralytic stroke after leaving the house. This,\ntogether with the fact that the key to the rear door, which I had found\nreplaced by a new one, had been taken away by her and never returned,\nconnected her so indubitably with my mysterious visitor that I resolved\nto pursue my investigations into Mrs. L'Hommedieu's past.\nFor this purpose I sought out a quaint little maiden-lady living on the\ntop floor, who, I was told, knew more about the L'Hommedieus than any\none in the building. Miss Winterburn, whose acquaintance I had failed\nto make while residing in the house, was a fluttering, eager, affable\nperson, whose one delight was, as I soon found, to talk about the\nL'Homme-dieus. Of the story she related I give as much as I can of it in\nher own words.\n\"I was never their equal,\" said she, \"but Mrs. L'Hommedieu was lonely,\nand, having no friends in town, was good enough to admit me to her\nparlor now and then and even to allow me to accompany her to the theater\nwhen her husband was away on one of his mysterious visits. I never liked\nMr. L'Homme-dieu, but I did like her. She was so different from me, and,\nwhen I first knew her, so gay and so full of conversation. But after\nawhile she changed and was either feverishly cheerful or morbidly sad,\nso that my visits caused me more pain than pleasure. The reason for\nthese changes in her was patent to everybody. Though her husband was a\nhandsome man, he was as unprincipled as he was unfortunate. He gambled.\nThis she once admitted to me, and while at long intervals he met with\nsome luck he more often returned dispirited and with that hungry,\nravening look you expect to see in a wolf cheated of its prey.\n\"I used to be afraid he would strike her after some one of these\ndisappointments, but I do not think he ever did. She had a determined\ncharacter of her own, and there have been times when I have thought he\nwas as much afraid of her as she was of him. I became sure of this\nafter one night. Mrs. L'Hommedieu and myself were having a little supper\ntogether in the front parlor you have so lately occupied. It was a\nvery ordinary supper, for the L'Hommedieus' purse had run low, and Mrs.\nL'Hommedieu was not the woman to spend much at any time on her eating.\nIt was palatable, however, and had been cooked by us both together, and\nI was enjoying it and would have enjoyed it more if Mrs. L'Hommedieu had\nhad more appetite. But she ate scarcely anything and seemed very anxious\nand unhappy, though she laughed now and then with sudden gusts of mirth\ntoo hysterical to be real. It was not late, and yet we were both very\nmuch surprised when there came a knock at the door, followed by the\nentrance of a visitor.\n\"Mrs. L'Hommedieu, who is always _la grande dame_, rose without apparent\nembarrassment to meet the gentleman who entered, though I knew she could\nnot help but feel keenly the niggardly appearance of the board she left\nwith such grace. The stranger--he was certainly a stranger; this I could\nsee by the formality of her manner--was a gentleman of urbane bearing\nand a general air of prosperity.\n\"I remember every word that passed.\n\"'My name is Lafarge,' said he. 'I am, or rather have been, under great\nobligations to your husband, and I have come to discharge my debt. Is he\nat home?'\n\"Mrs. L'Hommedieu's eye, which had sparkled at his name, dropped\nsuddenly as he put the final question.\n\"'I am sorry,' she returned after a moment of embarrassment, 'but my\nhusband is very seldom home evenings. If you could come about noon some\nday'--\n\"'Thank you,' said he, with a bright smile, 'but I will finish my\nbusiness now and with you, seeing that Mr. L'Hommedieu is not at home.\nYears ago--I am sure you have heard your husband mention my name--I\nborrowed quite a sum of money from him, which I have never paid. You\nrecall the amount, no doubt?'\n\"'I have heard Mr. L'Hommedieu say it was a thousand dollars,' she\nreplied, with a sudden fluttering of her hands indicative of great\nexcitement.\n\"'That is the sum,' he allowed, either not noticing me or thinking me\ntoo insignificant to be considered. 'I regret to have kept him so long\nout of it, but I have not forgotten to add the interest in making out\nthis statement of my indebtedness, and if you will look over this paper\nand acknowledge its correctness I will leave the equivalent of my debt\nhere and now, for I sail for Europe to-morrow morning and wish to have\nall my affairs in order before leaving.'\n\"Mrs. L'Hommedieu, who looked ready to faint from excess of feeling,\nsummoned up her whole strength, looking so beautiful as she did so, that\none forgot the ribbons on her sleeves were no longer fresh and that the\nsilk dress she wore hung in the very limpest of folds.\n\"'I am obliged to you,' she said in a tone from which she strove in vain\nto suppress all eagerness. 'And if I may speak for Mr. L'Hommedieu he\nwill be as grateful for your remembrance of us as for the money you so\nkindly offer to return to him.'\n\"The stranger bowed low and took out a folded paper, which he handed\nher. He was not deceived, I am sure, by her grand airs, and knew as well\nas I did that no woman ever stood in greater need of money. But nothing\nin his manner betrayed this knowledge.\n\"'It is a bond I give you,' he now explained. 'As you will see, it has\ncoupons attached to it, which you can cash at any time. It will prove as\nvaluable to you as so much ready money and possibly more convenient.'\n\"And with just this hint, which I took as significant of his complete\nunderstanding of her position, he took her receipt and politely left the\nhouse.\n\"Once alone with me who am nobody, her joy had full vent.

      "summary": "In the continuation of the detective narrative *The Gray Madam*, the story deepens its exploration into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the apparition of a spectral “gray lady” and the subsequent death of a woman fitting her description in the narrator’s former apartments. Building on the initial segment in which the narrator and his wife Lydia witness a ghost-like figure emerging from a locked bedroom door, followed days later by the tragic death of a woman named Helmuth who bore a striking resemblance to the apparition, the current segment focuses on the narrator’s determined investigation into the identity and past of this enigmatic woman.\n\nHaving established in the previous part that the woman found dead in their rooms was a slightly demented, solitary figure with no known relatives or friends in the city, and suffering from paralysis-induced lameness, the narrator's inquiry reveals very little concrete information. Helmuth seemed harmless but somewhat disconnected from reality, living modestly with just enough money to cover her burial. However, she left no personal papers or letters that might clarify her history. The narrator finds himself frustrated by this lack of evidence and returns to the now-vacant apartment, which had remained empty since their departure, to seek clues there.\n\nWhile inspecting the rooms once more, the narrator notices a significant detail he had overlooked: the key to the bedroom’s hall door, which had been locked during the apparition incident, was different from the parlor door key. Intriguingly, this bedroom door key was newer. Sensing this discrepancy could be crucial, he probes further, uncovering information about the previous tenants of these rooms— a middle-aged couple named the L’Hommedieus, who had lived there just before the narrator and his wife. The couple was characterized by elegance, but their financial situation was unstable, as the husband was a professional gambler.\n\nInitially, the narrator speculates whether Mrs. L’Hommedieu might be the enigmatic Mrs. Helmuth, but accounts of Mrs. L’Hommedieu show her to be distinctly different—she was lively, glamorous despite her modest means, and known for her graceful demeanor even in cheap finery. Nonetheless, a critical link emerges: Mrs. L’Hommedieu had suffered a paralytic stroke, which relates to the paralysis that caused Helmuth’s lameness. Also, the new key to the bedroom door had been introduced by Mrs. L’Hommedieu and taken away when she left, suggesting her direct connection to the mysterious entrance to the locked room. These revelations prompt the narrator to delve deeper into the L’Hommedieus’ story, thinking that Mrs. L’Hommedieu could be the ghostly visitor or connected to the woman who died in their rooms.\n\nTo gather further insights, the narrator seeks out Miss Winterburn, an elderly maiden lady living in the same building who was well acquainted with the L’Hommedieu couple. Miss Winterburn describes Mrs. L’Hommedieu as a lonely but generous woman, who, despite lacking friends within the city, occasionally allowed Miss Winterburn into her parlor and even to accompany her to the theater. She paints a picture of a woman whose mood fluctuated wildly—often swinging between exaggerated cheerfulness and deep melancholy—largely explained by the troubles caused by her husband’s gambling.\n\nMr. L’Hommedieu, according to Miss Winterburn, was a handsome but unscrupulous gambler whose luck came and went. His character inspired a mix of fear and control between the spouses, with Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s determined temperament perhaps intimidating him as much as his reckless lifestyle distressed her. Miss Winterburn recounts an intimate, revealing incident involving a supper shared with Mrs. L’Hommedieu in the front parlor of the narrator’s former apartment, not long before the couple left.\n\nDuring this supper, Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s anxious mood and efforts to maintain grace amidst financial scarcity become evident. Suddenly, a visitor named Lafarge arrives—a gentleman with a polished, prosperous appearance. He claims to be under obligations to Mr. L’Hommedieu and has come to settle a debt. Despite Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s initial embarrassment, this debt settlement represented a moment of immense relief and joy for her. Lafarge presents her with a bond as repayment for a loan of one thousand dollars that Mr. L’Hommedieu had extended to him years earlier. The bond was significant, complete with interest and redeemable coupons, promising her a source of income in the future.\n\nOverwhelmed with emotion, Mrs. L’Hommedieu confides in Miss Winterburn that she fears her husband discovering this money, since his suspicious nature and gambling addiction might cause him to squander it, leaving her again in financial peril. Although urged to entrust the bond to her friend’s safekeeping for protection, Mrs. L’Hommedieu ultimately decides to keep the bond herself, fearing the responsibility might be too great for Miss Winterburn.\n\nThe scene abruptly ends as Mr. L’Hommedieu bursts into the room unexpectedly, derailing their confidences. This moment suggests underlying tensions and secrets within the household, possibly illuminating motives and pressures that fed into the tragic events associated with the gray lady apparition and Mrs. Helmuth’s death.\n\nWhen synthesizing the two parts, *The Gray Madam* evolves into a complex narrative merging eerie supernatural elements with a grounded detective inquiry. The initial ghostly encounter in a clearly locked room sets off a chain of events prompting the narrator to confront the intersection of spectral sight and grim reality. The discovery that the woman who died in their apartment had ties to an elusive, high-class but troubled couple, whose livelihood was unstable due to gambling, provides a societal and psychological backdrop to the mystery.\n\nThe narrator’s observations about the keys and the doors introduce the central locked-room puzzle: how could the mysterious woman have passed through an apparently locked door undetected? The revelation that the bedroom key was changed by the previous tenant, Mrs. L’Hommedieu—who also suffered paralysis, liked to maintain appearances despite hardship, and possessed concealed funds—cements her role in the story’s unfolding mystery. \n\nMiss Winterburn’s testimony enriches the character portrait of Mrs. L’Hommedieu as a lonely but proud woman ensnared in distress both financial and emotional, whose fragile state and attempts at secrecy hint at hidden dramas possibly connected to the gray apparition and the eventual fatal accident.\n\nThis segment underscores themes of concealment—both physical, in locked doors and hidden keys, and emotional, in veiled lives and secret debts—while maintaining a suspenseful narrative of discovery. The narrator’s skeptical yet curious mindset drives the story forward, revealing a layered investigation that mixes the unusual with the mundane, the spectral with human frailty. As the story stands at the close of this segment, the narrator is poised to unravel the intricate past of the L’Hommedieu couple and their links to the haunting presence of the gray madam, promising deeper revelations to follow in the concluding segments.\n\nIn sum, these chapters portray a haunting detective tale where an inexplicable ghost sighting foreshadows a tragic death; where the mystery lies as much in human secrets and suffering as in supernatural phenomena; and where the narrator’s quest to understand the past occupants of his former apartment builds the foundation for uncovering the truth behind the spectral gray lady, locked doors, and untimely demise."

Gone!' he cried, ignoring me as completely as had Mr. Lafarge.\n'Not a dollar left; not even my studs! See!'

'Yet if I had had a dollar more or\neven a ring worth a dollar or so I might have---- Theresa, have you any\nmoney at all?

'No!' said she, and shifting her\ngaze she turned it meaningly upon me.\n\"He misunderstood this movement. Thinking it simply a reminder of my\npresence, he turned and, with his false but impressive show of courtesy,\nmade me a low bow. Then he forgot me utterly again, and facing his wife,\ngrowled out:\n\"'Where are you going to get breakfast then? You don't look like a woman\nwho expects to starve!'\n\"It was a fatal remark, for, do what she would, she could not prevent a\nslight smile of disdain, and, seeing it, he kept his eyes riveted on her\nface till her uneasiness became manifest. Instantly his suspicion took\nform, and, surveying her still more fixedly, he espied a corner of the\nprecious paper protruding slightly above her corsage. To snatch it\nout, open it and realize its value was the work of a moment. Her cry of\ndismay and his shout of mad triumph rang out simultaneously, and never\nhave I seen such an ebullition of opposing passions as I was made\nwitness to as his hand closed over this small fortune and their staring\neyes met in the mortal struggle they had now entered upon for its\nultimate possession.\n\"She was the first to speak. 'It was given to me; it was meant for me.\nIf I keep it, both of us will profit by it, but if you----'\n\"He did not wait for her to finish. 'Where did you get it?' he cried.\n'I can break the bank with what I can raise on this bond at the club.\nDarraugh's in town. You know what that means. Luck's in the air, and\nwith an hundred dollars--But I've no time to talk. I came for a dollar,\na fifty-cent piece, a dime even, and I go back with a bond worth----'\n\"But she was already between him and the door. 'You will never carry\nthat bond out of this house,' she whispered in the tone which goes\nfurther than any cry. 'I have not held it in my hand to see it follow\nevery other good thing I have had in life. I will not, Henry. Take that\nbond and sink it as you have all the rest and I fall at your feet a dead\nwoman. I will never survive the destruction of my last hope.'\n\"He was cowed--for a moment, that is; she looked so superb and so\ndetermined. Then all that was mean and despicable in his thinly veneered\nnature came to the surface, and, springing forward with an oath, he was\nabout to push her aside, when, without the moving of a finger on her\npart, he reeled back, recovered himself, caught at a chair, missed it\nand fell heavily to the floor.\n\"'My God, I thank thee!' was the exclamation with which she broke\nfrom the trance of terror into which she had been thrown by his sudden\nattempt to pass her; and without a glance at his face, which to me\nlooked like the face of a dead man, she tore the paper from his hand and\nstood looking about her with a wild and searching gaze, in the desperate\nhope that somehow the walls would open and offer her a safe place of\nconcealment for the precious sheet of paper. Meanwhile I had crept near\nthe prostrate man. He was breathing, but was perfectly unconscious.\n\"'Don't you mean to do something for him?' I asked. 'He may die.'\n\"She met my question with the dazed air of one suddenly awakened. 'No,\nhe'll not die, but he'll not come to for some minutes, and this must be\nhidden first. But where? where? I cannot trust it on my person or in any\nplace a man like him would search. I must devise some means--ah!'\n\"With this final exclamation she had dashed into the other room. I did\nnot see where she went--I did not want to--but I soon realized she was\nworking somewhere in a desperate hurry. I could hear her breath coming\nin quick, short pants as I bent over her husband, waiting for him to\nrouse and hating my inaction even while I succumbed to it.\n\"Suddenly she was back in the parlor again, and to my surprise passed\nimmediately to the little table in the corner where we had sat at\nsupper. We had had for our simple refreshment that homeliest of all\ndishes, boiled milk thickened with flour. There was still some left in a\nbowl, and taking this away with her, she called back hoarsely:\n\"'Pray that he does not come to till I have finished. It will be the\nbest prayer you ever made.'\n\"She told me afterward that he was subject to these attacks and that she\nhad long ceased to be alarmed by them. But to me the sight of this man\nlying there so helpless, was horrible and, though I hated him and pitied\nher, I scarcely knew what to wish. While battling with my desire to run\nand the feeling of loyalty which held me kneeling at that man's side, I\nheard her speak again, this time in an even and slightly hard tone: 'Now\nyou may dash a glass of cold water in his face. I am prepared to meet\nhim. Happily his memory fails him after these attacks. I may succeed in\nmaking him believe that the bond he saw was one of his fancies.'\n\"'Had you not better throw the water yourself?' I suggested, getting up\nand meeting her eye very quietly.\n\"She looked at me in wonder, then moved calmly to the table, took the\nglass and dashed a few drops of water into her husband's face. Instantly\nhe began to stir, seeing which I arose without haste, but without any\nunnecessary delay, and quietly took my leave. I could bear no more that\nnight.\n\"Next morning I awoke in a fright. I had dreamed that he had come to my\nroom in search of the bond. But it was only her knock at the door and\nher voice, asking if she might enter at this early hour. It was such a\nrelief I gladly let her in, and she entered with her best air and flung\nherself on my little lounge with the hysterical cry:\n\"'He has sent me up. I told him I ought not to intrude at such an\ninconvenient hour: that you would not have had your breakfast.' (How\ncarelessly she spoke! How hard she tried to keep the hungry note out of\nher voice!) 'But he insisted upon my coming up. I know why. He searched\nme before I left the room, and now he wants to search the room itself.'\n\"'Then he did remember?' I began.\n\"'Yes, he remembers now. I saw it in his eyes as soon as he awoke. But\nhe will not find the bond. That is safe, and some day when I shall have\nescaped his vigilance long enough to get it back again I will use it so\nas to make him as well as myself comfortable. I am not a selfish woman.'\n\"I did not think she was, and I felt pity for her, and so after dressing\nand making her a cup of tea--I can myself do very well without one on\na pinch--I sat down with her, and we chatted for an hour or so quite\ncomfortably. Then she grew so restless and consulted the clock so often\nthat I tried to soothe her by remarking that it was not an easy task he\nhad set himself, at which she laughed in a mysterious way, but failed to\ngrow less anxious till our suspense was cut short by the appearance of\nthe janitor with a message from Mr. L'Hommedieu.\n\"'Mr. L'Hommedieu's compliments,' said he, 'and he hopes Mrs.\nL'Hommedieu will make herself comfortable and not think of coming down.\nHe is doing everything that is necessary and will soon be through. You\ncan rest quite easy, ma'am.'\n\"'What does he mean?' marveled the poor woman as the janitor\ndisappeared. 'Is he spending all this time ransacking the rooms? I wish\nI dared disobey him. I wish I dared go down.'\n\"But her courage was not equal to an open disregard of his wishes, and\nshe had to subdue her impatience and wait for a summons that did not\ncome till near two o'clock. Then Mr. L'Hommedieu himself appeared with\nher hat and mantle on his arm.\n\"'My dear,' said he as she rose, haggard with excitement, to meet him,\n'I have brought your wraps with me that you may go directly from here to\nour new home.

      "prompt": "Continue summarizing Detective story 'The Gray Madam' by Unknown. This is part 3 of 4 segments. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-2):\nIn the continuation of the detective narrative *The Gray Madam*, the story deepens its exploration into the mysterious circumstances surrounding the apparition of a spectral “gray lady” and the subsequent death of a woman fitting her description in the narrator’s former apartments. Building on the initial segment in which the narrator and his wife Lydia witness a ghost-like figure emerging from a locked bedroom door, followed days later by the tragic death of a woman named Helmuth who bore a striking resemblance to the apparition, the current segment focuses on the narrator’s determined investigation into the identity and past of this enigmatic woman.\n\nHaving established in the previous part that the woman found dead in their rooms was a slightly demented, solitary figure with no known relatives or friends in the city, and suffering from paralysis-induced lameness, the narrator's inquiry reveals very little concrete information. Helmuth seemed harmless but somewhat disconnected from reality, living modestly with just enough money to cover her burial. However, she left no personal papers or letters that might clarify her history. The narrator finds himself frustrated by this lack of evidence and returns to the now-vacant apartment, which had remained empty since their departure, to seek clues there.\n\nWhile inspecting the rooms once more, the narrator notices a significant detail he had overlooked: the key to the bedroom’s hall door, which had been locked during the apparition incident, was different from the parlor door key. Intriguingly, this bedroom door key was newer. Sensing this discrepancy could be crucial, he probes further, uncovering information about the previous tenants of these rooms— a middle-aged couple named the L’Hommedieus, who had lived there just before the narrator and his wife. The couple was characterized by elegance, but their financial situation was unstable, as the husband was a professional gambler.\n\nInitially, the narrator speculates whether Mrs. L’Hommedieu might be the enigmatic Mrs. Helmuth, but accounts of Mrs. L’Hommedieu show her to be distinctly different—she was lively, glamorous despite her modest means, and known for her graceful demeanor even in cheap finery. Nonetheless, a critical link emerges: Mrs. L’Hommedieu had suffered a paralytic stroke, which relates to the paralysis that caused Helmuth’s lameness. Also, the new key to the bedroom door had been introduced by Mrs. L’Hommedieu and taken away when she left, suggesting her direct connection to the mysterious entrance to the locked room. These revelations prompt the narrator to delve deeper into the L’Hommedieus’ story, thinking that Mrs. L’Hommedieu could be the ghostly visitor or connected to the woman who died in their rooms.\n\nTo gather further insights, the narrator seeks out Miss Winterburn, an elderly maiden lady living in the same building who was well acquainted with the L’Hommedieu couple. Miss Winterburn describes Mrs. L’Hommedieu as a lonely but generous woman, who, despite lacking friends within the city, occasionally allowed Miss Winterburn into her parlor and even to accompany her to the theater. She paints a picture of a woman whose mood fluctuated wildly—often swinging between exaggerated cheerfulness and deep melancholy—largely explained by the troubles caused by her husband’s gambling.\n\nMr. L’Hommedieu, according to Miss Winterburn, was a handsome but unscrupulous gambler whose luck came and went. His character inspired a mix of fear and control between the spouses, with Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s determined temperament perhaps intimidating him as much as his reckless lifestyle distressed her. Miss Winterburn recounts an intimate, revealing incident involving a supper shared with Mrs. L’Hommedieu in the front parlor of the narrator’s former apartment, not long before the couple left.\n\nDuring this supper, Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s anxious mood and efforts to maintain grace amidst financial scarcity become evident. Suddenly, a visitor named Lafarge arrives—a gentleman with a polished, prosperous appearance. He claims to be under obligations to Mr. L’Hommedieu and has come to settle a debt. Despite Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s initial embarrassment, this debt settlement represented a moment of immense relief and joy for her. Lafarge presents her with a bond as repayment for a loan of one thousand dollars that Mr. L’Hommedieu had extended to him years earlier. The bond was significant, complete with interest and redeemable coupons, promising her a source of income in the future.\n\nOverwhelmed with emotion, Mrs. L’Hommedieu confides in Miss Winterburn that she fears her husband discovering this money, since his suspicious nature and gambling addiction might cause him to squander it, leaving her again in financial peril. Although urged to entrust the bond to her friend’s safekeeping for protection, Mrs. L’Hommedieu ultimately decides to keep the bond herself, fearing the responsibility might be too great for Miss Winterburn.\n\nThe scene abruptly ends as Mr. L’Hommedieu bursts into the room unexpectedly, derailing their confidences. This moment suggests underlying tensions and secrets within the household, possibly illuminating motives and pressures that fed into the tragic events associated with the gray lady apparition and Mrs. Helmuth’s death.\n\nWhen synthesizing the two parts, *The Gray Madam* evolves into a complex narrative merging eerie supernatural elements with a grounded detective inquiry. The initial ghostly encounter in a clearly locked room sets off a chain of events prompting the narrator to confront the intersection of spectral sight and grim reality. The discovery that the woman who died in their apartment had ties to an elusive, high-class but troubled couple, whose livelihood was unstable due to gambling, provides a societal and psychological backdrop to the mystery.\n\nThe narrator’s observations about the keys and the doors introduce the central locked-room puzzle: how could the mysterious woman have passed through an apparently locked door undetected? The revelation that the bedroom key was changed by the previous tenant, Mrs. L’Hommedieu—who also suffered paralysis, liked to maintain appearances despite hardship, and possessed concealed funds—cements her role in the story’s unfolding mystery. \n\nMiss Winterburn’s testimony enriches the character portrait of Mrs. L’Hommedieu as a lonely but proud woman ensnared in distress both financial and emotional, whose fragile state and attempts at secrecy hint at hidden dramas possibly connected to the gray apparition and the eventual fatal accident.\n\nThis segment underscores themes of concealment—both physical, in locked doors and hidden keys, and emotional, in veiled lives and secret debts—while maintaining a suspenseful narrative of discovery. The narrator’s skeptical yet curious mindset drives the story forward, revealing a layered investigation that mixes the unusual with the mundane, the spectral with human frailty. As the story stands at the close of this segment, the narrator is poised to unravel the intricate past of the L’Hommedieu couple and their links to the haunting presence of the gray madam, promising deeper revelations to follow in the concluding segments.\n\nIn sum, these chapters portray a haunting detective tale where an inexplicable ghost sighting foreshadows a tragic death; where the mystery lies as much in human secrets and suffering as in supernatural phenomena; and where the narrator’s quest to understand the past occupants of his former apartment builds the foundation for uncovering the truth behind the spectral gray lady, locked doors, and untimely demise.\n\nCurrent segment (part 3):\nexcitement as his wife, only his was the excitement of desperation.\n\"'Gone! Gone!' he cried, ignoring me as completely as had Mr. Lafarge.\n'Not a dollar left; not even my studs! See!' And he pointed to his\nshirt front hanging apart in a way I would never have looked for in this\nreckless but fastidious gentleman. 'Yet if I had had a dollar more or\neven a ring worth a dollar or so I might have---- Theresa, have you any\nmoney at all? A coin now might save us.'\n\"Mrs. L'Hommedieu, who had turned alarmingly pale, drew up her fine\nfigure and resolutely confronted him. 'No!' said she, and shifting her\ngaze she turned it meaningly upon me.\n\"He misunderstood this movement. Thinking it simply a reminder of my\npresence, he turned and, with his false but impressive show of courtesy,\nmade me a low bow. Then he forgot me utterly again, and facing his wife,\ngrowled out:\n\"'Where are you going to get breakfast then? You don't look like a woman\nwho expects to starve!'\n\"It was a fatal remark, for, do what she would, she could not prevent a\nslight smile of disdain, and, seeing it, he kept his eyes riveted on her\nface till her uneasiness became manifest. Instantly his suspicion took\nform, and, surveying her still more fixedly, he espied a corner of the\nprecious paper protruding slightly above her corsage. To snatch it\nout, open it and realize its value was the work of a moment. Her cry of\ndismay and his shout of mad triumph rang out simultaneously, and never\nhave I seen such an ebullition of opposing passions as I was made\nwitness to as his hand closed over this small fortune and their staring\neyes met in the mortal struggle they had now entered upon for its\nultimate possession.\n\"She was the first to speak. 'It was given to me; it was meant for me.\nIf I keep it, both of us will profit by it, but if you----'\n\"He did not wait for her to finish. 'Where did you get it?' he cried.\n'I can break the bank with what I can raise on this bond at the club.\nDarraugh's in town. You know what that means. Luck's in the air, and\nwith an hundred dollars--But I've no time to talk. I came for a dollar,\na fifty-cent piece, a dime even, and I go back with a bond worth----'\n\"But she was already between him and the door. 'You will never carry\nthat bond out of this house,' she whispered in the tone which goes\nfurther than any cry. 'I have not held it in my hand to see it follow\nevery other good thing I have had in life. I will not, Henry. Take that\nbond and sink it as you have all the rest and I fall at your feet a dead\nwoman. I will never survive the destruction of my last hope.'\n\"He was cowed--for a moment, that is; she looked so superb and so\ndetermined. Then all that was mean and despicable in his thinly veneered\nnature came to the surface, and, springing forward with an oath, he was\nabout to push her aside, when, without the moving of a finger on her\npart, he reeled back, recovered himself, caught at a chair, missed it\nand fell heavily to the floor.\n\"'My God, I thank thee!' was the exclamation with which she broke\nfrom the trance of terror into which she had been thrown by his sudden\nattempt to pass her; and without a glance at his face, which to me\nlooked like the face of a dead man, she tore the paper from his hand and\nstood looking about her with a wild and searching gaze, in the desperate\nhope that somehow the walls would open and offer her a safe place of\nconcealment for the precious sheet of paper. Meanwhile I had crept near\nthe prostrate man. He was breathing, but was perfectly unconscious.\n\"'Don't you mean to do something for him?' I asked. 'He may die.'\n\"She met my question with the dazed air of one suddenly awakened. 'No,\nhe'll not die, but he'll not come to for some minutes, and this must be\nhidden first. But where? where? I cannot trust it on my person or in any\nplace a man like him would search. I must devise some means--ah!'\n\"With this final exclamation she had dashed into the other room. I did\nnot see where she went--I did not want to--but I soon realized she was\nworking somewhere in a desperate hurry. I could hear her breath coming\nin quick, short pants as I bent over her husband, waiting for him to\nrouse and hating my inaction even while I succumbed to it.\n\"Suddenly she was back in the parlor again, and to my surprise passed\nimmediately to the little table in the corner where we had sat at\nsupper. We had had for our simple refreshment that homeliest of all\ndishes, boiled milk thickened with flour. There was still some left in a\nbowl, and taking this away with her, she called back hoarsely:\n\"'Pray that he does not come to till I have finished. It will be the\nbest prayer you ever made.'\n\"She told me afterward that he was subject to these attacks and that she\nhad long ceased to be alarmed by them. But to me the sight of this man\nlying there so helpless, was horrible and, though I hated him and pitied\nher, I scarcely knew what to wish. While battling with my desire to run\nand the feeling of loyalty which held me kneeling at that man's side, I\nheard her speak again, this time in an even and slightly hard tone: 'Now\nyou may dash a glass of cold water in his face. I am prepared to meet\nhim. Happily his memory fails him after these attacks. I may succeed in\nmaking him believe that the bond he saw was one of his fancies.'\n\"'Had you not better throw the water yourself?' I suggested, getting up\nand meeting her eye very quietly.\n\"She looked at me in wonder, then moved calmly to the table, took the\nglass and dashed a few drops of water into her husband's face. Instantly\nhe began to stir, seeing which I arose without haste, but without any\nunnecessary delay, and quietly took my leave. I could bear no more that\nnight.\n\"Next morning I awoke in a fright. I had dreamed that he had come to my\nroom in search of the bond. But it was only her knock at the door and\nher voice, asking if she might enter at this early hour. It was such a\nrelief I gladly let her in, and she entered with her best air and flung\nherself on my little lounge with the hysterical cry:\n\"'He has sent me up. I told him I ought not to intrude at such an\ninconvenient hour: that you would not have had your breakfast.' (How\ncarelessly she spoke! How hard she tried to keep the hungry note out of\nher voice!) 'But he insisted upon my coming up. I know why. He searched\nme before I left the room, and now he wants to search the room itself.'\n\"'Then he did remember?' I began.\n\"'Yes, he remembers now. I saw it in his eyes as soon as he awoke. But\nhe will not find the bond. That is safe, and some day when I shall have\nescaped his vigilance long enough to get it back again I will use it so\nas to make him as well as myself comfortable. I am not a selfish woman.'\n\"I did not think she was, and I felt pity for her, and so after dressing\nand making her a cup of tea--I can myself do very well without one on\na pinch--I sat down with her, and we chatted for an hour or so quite\ncomfortably. Then she grew so restless and consulted the clock so often\nthat I tried to soothe her by remarking that it was not an easy task he\nhad set himself, at which she laughed in a mysterious way, but failed to\ngrow less anxious till our suspense was cut short by the appearance of\nthe janitor with a message from Mr. L'Hommedieu.\n\"'Mr. L'Hommedieu's compliments,' said he, 'and he hopes Mrs.\nL'Hommedieu will make herself comfortable and not think of coming down.\nHe is doing everything that is necessary and will soon be through. You\ncan rest quite easy, ma'am.'\n\"'What does he mean?' marveled the poor woman as the janitor\ndisappeared. 'Is he spending all this time ransacking the rooms? I wish\nI dared disobey him. I wish I dared go down.'\n\"But her courage was not equal to an open disregard of his wishes, and\nshe had to subdue her impatience and wait for a summons that did not\ncome till near two o'clock. Then Mr. L'Hommedieu himself appeared with\nher hat and mantle on his arm.\n\"'My dear,' said he as she rose, haggard with excitement, to meet him,\n'I have brought your wraps with me that you may go directly from here to\nour new home.

      "summary": "Continuing from the previous segments of *The Gray Madam*, the narrative merges the eerie supernatural occurrence of the spectral gray lady with an intense drama rooted in human frailty, financial desperation, and marital conflict. The story’s detective thread is further enriched by a vivid, dramatic episode that casts new light on the troubled lives of the L’Hommedieu couple, the previous occupants of the narrator's former apartments, and whose story appears intertwined with both the ghostly apparition and the enigmatic death of the woman named Helmuth.\n\nIn the earlier parts, the narrator and his wife Lydia had witnessed the ghostly gray lady emerging mysteriously from a locked bedroom door, followed days later by the tragic discovery of Mrs. Helmuth’s body—an isolated, partially paralysed woman who bore a curious resemblance to the apparition. The narrator’s investigation journeyed into the identities of prior tenants, leading him to learn about the L’Hommedieu couple. Mrs. L’Hommedieu was a once lively and elegant woman, recently debilitated by a paralytic stroke, while Mr. L’Hommedieu was a somewhat unscrupulous professional gambler whose character and gambling misadventures created tension and ruinous financial instability in their household. As the narrator learned, Mrs. L’Hommedieu had introduced a new bedroom key—a critical detail in the locked-room mystery posed by the ghost’s entrance—and she possessed a bond representing a secret fortune that her husband might recklessly squander if discovered.\n\nThe current segment dramatically unveils a pressing and intimate episode in the L’Hommedieu household. It opens with Mr. L’Hommedieu in a state of despair and destitution, having lost all his money, even down to his shirt studs. His desperation is palpable as he pleads for any coin—“a dollar, a fifty-cent piece, a dime even”—to perhaps salvage their dire situation. Mrs. L’Hommedieu confronts him with resolute dignity, bluntly refusing to yield anything and subtly signaling her confidante (the narrator) by shifting her gaze. The emotional tension between them is immediate and intense.\n\nMr. L’Hommedieu then notices a corner of the valuable bond paper protruding from beneath Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s corsage. In a furious struggle, he seizes the bond, realizing its monetary value instantly. This paper—representing some thousand-dollar debt owed to Mr. L’Hommedieu years earlier by a man named Lafarge, now presented as a bond repayable with interest—embodies a last hope for financial redemption. Mrs. L’Hommedieu passionately pleads that the bond was given to her and must be kept safe, arguing that if her husband were to lose or ruin it, she would not survive the despair. She declares that this bond is the final lifeline for their common welfare.\n\nThe conflict escalates when Mr. L’Hommedieu tries to force past her to take the bond and gamble it away, only to suddenly collapse—an episode suggestive of a stroke or epileptic attack, familiar to those around him. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s reaction is a mix of terror and relief. Without hesitation, she removes the bond from his grasp and frantically seeks a secure hiding place for it, fearing that the man might have regained consciousness and attempt to reclaim or destroy it.\n\nDespite the narrator’s presence and concern for Mr. L’Hommedieu’s condition, Mrs. L’Hommedieu insists on protecting the bond first, displaying a steely resolve and an acute awareness of the precariousness of their financial and marital situation. She returns to the little table where a bowl of thickened boiled milk—the simple supper they shared earlier—still sits, and uses it in an apparently last-ditch effort to revive or soothe her husband. Once he shows signs of stirring, the narrator leaves quietly, overwhelmed by the scene’s mixture of pity, hatred, and helplessness.\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. L’Hommedieu visits the narrator, her demeanor a mixture of hysteria and forced composure, reporting that Mr. L’Hommedieu has sent her to search the rooms, presumably in a desperate attempt to find the hidden bond. She confirms that he does recall the bond’s existence and is actively trying to locate it, but that she has successfully hidden it beyond his reach for the time being. She harbors hopes that, once free from his oppressive influence, she can redeem the bond and secure a comfortable life for both of them.\n\nThe narrator spends time with Mrs. L’Hommedieu, witnessing her growing anxiety and restlessness as she awaits her husband’s actions. Their tension culminates when the janitor arrives bearing a message from Mr. L’Hommedieu, advising her to remain in her room and not to worry, as he is conducting a thorough search of the premises himself. Mrs. L’Hommedieu is fearful but feels compelled to obey, anxiously waiting while Mr. L’Hommedieu ransacks the rooms below.\n\nSeveral hours later, Mr. L’Hommedieu returns with Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s hat and mantle—indications that the move is to begin at once. He announces their impending departure from the house and offers to assist her with her wraps, noting that she looks unwell. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s reaction is subdued and brittle, masked in forced calm, revealing a deep exhaustion and resignation.\n\nThis dramatic episode illuminates several crucial elements intertwined with the mystery of the gray madam’s apparition and Mrs. Helmuth's death. First, it highlights the intense emotional and financial pressures crushing the L’Hommedieu marriage. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s paralytic condition, the husband’s gambling addiction, and their mounting desperation paint the portrait of a woman caught in a toxic and unstable household, striving to safeguard a small but precious hope for rescue symbolized by the bond.\n\nSecond, the fierce struggle over the bond underscores the theme of concealment and secrecy threading through the story: the physical hiding of the bond paper, the locked bedroom door whose key was changed, and the personal and emotional defenses Mrs. L’Hommedieu erects against her husband’s recklessness. The bond represents not only money but also dignity, autonomy, and the chance for survival amid mounting ruin.\n\nThird, the violent clash and Mr. L’Hommedieu’s collapse connect to the story’s ongoing exploration of illness, decline, and mortality. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s paralysis and the husband’s sudden seizure metaphorically mirror the stagnation and inevitable decay that haunt the household, correlating with the spectral visits and the tragic death of Mrs. Helmuth in the same rooms.\n\nMoreover, Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s fear that her husband might discover and blow their last hope sets up the desperate conditions that likely contributed to the mysterious events witnessed by the narrator and the eventual fatal accident. The bond, therefore, emerges as a tangible symbol of hope and nightmare alike, a key to understanding the motivations that might have governed the lives and deaths of the individuals connected to the room once occupied by the L’Hommedieus.\n\nOverall, this segment deepens the story’s blend of the supernatural and the psychological, revealing the gray madam’s tragedy not as mere ghostly whimsy but as the haunting embodiment of hidden sorrows, financial ruin, and fractured human relationships. The narrator’s impartial and observant role continues to peel back layers of complexity, as what once appeared purely spectral now takes on an urgent human essence.\n\nIn synthesis, *The Gray Madam* evolves here into a richly woven detective and psychological tale where spectral appearances become portals into the past troubles of its players. The locked-room mystery is not only about physical keys and doors but about secrets held close, moments of desperation, and the fragile boundary between hope and despair. The narrator’s investigations into the L’Hommedieu’s strained marriage, the priceless bond, and the haunted rooms chart a path toward uncovering the truth behind the ghostly gray figure and the death that shadows the story.\n\nAs the narrative stands at the close of this third segment, the stage is set for the final unveiling: how these secrets culminate in tragedy and spectral manifestations, and what ultimate resolutions the narrator might uncover about the fateful gray madam. The human drama behind the haunted rooms promises to dissolve the boundaries between the supernatural and the real, revealing the full story’s chilling, poignant heart."

I cried, with affected gaiety. 'I am\ngoing down with you to the door.' And resolutely ignoring his frown I\ntripped down before them. On the last stair I felt her steps lagging.\nInstantly I seemed to comprehend what was required of me, and, rushing\nforward, I entered the front parlor. He followed close behind me, for\nhow could he know I was not in collusion with her to regain the bond?\nThis gave her one minute by herself in the rear, and in that minute she\nsecured the key which would give her future access to the spot where her\ntreasure lay hidden.\n\"The rest of the story I must give you mainly from hearsay. You must\nunderstand by this time what Mr. L'Hommedieu's scheme was in moving\nthus suddenly. He knew that it would be impossible for him, by the most\nminute and continuous watchfulness, to prevent his wife from\nrecovering the bond while they continued to inhabit the rooms in which,\nnotwithstanding his failure to find it, he had reason to believe\nit still lay concealed. But once in other quarters it would be\ncomparatively easy for him to subject her to a surveillance which\nnot only would prevent her from returning to this house without his\nknowledge, but would lead her to give away her secret by the very\nnatural necessity she would be under of going to the exact spot where\nher treasure lay hid.\n\"It was a cunning plot and showed him to be as able as he was\nunscrupulous. How it worked I will now proceed to tell you. It must\nhave been the next afternoon that the janitor came running up to me--I\nsuppose he had learned by this time that I had more than ordinary\ninterest in these people--to say that Mrs. L'Hommedieu had been in the\nhouse and had been so frightened by a man who had followed her that she\nhad fainted dead away on the floor. Would I go down to her?\n\"I had rather have gone anywhere else, unless it was to prison, but duty\ncannot be shirked, and I followed the man down. But we were too late.\nMrs. L'Hommedieu had recovered and gone away, and the person who had\nfrightened her was also gone, and only the hall-boy remained to give any\nexplanations.\n\"This was what he had to say:\n\"'The man it was who went first. As soon as the lady fell he skipped\nout. I don't think he meant no good here--'\n\"'Did she drop here in the hall?' I asked, unable to restrain my intense\nanxiety.\n\"'Oh, no, ma'am! They was in the back room yonder, which she got in\nsomehow. The man followed her in, sneaking and sneaking like an eel or a\ncop, and she fell right against---'\n\"'Don't tell me where!' I cried. 'I don't want to know where!' And I was\nabout to return up-stairs when I heard a quick, sharp voice behind\nme and realized that Mr. L'Hommedieu had come in and was having some\ndispute with the janitor.\n\"Common prudence led me to listen. He wanted, as was very natural, to\nenter the room where his wife had just been surprised, but the janitor,\nalarmed by the foregoing very irregular proceedings, was disposed to\ndeny his right to do so.\n\"'The furniture is held as a surety,' said he, 'and I have orders---'\n\"But Mr. L'Hommedieu had a spare dollar, and before many minutes had\nelapsed I heard him go into that room and close the door. Of the next\nten minutes and the suspense I felt I need not speak. When he came out\nagain, he looked as if the ground would not hold him.\n\"'I have done some mischief, I fear,' he airily said as he passed by\nthe janitor. 'But I'll pay for it. Don't worry. I'll pay for it and the\nrent, too, to-morrow. You may tell Mrs. Latimer so.' And he was gone,\nleaving us all agape in the hallway.\n\"A minute later we all crept to that room and looked in. Now that he\nhad got the money I for one was determined to know where she had hid it.\nThere was no mistaking the spot. A single glance was enough to show us\nthe paper ripped off from a portion of the wall, revealing a narrow gap\nbehind the baseboard large enough to hold the bond. It was near--\"\n\"Wait!\" I put in as I remembered where the so called Mrs. Helmuth\nhad pointed just before she died. \"Wasn't it at the left of the large\nfolding doors and midway to the wall?\"\n\"How came you to know?\" she asked. \"Did Mrs. Latimer tell you?\" But as I\ndid not answer she soon took up the thread of her narrative again, and,\nsighing softly, said:\n\"The next day came and went, but no Mr. L'Hommedieu appeared; another,\nand I began to grow seriously uneasy; a third, and a dreadful thing\nhappened. Late in the afternoon Mrs. L'Hommedieu, dressed very oddly for\nher, came sliding in at the front door, and with an appealing smile at\nthe hall-boy, who wished but dared not ask her for the key which made\nthese visits possible, glided by to her old rooms, and, finding the door\nunlocked, went softly in. Her appearance is worth description, for it\nshows the pitiful efforts she made at disguise, in the hope, I suppose,\nof escaping the surveillance she was evidently conscious of being under.\nShe was in the habit of wearing on cool days a black circular with\na gray lining. This she had turned inside out so that the gray was\nuppermost, while over her neat black bonnet she had flung a long veil,\nalso gray, which not only hid her face, but gave to her appearance\nan eccentric look as different as possible from her usual aspect. The\nhall-boy, who had never seen her save in showy black or bright colors,\nsaid she looked like a ghost in the daytime, but it was all done for\na purpose, I am sure, and to escape the attention of the man who had\nbefore followed her.

      "prompt": "Continue summarizing Detective story 'The Gray Madam' by Unknown. This is part 4 of 4 segments. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nPrevious summary (parts 1-3):\nContinuing from the previous segments of *The Gray Madam*, the narrative merges the eerie supernatural occurrence of the spectral gray lady with an intense drama rooted in human frailty, financial desperation, and marital conflict. The story’s detective thread is further enriched by a vivid, dramatic episode that casts new light on the troubled lives of the L’Hommedieu couple, the previous occupants of the narrator's former apartments, and whose story appears intertwined with both the ghostly apparition and the enigmatic death of the woman named Helmuth.\n\nIn the earlier parts, the narrator and his wife Lydia had witnessed the ghostly gray lady emerging mysteriously from a locked bedroom door, followed days later by the tragic discovery of Mrs. Helmuth’s body—an isolated, partially paralysed woman who bore a curious resemblance to the apparition. The narrator’s investigation journeyed into the identities of prior tenants, leading him to learn about the L’Hommedieu couple. Mrs. L’Hommedieu was a once lively and elegant woman, recently debilitated by a paralytic stroke, while Mr. L’Hommedieu was a somewhat unscrupulous professional gambler whose character and gambling misadventures created tension and ruinous financial instability in their household. As the narrator learned, Mrs. L’Hommedieu had introduced a new bedroom key—a critical detail in the locked-room mystery posed by the ghost’s entrance—and she possessed a bond representing a secret fortune that her husband might recklessly squander if discovered.\n\nThe current segment dramatically unveils a pressing and intimate episode in the L’Hommedieu household. It opens with Mr. L’Hommedieu in a state of despair and destitution, having lost all his money, even down to his shirt studs. His desperation is palpable as he pleads for any coin—“a dollar, a fifty-cent piece, a dime even”—to perhaps salvage their dire situation. Mrs. L’Hommedieu confronts him with resolute dignity, bluntly refusing to yield anything and subtly signaling her confidante (the narrator) by shifting her gaze. The emotional tension between them is immediate and intense.\n\nMr. L’Hommedieu then notices a corner of the valuable bond paper protruding from beneath Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s corsage. In a furious struggle, he seizes the bond, realizing its monetary value instantly. This paper—representing some thousand-dollar debt owed to Mr. L’Hommedieu years earlier by a man named Lafarge, now presented as a bond repayable with interest—embodies a last hope for financial redemption. Mrs. L’Hommedieu passionately pleads that the bond was given to her and must be kept safe, arguing that if her husband were to lose or ruin it, she would not survive the despair. She declares that this bond is the final lifeline for their common welfare.\n\nThe conflict escalates when Mr. L’Hommedieu tries to force past her to take the bond and gamble it away, only to suddenly collapse—an episode suggestive of a stroke or epileptic attack, familiar to those around him. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s reaction is a mix of terror and relief. Without hesitation, she removes the bond from his grasp and frantically seeks a secure hiding place for it, fearing that the man might have regained consciousness and attempt to reclaim or destroy it.\n\nDespite the narrator’s presence and concern for Mr. L’Hommedieu’s condition, Mrs. L’Hommedieu insists on protecting the bond first, displaying a steely resolve and an acute awareness of the precariousness of their financial and marital situation. She returns to the little table where a bowl of thickened boiled milk—the simple supper they shared earlier—still sits, and uses it in an apparently last-ditch effort to revive or soothe her husband. Once he shows signs of stirring, the narrator leaves quietly, overwhelmed by the scene’s mixture of pity, hatred, and helplessness.\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. L’Hommedieu visits the narrator, her demeanor a mixture of hysteria and forced composure, reporting that Mr. L’Hommedieu has sent her to search the rooms, presumably in a desperate attempt to find the hidden bond. She confirms that he does recall the bond’s existence and is actively trying to locate it, but that she has successfully hidden it beyond his reach for the time being. She harbors hopes that, once free from his oppressive influence, she can redeem the bond and secure a comfortable life for both of them.\n\nThe narrator spends time with Mrs. L’Hommedieu, witnessing her growing anxiety and restlessness as she awaits her husband’s actions. Their tension culminates when the janitor arrives bearing a message from Mr. L’Hommedieu, advising her to remain in her room and not to worry, as he is conducting a thorough search of the premises himself. Mrs. L’Hommedieu is fearful but feels compelled to obey, anxiously waiting while Mr. L’Hommedieu ransacks the rooms below.\n\nSeveral hours later, Mr. L’Hommedieu returns with Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s hat and mantle—indications that the move is to begin at once. He announces their impending departure from the house and offers to assist her with her wraps, noting that she looks unwell. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s reaction is subdued and brittle, masked in forced calm, revealing a deep exhaustion and resignation.\n\nThis dramatic episode illuminates several crucial elements intertwined with the mystery of the gray madam’s apparition and Mrs. Helmuth's death. First, it highlights the intense emotional and financial pressures crushing the L’Hommedieu marriage. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s paralytic condition, the husband’s gambling addiction, and their mounting desperation paint the portrait of a woman caught in a toxic and unstable household, striving to safeguard a small but precious hope for rescue symbolized by the bond.\n\nSecond, the fierce struggle over the bond underscores the theme of concealment and secrecy threading through the story: the physical hiding of the bond paper, the locked bedroom door whose key was changed, and the personal and emotional defenses Mrs. L’Hommedieu erects against her husband’s recklessness. The bond represents not only money but also dignity, autonomy, and the chance for survival amid mounting ruin.\n\nThird, the violent clash and Mr. L’Hommedieu’s collapse connect to the story’s ongoing exploration of illness, decline, and mortality. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s paralysis and the husband’s sudden seizure metaphorically mirror the stagnation and inevitable decay that haunt the household, correlating with the spectral visits and the tragic death of Mrs. Helmuth in the same rooms.\n\nMoreover, Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s fear that her husband might discover and blow their last hope sets up the desperate conditions that likely contributed to the mysterious events witnessed by the narrator and the eventual fatal accident. The bond, therefore, emerges as a tangible symbol of hope and nightmare alike, a key to understanding the motivations that might have governed the lives and deaths of the individuals connected to the room once occupied by the L’Hommedieus.\n\nOverall, this segment deepens the story’s blend of the supernatural and the psychological, revealing the gray madam’s tragedy not as mere ghostly whimsy but as the haunting embodiment of hidden sorrows, financial ruin, and fractured human relationships. The narrator’s impartial and observant role continues to peel back layers of complexity, as what once appeared purely spectral now takes on an urgent human essence.\n\nIn synthesis, *The Gray Madam* evolves here into a richly woven detective and psychological tale where spectral appearances become portals into the past troubles of its players. The locked-room mystery is not only about physical keys and doors but about secrets held close, moments of desperation, and the fragile boundary between hope and despair. The narrator’s investigations into the L’Hommedieu’s strained marriage, the priceless bond, and the haunted rooms chart a path toward uncovering the truth behind the ghostly gray figure and the death that shadows the story.\n\nAs the narrative stands at the close of this third segment, the stage is set for the final unveiling: how these secrets culminate in tragedy and spectral manifestations, and what ultimate resolutions the narrator might uncover about the fateful gray madam. The human drama behind the haunted rooms promises to dissolve the boundaries between the supernatural and the real, revealing the full story’s chilling, poignant heart.\n\nCurrent segment (part 4):\npresent.) 'Our goods are left as a surety, it seems.'\n\"'Half of our goods,' he blandly corrected. 'Would it interest you to\nknow which half?'\n\"'The cunning of this insinuation was matched by the imperturbable shrug\nwith which she replied. 'So a bed has been allowed us and some clothes\nI am satisfied,' at which he bit his lips, vexed at her self-control and\nhis own failure to break it.\n\"'You have not asked where we are going,' he observed as with apparent\nsolicitude he threw her mantle over her shoulders.\n\"The air of lassitude with which she replied bespoke her feeling on that\npoint. 'I have little curiosity,' she said. 'You know I can be happy\nanywhere. And, turning toward me, she moved her lips in a way I\ninterpreted to mean: 'Go below with me. See me out.'\n\"'Say what you have to say to Miss Winter-burn aloud,' he dryly\nsuggested.\n\"'I have nothing to say to Miss Winterburn but thanks,' was her cold\nreply, belied, however, by the trembling of her fingers as she essayed\nto fit on her gloves.\n\"'And those I will receive below!' I cried, with affected gaiety. 'I am\ngoing down with you to the door.' And resolutely ignoring his frown I\ntripped down before them. On the last stair I felt her steps lagging.\nInstantly I seemed to comprehend what was required of me, and, rushing\nforward, I entered the front parlor. He followed close behind me, for\nhow could he know I was not in collusion with her to regain the bond?\nThis gave her one minute by herself in the rear, and in that minute she\nsecured the key which would give her future access to the spot where her\ntreasure lay hidden.\n\"The rest of the story I must give you mainly from hearsay. You must\nunderstand by this time what Mr. L'Hommedieu's scheme was in moving\nthus suddenly. He knew that it would be impossible for him, by the most\nminute and continuous watchfulness, to prevent his wife from\nrecovering the bond while they continued to inhabit the rooms in which,\nnotwithstanding his failure to find it, he had reason to believe\nit still lay concealed. But once in other quarters it would be\ncomparatively easy for him to subject her to a surveillance which\nnot only would prevent her from returning to this house without his\nknowledge, but would lead her to give away her secret by the very\nnatural necessity she would be under of going to the exact spot where\nher treasure lay hid.\n\"It was a cunning plot and showed him to be as able as he was\nunscrupulous. How it worked I will now proceed to tell you. It must\nhave been the next afternoon that the janitor came running up to me--I\nsuppose he had learned by this time that I had more than ordinary\ninterest in these people--to say that Mrs. L'Hommedieu had been in the\nhouse and had been so frightened by a man who had followed her that she\nhad fainted dead away on the floor. Would I go down to her?\n\"I had rather have gone anywhere else, unless it was to prison, but duty\ncannot be shirked, and I followed the man down. But we were too late.\nMrs. L'Hommedieu had recovered and gone away, and the person who had\nfrightened her was also gone, and only the hall-boy remained to give any\nexplanations.\n\"This was what he had to say:\n\"'The man it was who went first. As soon as the lady fell he skipped\nout. I don't think he meant no good here--'\n\"'Did she drop here in the hall?' I asked, unable to restrain my intense\nanxiety.\n\"'Oh, no, ma'am! They was in the back room yonder, which she got in\nsomehow. The man followed her in, sneaking and sneaking like an eel or a\ncop, and she fell right against---'\n\"'Don't tell me where!' I cried. 'I don't want to know where!' And I was\nabout to return up-stairs when I heard a quick, sharp voice behind\nme and realized that Mr. L'Hommedieu had come in and was having some\ndispute with the janitor.\n\"Common prudence led me to listen. He wanted, as was very natural, to\nenter the room where his wife had just been surprised, but the janitor,\nalarmed by the foregoing very irregular proceedings, was disposed to\ndeny his right to do so.\n\"'The furniture is held as a surety,' said he, 'and I have orders---'\n\"But Mr. L'Hommedieu had a spare dollar, and before many minutes had\nelapsed I heard him go into that room and close the door. Of the next\nten minutes and the suspense I felt I need not speak. When he came out\nagain, he looked as if the ground would not hold him.\n\"'I have done some mischief, I fear,' he airily said as he passed by\nthe janitor. 'But I'll pay for it. Don't worry. I'll pay for it and the\nrent, too, to-morrow. You may tell Mrs. Latimer so.' And he was gone,\nleaving us all agape in the hallway.\n\"A minute later we all crept to that room and looked in. Now that he\nhad got the money I for one was determined to know where she had hid it.\nThere was no mistaking the spot. A single glance was enough to show us\nthe paper ripped off from a portion of the wall, revealing a narrow gap\nbehind the baseboard large enough to hold the bond. It was near--\"\n\"Wait!\" I put in as I remembered where the so called Mrs. Helmuth\nhad pointed just before she died. \"Wasn't it at the left of the large\nfolding doors and midway to the wall?\"\n\"How came you to know?\" she asked. \"Did Mrs. Latimer tell you?\" But as I\ndid not answer she soon took up the thread of her narrative again, and,\nsighing softly, said:\n\"The next day came and went, but no Mr. L'Hommedieu appeared; another,\nand I began to grow seriously uneasy; a third, and a dreadful thing\nhappened. Late in the afternoon Mrs. L'Hommedieu, dressed very oddly for\nher, came sliding in at the front door, and with an appealing smile at\nthe hall-boy, who wished but dared not ask her for the key which made\nthese visits possible, glided by to her old rooms, and, finding the door\nunlocked, went softly in. Her appearance is worth description, for it\nshows the pitiful efforts she made at disguise, in the hope, I suppose,\nof escaping the surveillance she was evidently conscious of being under.\nShe was in the habit of wearing on cool days a black circular with\na gray lining. This she had turned inside out so that the gray was\nuppermost, while over her neat black bonnet she had flung a long veil,\nalso gray, which not only hid her face, but gave to her appearance\nan eccentric look as different as possible from her usual aspect. The\nhall-boy, who had never seen her save in showy black or bright colors,\nsaid she looked like a ghost in the daytime, but it was all done for\na purpose, I am sure, and to escape the attention of the man who had\nbefore followed her. Alas, he might have followed her this time without\naddition to her suffering! Scarcely had she entered the room where her\ntreasure had been left than she saw the torn paper and gaping baseboard,\nand, uttering a cry so piercing it found its way even to the stolid\nheart of the hall-boy, she tottered back into the hall, where she fell\ninto the arms of her husband, who had followed her in from the street in\na state of frenzy almost equal to her own.\n\"The janitor, who that minute appeared on the stairway, says that he\nnever saw two such faces.

      "summary": "Continuing from the earlier segments, *The Gray Madam* unfolds as a layered detective and psychological tale blending supernatural motifs with a poignant human drama marked by financial despair, addiction, secrecy, and tragic deterioration within a troubled marriage. The narrator’s investigation, originally prompted by an eerie ghostly apparition—the spectral gray lady—gradually uncovers the tragic story of the L’Hommedieu couple, former tenants of the narrator’s residence, whose lives were fraught with conflict and suffering. The death of Mrs. Helmuth, the chilling locked-room mystery of the gray madam apparition, and the discovery of a secret bond all interconnect in a narrative that probes deeply into human frailty behind the spectral façade.\n\nThe narrative’s earlier parts exposed the dim and suffocating world of the L’Hommedieus: Mrs. L’Hommedieu, once elegant and lively, now paralyzed by a debilitating stroke, and Mr. L’Hommedieu, a man undone by gambling and moral decline. Financial ruin threatened them both, with the husband’s reckless losses and the wife’s desperate efforts to preserve a secret bond—a debt owed by an acquaintance named Lafarge that represented their last hope for salvation. The locked room from which the ghost emerged was revealed as a symbolic space, reflecting secrets physically hidden behind walls and psychologically locked away from open confrontation.\n\nThe fourth and final segment unfolds with heightened dramatic intensity. The couple is forced to leave their residence abruptly, with Mr. L’Hommedieu sarcastically correcting the assertion that half their goods were held as surety for rent—they were only allowed to keep some clothes and a bed. Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s composed acceptance contrasts strikingly with her husband’s petulance, underscoring her inner fortitude in the face of destitution and oppression. When Mr. L’Hommedieu drapes her mantle over her shoulders—a gesture with apparent care—her languid reply conveys resignation rather than gratitude or hope. Her silent communication with the narrator, inviting him to accompany her downstairs, subtly signals the delicate alliance between her and the narrator, who functions as impartial observer and potential protector.\n\nAs they descend the stairs, the narrator senses Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s hesitation and, understanding her intent, quickly moves ahead to the front parlor, thereby allowing her a precious minute of solitude. In this brief, critical interval, she retrieves the key to the hidden bond’s secret hiding place, an act that is fraught with silent urgency and the fragile hope of retaining control over their dwindling assets. This moment crystallizes the story’s recurring motif of concealment and revelation—the bond itself is not only monetary security but a symbol of autonomy and resilience under siege.\n\nThe narrator then recounts, largely from hearsay, Mr. L’Hommedieu’s shrewd but ruthless plan following their sudden relocation. Recognizing that constant watchfulness within their old rooms was impossible, Mr. L’Hommedieu intended to move elsewhere where he could better control and surveil his wife, preventing her from reclaiming the bond or revisiting its hiding place undetected. His strategy relied on isolation and psychological control, effectively imprisoning Mrs. L’Hommedieu even after physically removing her from their former home.\n\nShortly thereafter, alarming news arrives: Mrs. L’Hommedieu had returned secretly to the old house and, upon being frightened by a man who followed her, collapsed and fainted. The narrator, obliged by duty, rushes to assist but finds her recovered and departed, with only a hall-boy to recount the scene. From the hall-boy’s account, the narrator learns the man’s pursuit was surreptitious and menacing, likened to a cop or eel. The scene of the collapse was in the back room—an area significant to the locked-room mystery and the final resting place of the bond. This incident ominously highlights the constant tension and threats Mrs. L’Hommedieu faces, trapped between fear, illness, and her husband’s oppressive grasp.\n\nMr. L’Hommedieu attempts to enter the room where his wife was discovered but encounters resistance from the janitor, who recalls orders restricting access since the furniture remained under landlord’s lien for unpaid rent. The husband manages, with a bribe, to get in and spends ten suspenseful minutes inside. He emerges disheveled and defeated, admitting to “some mischief” but promising to pay the rent and any damages. Upon inspection, the narrator and others find the hiding place where the bond had been concealed: a portion of the wall’s paper torn away, exposing a narrow gap behind the baseboard near the large folding doors, exactly where Mrs. Helmuth had pointed before her death.\n\nThis discovery leads to the story’s heartbreaking climax. Days pass without Mr. L’Hommedieu’s return, increasing the anxieties surrounding the bond’s fate. Then, Mrs. L’Hommedieu appears unexpectedly at the old house, disguised in a deliberately eccentric manner: a black circular coat turned inside out to show its gray lining, a long gray veil covering her face. This ghostlike daytime apparition—a “gray madam” in all but name—is a deliberate attempt to elude her husband’s watchful presence and retrieve her hidden treasure.\n\nHowever, her hopes are dashed. Upon entering the room, she immediately notices the torn paper and the exposed cavity, now empty. Her piercing cry reverberates even to the hall-boy’s “stolid heart.” In the hallway, she is confronted by her husband, who has followed her in a near-frenzy. They share a despairing, wordless moment, before she tells him that the bond is gone—that he has taken it and put their future in jeopardy. His groan and cryptic remark about “luck” and “the devil in the cards” reveal his gambler’s fatalistic mindset even as his wife curses him bitterly—her “curse” falling upon him as a symbol of the wreckage his addiction has wrought upon their lives.\n\nThe couple’s emotional and physical collapse culminates in Mr. L’Hommedieu’s sudden flight from their shared life—the last the narrator and his acquaintances see of him. Mrs. L’Hommedieu, shattered, suffers a paralytic stroke that robs her of her faculties. She is taken to a hospital where the narrator visits her, only to find that either grief, illness, or both have erased her recognition of her former friends. Mrs. Latimer, the apartment’s responsible party, sells the furniture and uses part of the proceeds to assist Mrs. L’Hommedieu with some modest resources for a new start, though her fate beyond this point is unknown.\n\nThis final segment provides a tragic resolution to the human story entwined with the spectral mystery. The gray madam’s haunting appearance is no longer simply an eerie phenomenon but instead a symbolic manifestation of Mrs. L’Hommedieu’s desperate attempts to preserve dignity and hope amid ruinous circumstances. The bond—once a practical financial instrument—becomes emblematic of the fragile hold she kept over her own life and survival. The husband’s duplicity, his gambling-induced moral descent, and ultimate abandonment destroy that last chance, leaving the wife physically incapacitated and emotionally desolate.\n\nThe narrative’s supernatural elements—ghostly visitations, locked doors, and hidden keys—intersect seamlessly with the psychological reality of financial desperation, mistrust, and human frailty. The “gray madam” is less a revenant than a living testament to the destructive power of secrets, addiction, and broken relationships. The locked-room mystery is resolved not by sensational sleight of hand or criminal machinations, but by unveiling the human motives and tragedies concealed behind locked doors and spectral illusions.\n\nThrough the narrator’s steady, impartial observation and his piecing together of stories and clues—from Mrs. Helmuth’s death to the L’Hommedieus’ downfall—the story ultimately portrays a haunting social drama. It explores the intersection of supernatural suggestion and stark human suffering, illustrating how spectral phenomena can emerge from the unresolved sorrows binding the living.\n\nIn sum, *The Gray Madam* ends with a somber portrayal of loss and defeat, the collapse of hope personified in a woman’s disability and madness, and a gambler’s ruin culminating in abandonment. The narrator’s journey from curiosity to sympathy exposes the gray lady’s tragic essence: a symbol not just of ghostly mystery but of the human cost of desperation, secrets, and shattered promises. The story’s lasting impression is one of eerie pathos—a haunting reminder that the most chilling ghosts may be those born of human weakness and sorrow, forever haunting the locked rooms of memory and the shadows of past lives."

The bond—once a practical financial instrument—becomes emblematic of the fragile hold she kept over her own life and survival. The husband’s duplicity, his gambling-induced moral descent, and ultimate abandonment destroy that last chance, leaving the wife physically incapacitated and emotionally desolate.\n\nThe narrative’s supernatural elements—ghostly visitations, locked doors, and hidden keys—intersect seamlessly with the psychological reality of financial desperation, mistrust, and human frailty. The “gray madam” is less a revenant than a living testament to the destructive power of secrets, addiction, and broken relationships. The locked-room mystery is resolved not by sensational sleight of hand or criminal machinations, but by unveiling the human motives and tragedies concealed behind locked doors and spectral illusions.\n\nThrough the narrator’s steady, impartial observation and his piecing together of stories and clues—from Mrs. Helmuth’s death to the L’Hommedieus’ downfall—the story ultimately portrays a haunting social drama. It explores the intersection of supernatural suggestion and stark human suffering, illustrating how spectral phenomena can emerge from the unresolved sorrows binding the living.\n\nIn sum, *The Gray Madam* ends with a somber portrayal of loss and defeat, the collapse of hope personified in a woman’s disability and madness, and a gambler’s ruin culminating in abandonment. The narrator’s journey from curiosity to sympathy exposes the gray lady’s tragic essence: a symbol not just of ghostly mystery but of the human cost of desperation, secrets, and shattered promises. The story’s lasting impression is one of eerie pathos—a haunting reminder that the most chilling ghosts may be those born of human weakness and sorrow, forever haunting the locked rooms of memory and the shadows of past lives.",
