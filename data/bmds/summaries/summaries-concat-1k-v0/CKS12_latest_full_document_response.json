    "text": "IT was what, in college, we used to call \"good football weather\"—a crisp, autumn afternoon that sent the blood tingling through brain and muscle. Kennedy and I were enjoying a stroll on the drive, dividing our attention between the glowing red sunset across the Hudson and the string of homeward-bound automobiles on the broad parkway. Suddenly a huge black touring car marked with big letters, \"P.D.N.Y.,\" shot past.\n\"Joy-riding again in one of the city's cars,\" I remarked. \"I thought the last Police Department shake-up had put a stop to that.\"\n\"Perhaps it has,\" returned Kennedy. \"Did you see who was in the car?\"\n\"No, but I see it has turned and is coming back.\"\n\"It was Inspector—I mean, First Deputy O'Connor. I thought he recognised us as he whizzed along, and I guess he did, too. Ah, congratulations, O'Connor! I haven't had a chance to tell you before how pleased I was to learn you had been appointed first deputy. It ought to have been commissioner, though,\" added Kennedy.\n\"Congratulations nothing,\" rejoined O'Connor. \"Just another new- deal-election coming on, mayor must make a show of getting some reform done, and all that sort of thing. So he began with the Police Department, and here I am, first deputy. But, say, Kennedy,\" he added, dropping his voice, \"I've a little job on my mind that I'd like to pull off in about as spectacular a fashion as I—as you know how. I want to make good, conspicuously good, at the start—understand? Maybe I'll be 'broke' for it and sent to pounding the pavements of Dismissalville, but I don't care, I'll take a chance. On the level, Kennedy, it's a big thing, and it ought to be done. Will you help me put it across?\"\n\"What is it?\" asked Kennedy with a twinkle in his eye at O'Connor's estimate of the security of his tenure of office.\nO'Connor drew us away from the automobile toward the stone parapet overlooking the railroad and river far below, and out of earshot of the department chauffeur. \"I want to pull off a successful raid on the Vesper Club,\" he whispered earnestly, scanning our faces.\n\"Good heavens, man,\" I ejaculated, \"don't you know that Senator Danfield is interested in—\"\n\"Jameson,\" interrupted O'Connor reproachfully, \"I said 'on the level' a few moments ago, and I meant it. Senator Danfield he—well, anyhow, if I don't do it the district attorney will, with the aid of the Dowling law, and I am going to beat him to it, that's all. There's too much money being lost at the Vesper Club, anyhow. It won't hurt Danfield to be taught a lesson not to run such a phony game. I may like to put up a quiet bet myself on the ponies now and then—I won't say I don't, but this thing of Danfield's has got beyond all reason. It's the crookedest gambling joint in the city, at least judging by the stories they tell of losses there. And so beastly aristocratic, too. Read that.\"\nO'Connor shoved a letter into Kennedy's hand, a dainty perfumed and monogrammed little missive addressed in a feminine hand. It was such a letter as comes by the thousand to the police in the course of a year; though seldom from ladies of the smart set.\nDear Sir:\nI notice in the newspapers this morning that you have just been appointed first deputy commissioner of police and that you have been ordered to suppress gambling in New York. For the love that you must still bear toward your own mother, listen to the story of a mother worn with anxiety for her only son, and if there is any justice or righteousness in this great city close up a gambling hell that is sending to ruin scores of our finest young men. No doubt you know or have heard of my family—the DeLongs are not unknown in New York. Perhaps you have also heard of the losses of my son Percival at the Vesper Club. They are fast becoming the common talk of our set. I am not rich, Mr. Commissioner, in spite of our social position, but I am human, as human as a mother in any station of life, and oh, if there is any way, close up that gilded society resort that is dissipating our small fortune, ruining an only son, and slowly bringing to the grave a gray-haired widow, as worthy of protection as any mother of the poor whose plea has closed up a little poolroom or low policy shop.\"\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Julia M. DeLong.\nP.S.—Please keep this confidential—at least from my son Percival.\nJ. M. DeL.\n\"Well,\" said Kennedy, as he handed back the letter, \"O'Connor, if you do it, I'll take back all the hard things I've ever said about the police system. Young DeLong was in one of my classes at the university, until he was expelled for that last mad prank of his. There's more to that boy than most people think, but he's the wildest scion of wealth I have ever come in contact with. How are you going to pull off your raid—is it to be down through the skylight or up from the cellar?\"\n\"Kennedy,\" replied O'Connor in the same reproachful tone with which he had addressed me, \"talk sense. I'm in earnest. You know the Vesper Club is barred and barricaded like the National City Bank. It isn't one of those common gambling joints which depend for protection on what we call 'ice-box doors.' It's proof against all the old methods. Axes and sledge-hammers would make no impression there.\"\n\"Your predecessor had some success at opening doors with a hydraulic jack, I believe, in some very difficult raids,\" put in Kennedy.\n\"A hydraulic jack wouldn't do for the Vesper Club, I'm afraid,\" remarked O'Connor wearily. \"Why, sir, that place has been proved bomb-proof—bomb-proof, sir. You remember recently the so- called 'gamblers' war' in which some rivals exploded a bomb on the steps? It did more damage to the house next door than to the club. However, I can get past the outer door, I think, even if it is strong. But inside—you must have heard of it—is the famous steel door, three inches thick, made of armourplate. It's no use to try it at all unless we can pass that door with reasonable quickness. All the evidence we shall get will be of an innocent social club-room downstairs. The gambling is all on the second floor, beyond this door, in a room without a window in it. Surely you've heard of that famous gambling-room, with its perfect system of artificial ventilation and electric lighting that makes it rival noonday at midnight. And don't tell me I've got to get on the other side of the door by strategy, either. It is strategy-proof. The system of lookouts is perfect. No, force is necessary, but it must not be destructive of life or property—or, by heaven, I'd drive up there and riddle the place with a fourteen-inch gun,\" exclaimed O'Connor.\n\"H'm!\" mused Kennedy as he flicked the ashes off his cigar and meditatively watched a passing freight-train on the railroad below us. \"There goes a car loaded with tons and tons of scrap iron. You want me to scrap that three-inch steel door, do you?\"\n\"Kennedy, I'll buy that particular scrap from you at almost its weight in gold. The fact is, I have a secret fund at my disposal such as former commissioners have asked for in vain. I can afford to pay you well, as well as any private client, and I hear you have had some good fees lately. Only deliver the goods.\"\n\"No,\" answered Kennedy, rather piqued, \"it isn't money that I am after. I merely wanted to be sure that you are in earnest. I can get you past that door as if it were made of green baize.\"\nIt was O'Connor's turn to look incredulous, but as Kennedy apparently meant exactly what he said, he simply asked, \"And will you?\"\n\"I will do it to-night if you say so,\" replied Kennedy quietly. \"Are you ready?\"\nFor answer O'Connor simply grasped Craig's hand, as if to seal the compact.\n\"All right, then,\" continued Kennedy. \"Send a furniture-van, one of those closed vans that the storage warehouses use, up to my laboratory any time before seven o'clock. How many men will you need in the raid? Twelve? Will a van hold that many comfortably? I'll want to put some apparatus in it, but that won't take much room.\"\n\"Why, yes, I think so,\" answered O'Connor. \"I'll get a well- padded van so that they won't be badly jolted by the ride down- town. By George! Kennedy, I see you know more of that side of police strategy than I gave you credit for.\"\n\"Then have the men drop into my laboratory singly about the same time. You can arrange that so that it will not look suspicious, so far uptown. It will be dark, anyhow. Perhaps, O'Connor, you can make up as the driver yourself—anyhow, get one you can trust absolutely. Then have the van down near the corner of Broadway below the club, driving slowly along about the time the theatre crowd is out. Leave the rest to me. I will give you or the driver orders when the time comes.\"\nAs O'Connor thanked Craig, he remarked without a shade of insincerity, \"Kennedy, talk about being commissioner, you ought to be commissioner.\"\n\"Wait till I deliver the goods,\" answered Craig simply. \"I may fall down and bring you nothing but a lawsuit for damages for unlawful entry or unjust persecution, or whatever they call it.\"\n\"I'll take a chance at that,\" called back O'Connor as he jumped into his car and directed, \"Headquarters, quick.\"\nAS the car disappeared, Kennedy filled his lungs with air as if reluctant to leave the drive. \"Our constitutional,\" he remarked, \"is abruptly at an end, Walter.\"\nThen he laughed, as he looked about him.\n\"What a place in which to plot a raid on Danfield's Vesper Club! Why, the nurse-maids have hardly got the children all in for supper and bed. It's incongruous. Well, I must go over to the laboratory and get some things ready to put in that van with the men. Meet me about half-past seven, Walter, up in the room, all togged up. We'll dine at the Cafe Riviera to-night in style. And, by the way, you're quite a man about town—you must know someone who can introduce us into the Vesper Club.\"\n\"But, Craig,\" I demurred, \"if there is any rough work as a result, it might queer me with them. They might object to being used—\"\n\"Oh, that will be all right. I just want to look the place over and lose a few chips in a good cause. No, it won't queer any of your Star connections. We'll be on the outside when the time comes for anything to happen. In fact I shouldn't wonder if your story would make you all the more solid with the sports. I take all the responsibility; you can have the glory. You know they like to hear the inside gossip of such things, after the event. Try it. Remember, at seven-thirty. We'll be a little late at dinner, but never mind; it will be early enough for the club.\"\nLEFT to my own devices I determined to do a little detective work on my own account, and not only did I succeed in finding an acquaintance who agreed to introduce us at the Vesper Club that night about nine o'clock, but I also learned that Percival DeLong was certain to be there that night, too. I was necessarily vague about Kennedy, for fear my friend might have heard of some of his exploits, but fortunately he did not prove inquisitive.\nI hurried back to our apartment and was in the process of transforming myself into a full-fledged boulevardier, when Kennedy arrived in an extremely cheerful frame of mind. So far, his preparations had progressed very favourably, I guessed, and I was quite elated when he complimented me on what I had accomplished in the meantime.\n\"Pretty tough for the fellows who are condemned to ride around in that van for four mortal hours, though,\" he said as he hurried into his evening clothes, \"but they won't be riding all the time. The driver will make frequent stops.\"\nI was so busy that I paid little attention to him until he had nearly completed his toilet. I gave a gasp.\n\"Why, whatever are you doing?\" I exclaimed as I glanced into his room.\nThere stood Kennedy arrayed in all the glory of a sharp-pointed moustache and a goatee. He had put on evening clothes of decidedly Parisian cut, clothes which he had used abroad and had brought back with him, but which I had never known him to wear since he came back. On a chair reposed a chimney-pot hat that would have been pronounced faultless on the \"continong,\" but was unknown, except among impresarios, on Broadway.\nKennedy shrugged his shoulders—he even had the shrug.\n\"Figure to yourself, monsieur,\" he said. \"Ze great Kennedy, ze detectif Americain—to put it tersely in our own vernacular, wouldn't it be a fool thing for me to appear at the Vesper Club where I should surely be recognised by someone if I went in my ordinary clothes and features? Un faux pas, at the start? Jamais!\"\nThere was nothing to do but agree, and I was glad that I had been discreetly reticent about my companion in talking with the friend who was to gain us entrance to the Avernus beyond the steel door.\nWE met my friend at the Riviera and dined sumptuously. Fortunately he seemed decidedly impressed with my friend Monsieur Kay—I could do no better on the spur of the moment than take Kennedy's initial, which seemed to serve. We progressed amicably from oysters and soup down to coffee, cigars, and liqueurs, and I succeeded in swallowing Kennedy's tales of Monte Carlo and Ostend and Ascot without even a smile. He must have heard them somewhere, and treasured them up for just such an occasion, but he told them in a manner that was verisimilitude itself, using perfect English with just the trace of an accent at the right places.\nAt last it was time to saunter around to the Vesper Club without seeming to be too indecently early. The theatres were not yet out, but my friend said play was just beginning at the club and would soon be in full swing.\nI had a keen sense of wickedness as we mounted the steps in the yellow flare of the flaming arc-light on the Broadway corner not far below us. A heavy, grated door swung open at the practised signal of my friend, and an obsequious negro servant stood bowing and pronouncing his name in the sombre mahogany portal beyond, with its green marble pillars and handsome decorations. A short parley followed, after which we entered, my friend having apparently satisfied someone that we were all right.\nWe did not stop to examine the first floor, which doubtless was innocent enough, but turned quickly up a flight of steps. At the foot of the broad staircase Kennedy paused to examine some rich carvings, and I felt him nudge me. I turned. It was an enclosed staircase, with walls that looked to be of re-enforced concrete. Swung back on hinges concealed like those of a modern burglar- proof safe was the famous steel door.\nWe did not wish to appear to be too interested, yet a certain amount of curiosity was only proper.\nMy friend paused on the steps, turned, and came back.\n\"You're perfectly safe,\" he smiled, tapping the door with his cane with a sort of affectionate respect. \"It would take the police ages to get past that barrier, which would be swung shut and bolted the moment the lookout gave the alarm. But there has never been any trouble. The police know that it is so far, no farther. Besides,\" he added with a wink to me, \"you know, Senator Danfield wouldn't like this pretty little door even scratched. Come up, I think I hear DeLong's voice up-stairs. You've heard of him, monsieur? It's said his luck has changed I'm anxious to find out.\"\nQuickly he led the way up the handsome staircase and into a large, lofty, richly furnished room. Everywhere there were thick, heavy carpets on the floors, into which your feet sank with an air of satisfying luxury.\nTHE room into which we entered was indeed absolutely windowless. It was a room built within the original room of the old house. Thus the windows overlooking the street from the second floor in reality bore no relation to it. For light it depended on a complete oval of lights overhead so arranged as to be themselves invisible, but shining through richly stained glass and conveying the illusion of a slightly clouded noonday. The absence of windows was made up for, as I learned later, by a ventilating device so perfect that, although everyone was smoking, a most fastidious person could scarcely have been offended by the odour of tobacco.\nOf course I did not notice all this at first. What I did notice, however, was a faro-layout and a hazard-board, but as no one was playing at either, my eye quickly travelled to a roulette-table which stretched along the middle of the room. Some ten or a dozen men in evening clothes were gathered watching with intent faces the spinning wheel. There was no money on the table, nothing but piles of chips of various denominations. Another thing that surprised me as I looked was that the tense look on the faces of the players was anything but the feverish, haggard gaze I had expected. In fact, they were sleek, well-fed, typical prosperous New-Yorkers rather inclined to the noticeable in dress and carrying their avoirdupois as if life was an easy game with them. Most of them evidently belonged to the financial and society classes. There were no tragedies; the tragedies were elsewhere—in their offices, homes, in the courts, anywhere, but not here at the club. Here all was life, light, and laughter.\nFor the benefit of those not acquainted with the roulette- wheel—and I may as well confess that most of my own knowledge was gained in that one crowded evening—I may say that it consists, briefly, of a wooden disc very nicely balanced and turning in the centre of a cavity set into a table like a circular wash-basin, with an outer rim turned slightly inward. The \"croupier\" revolves the wheel to the right. With a quick motion of his middle finger he flicks a marble, usually of ivory, to the left. At the Vesper Club, always up-to-date, the ball was of platinum, not of ivory. The disc with its sloping sides is provided with a number of brass rods, some perpendicular, some horizontal. As the ball and the wheel lose momentum the ball strikes against the rods and finally is deflected into one of the many little pockets or stalls facing the rim of the wheel.\nThere are thirty-eight of these pockets; two are marked \"0\" and \"00,\" the others numbered from one to thirty-six in an irregular and confusing order and painted alternately red and black. At each end of the table are thirty-six large squares correspondingly numbered and coloured. The \"0\" and \"00\" are of a neutral colour. Whenever the ball falls in the \"0\" or \"00\" the bank takes the stakes, or sweeps the the board. The Monte Carlo wheel has only one \"0,\" while the typical American has two, and the Chinese has four.\nTo one like myself who had read of the Continental gambling- houses with the clink of gold pieces on the table, and the croupier with his wooden rake noisily raking in the winnings of the bank, the comparative silence of the American game comes as a surprise.\nAs we advanced, we heard only the rattle of the ball, the click of the chips, and the monotonous tone of the spinner: \"Twenty- three, black. Eight, red. Seventeen, black.\" It was almost like the boys in a broker's office calling off the quotations of the ticker and marking them up on the board.\nLeaning forward, almost oblivious to the rest, was Percival DeLong, a tall, lithe, handsome young man, whose boyish face ill comported with the marks of dissipation clearly outlined on it. Such a boy, it flashed across my mind, ought to be studying the possible plays of football of an evening in the field-house after his dinner at the training-table, rather than the possible gyrations of the little platinum ball on the wheel.\n\"Curse the luck!\" he exclaimed, as \"17\" appeared again.\nA Hebrew banker staked a pile of chips on the \"17\" to come up a third time. A murmur of applause at his nerve ran through the circle. DeLong hesitated, as one who thought, \"Seventeen has come out twice—the odds against its coming again are too great, even though the winnings would be fabulous, for a good stake.\" He placed his next bet on another number.\n\"He's playing Lord Rosslyn's system, to-night,\" whispered my friend.\nThe wheel spun, the ball rolled, and the croupier called again, \"Seventeen, black.\" A tremor of excitement ran through the crowd. It was almost unprecedented.\nDeLong, with a stifled oath, leaned back and scanned the faces about the table.\n\"And '17' has precisely the same chance of turning up in the next spin as if it had not already had a run of three,\" said a voice at my elbow.\nIt was Kennedy. The roulette-table needs no introduction when curious sequences are afoot. All are friends.\n\"That's the theory of Sir Hiram Maxim;\" commented my friend, as he excused himself reluctantly for another appointment. \"But no true gambler will believe it, monsieur, or at least act on it.\"\nAll eyes were turned on Kennedy, who made a gesture of polite deprecation, as if the remark of my friend were true, but he nonchalantly placed his chips on the \"17.\"\n\"The odds against '17' appearing four consecutive times are some millions,\" he went on, \"and yet, having appeared three times, it is just as likely to appear again as before. It is the usual practice to avoid a number that has had a run, on the theory that some other number is more likely to come up than it is. That would be the case if it were drawing balls from a bag full of red and black balls—the more red ones drawn the smaller the chance of drawing another red one. But if the balls are put back in the bag after being drawn the chances of drawing a red one after three have been drawn are exactly the same as ever. If we toss a cent and heads appear twelve times, that does not have the slightest effect on the thirteenth toss—there is still an even chance that it, too, will be heads. So if '17' had come up five times to-night, it would be just as likely to come the sixth as if the previous five had not occurred, and that despite the fact that before it has appeared at all odds against a run of the same number six times in succession are about two billion, four hundred and ninety-six million, and some thousands. Most systems are based on the old persistent belief that occurrences of chance are affected in some way by occurrences immediately preceding, but disconnected physically. If we've had a run of black for twenty times, system says play the red for the twenty-first. But black is just as likely to turn up the twenty-first as if it were the first play of all. The confusion arises because a run of twenty on the black should happen once in one million, forty- eight thousand, five hundred and seventy-six coups. It would take ten years to make that many coups, and the run of twenty might occur once or any number of times in it. It is only when one deals with infinitely large numbers of coups that one can count on infinitely small variations in the mathematical results. This game does not go on for infinity—therefore anything, everything, may happen. Systems are based on the infinite; we play in the finite.\"\n\"You talk like a professor I had at the university,\" ejaculated DeLong contemptuously as Craig finished his disquisition on the practical fallibility of theoretically infallible systems. Again DeLong carefully avoided the \"17,\" as well as the black.\nThe wheel spun again; the ball rolled. The knot of spectators around the table watched with bated breath.\nSeventeen won!\nAs Kennedy piled up his winnings superciliously, without even the appearance of triumph, a man behind me whispered, \"A foreign nobleman with a system—watch him.\"\n\"Non, monsieur,\" said Kennedy quickly, having overheard the remark, \"no system, sir. There is only one system of which I know.\"\n\"What?\" asked DeLong eagerly.\nKennedy staked a large sum on the red to win. The black came up, and he lost. He doubled the stake and played again, and again lost. With amazing calmness Craig kept right on doubling.\n\"The martingale,\" I heard the man whisper behind me. \"In other words, double or quit.\"\nKennedy was now in for some hundreds, a sum that was sufficiently large for him, but he doubled again, still cheerfully playing the red, and the red won. As he gathered up his chips he rose.\n\"That's the only system,\" he said simply.\n\"But, go on, go on,\" came the chorus from about the table.\n\"No,\" said Kennedy quietly, \"that is part of the system, too—to quit when you have won back your stakes and a little more.\"\n\"Huh!\" exclaimed DeLong in disgust. \"Suppose you were in for some thousands—you wouldn't quit. If you had real sporting blood you wouldn't quit, anyhow!\"\nKennedy calmly passed over the open insult, letting it be understood that he ignored this beardless youth.\n\"There is no way you can beat the game in the long run if you keep at it,\" he answered simply. \"It is mathematically impossible. Consider. We are Croesuses—we hire players to stake money for us on every possible number at every coup. How do we come out? If there are no '0' or '00,' we come out after each coup precisely where we started—we are paying our own money back and forth among ourselves; we have neither more nor less. But with the '0' and '00' the bank sweeps the board every so often. It is only a question of time when, after paying our money back and forth among ourselves, it has all filtered through the '0' and '00' into the bank. It is not a game of chance for the bank—ah, it is exact, mathematical—c'est une question d' arithmetique, seulement, nest-ce pas, messieurs?\"\n\"Perhaps,\" admitted DeLong, \"but it doesn't explain why I am losing to-night while everyone else is winning.\"\n\"We are not winning,\" persisted Craig. \"After I have had a bite to eat I will demonstrate how to lose—by keeping on playing.\" He led the way to the cafe.\nDeLong was too intent on the game to leave, even for refreshments. Now and then I saw him beckon to an attendant, who brought him a stiff drink of whiskey. For a moment his play seemed a little better, then he would drop back into his hopeless losing. For some reason or other his \"system\" failed absolutely.\n\"You see, he is hopeless,\" mused Kennedy over our light repast. \"And yet of all gambling games roulette offers the player the best odds, far better than horse-racing, for instance. Our method has usually been to outlaw roulette and permit horse racing; in other words, suppress the more favourable and permit the less favourable. However, we're doing better now; we're suppressing both. Of course what I say applies only to roulette when it is honestly played—DeLong would lose anyhow, I fear.\"\nI started at Kennedy's tone and whispered hastily: \"What do you mean? Do you think the wheel is crooked?\"\n\"I haven't a doubt of it,\" he replied in an undertone. \"That run of '17' might happen—yes. But it is improbable. They let me win because I was a new player—new players always win at first. It is proverbial, but the man who is running this game has made it look like a platitude. To satisfy myself on that point I am going to play again—until I have lost my winnings and am just square with the game. When I reach the point that I am convinced that some crooked work is going on I am going to try a little experiment, Walter. I want you to stand close to me so that no one can see what I am doing. Do just as I will indicate to you.\"\nTHE gambling-room was now fast filling up with the first of the theatre crowd. DeLong's table was the centre of attraction, owing to the high play. A group of young men of his set were commiserating with him on his luck and discussing it with the finished air of roues of double their ages. He was doggedly following his system.\nKennedy and I approached.\n\"Ah, here is the philosophical stranger again;\" DeLong exclaimed, catching sight of Kennedy. \"Perhaps he can enlighten us on how to win at roulette by playing his own system.\"\n\"Au contrarie, monsieur, let me demonstrate how to lose,\" answered Craig with a smile that showed a row of faultless teeth beneath his black moustache, decidedly foreign.\nKennedy played and lost, and lost again; then he won, but in the main he lost. After one particularly large loss I felt his arm on mine, drawing me closely to him. DeLong had taken a sort of grim pleasure in the fact that Kennedy, too, was losing. I found that Craig had paused in his play at a moment when DeLong had staked a large sum that a number below \"18\" would turn up—for five plays the numbers had been between \"18\" and \"36.\" Curious to see what Craig was doing, I looked cautiously down between us. All eyes were fixed on the wheel. ",
    "prompt": "Summarize the following document for Detective story 'The Steel Door' by Unknown. Ensure that the summary is between 600 and 900 words long.\n\nDocument:\nIT was what, in college, we used to call \"good football weather\"—a crisp, autumn afternoon that sent the blood tingling through brain and muscle. Kennedy and I were enjoying a stroll on the drive, dividing our attention between the glowing red sunset across the Hudson and the string of homeward-bound automobiles on the broad parkway. Suddenly a huge black touring car marked with big letters, \"P.D.N.Y.,\" shot past.\n\"Joy-riding again in one of the city's cars,\" I remarked. \"I thought the last Police Department shake-up had put a stop to that.\"\n\"Perhaps it has,\" returned Kennedy. \"Did you see who was in the car?\"\n\"No, but I see it has turned and is coming back.\"\n\"It was Inspector—I mean, First Deputy O'Connor. I thought he recognised us as he whizzed along, and I guess he did, too. Ah, congratulations, O'Connor! I haven't had a chance to tell you before how pleased I was to learn you had been appointed first deputy. It ought to have been commissioner, though,\" added Kennedy.\n\"Congratulations nothing,\" rejoined O'Connor. \"Just another new- deal-election coming on, mayor must make a show of getting some reform done, and all that sort of thing. So he began with the Police Department, and here I am, first deputy. But, say, Kennedy,\" he added, dropping his voice, \"I've a little job on my mind that I'd like to pull off in about as spectacular a fashion as I—as you know how. I want to make good, conspicuously good, at the start—understand? Maybe I'll be 'broke' for it and sent to pounding the pavements of Dismissalville, but I don't care, I'll take a chance. On the level, Kennedy, it's a big thing, and it ought to be done. Will you help me put it across?\"\n\"What is it?\" asked Kennedy with a twinkle in his eye at O'Connor's estimate of the security of his tenure of office.\nO'Connor drew us away from the automobile toward the stone parapet overlooking the railroad and river far below, and out of earshot of the department chauffeur. \"I want to pull off a successful raid on the Vesper Club,\" he whispered earnestly, scanning our faces.\n\"Good heavens, man,\" I ejaculated, \"don't you know that Senator Danfield is interested in—\"\n\"Jameson,\" interrupted O'Connor reproachfully, \"I said 'on the level' a few moments ago, and I meant it. Senator Danfield he—well, anyhow, if I don't do it the district attorney will, with the aid of the Dowling law, and I am going to beat him to it, that's all. There's too much money being lost at the Vesper Club, anyhow. It won't hurt Danfield to be taught a lesson not to run such a phony game. I may like to put up a quiet bet myself on the ponies now and then—I won't say I don't, but this thing of Danfield's has got beyond all reason. It's the crookedest gambling joint in the city, at least judging by the stories they tell of losses there. And so beastly aristocratic, too. Read that.\"\nO'Connor shoved a letter into Kennedy's hand, a dainty perfumed and monogrammed little missive addressed in a feminine hand. It was such a letter as comes by the thousand to the police in the course of a year; though seldom from ladies of the smart set.\nDear Sir:\nI notice in the newspapers this morning that you have just been appointed first deputy commissioner of police and that you have been ordered to suppress gambling in New York. For the love that you must still bear toward your own mother, listen to the story of a mother worn with anxiety for her only son, and if there is any justice or righteousness in this great city close up a gambling hell that is sending to ruin scores of our finest young men. No doubt you know or have heard of my family—the DeLongs are not unknown in New York. Perhaps you have also heard of the losses of my son Percival at the Vesper Club. They are fast becoming the common talk of our set. I am not rich, Mr. Commissioner, in spite of our social position, but I am human, as human as a mother in any station of life, and oh, if there is any way, close up that gilded society resort that is dissipating our small fortune, ruining an only son, and slowly bringing to the grave a gray-haired widow, as worthy of protection as any mother of the poor whose plea has closed up a little poolroom or low policy shop.\"\nSincerely,\n(Mrs.) Julia M. DeLong.\nP.S.—Please keep this confidential—at least from my son Percival.\nJ. M. DeL.\n\"Well,\" said Kennedy, as he handed back the letter, \"O'Connor, if you do it, I'll take back all the hard things I've ever said about the police system. Young DeLong was in one of my classes at the university, until he was expelled for that last mad prank of his. There's more to that boy than most people think, but he's the wildest scion of wealth I have ever come in contact with. How are you going to pull off your raid—is it to be down through the skylight or up from the cellar?\"\n\"Kennedy,\" replied O'Connor in the same reproachful tone with which he had addressed me, \"talk sense. I'm in earnest. You know the Vesper Club is barred and barricaded like the National City Bank. It isn't one of those common gambling joints which depend for protection on what we call 'ice-box doors.' It's proof against all the old methods. Axes and sledge-hammers would make no impression there.\"\n\"Your predecessor had some success at opening doors with a hydraulic jack, I believe, in some very difficult raids,\" put in Kennedy.\n\"A hydraulic jack wouldn't do for the Vesper Club, I'm afraid,\" remarked O'Connor wearily. \"Why, sir, that place has been proved bomb-proof—bomb-proof, sir. You remember recently the so- called 'gamblers' war' in which some rivals exploded a bomb on the steps? It did more damage to the house next door than to the club. However, I can get past the outer door, I think, even if it is strong. But inside—you must have heard of it—is the famous steel door, three inches thick, made of armourplate. It's no use to try it at all unless we can pass that door with reasonable quickness. All the evidence we shall get will be of an innocent social club-room downstairs. The gambling is all on the second floor, beyond this door, in a room without a window in it. Surely you've heard of that famous gambling-room, with its perfect system of artificial ventilation and electric lighting that makes it rival noonday at midnight. And don't tell me I've got to get on the other side of the door by strategy, either. It is strategy-proof. The system of lookouts is perfect. No, force is necessary, but it must not be destructive of life or property—or, by heaven, I'd drive up there and riddle the place with a fourteen-inch gun,\" exclaimed O'Connor.\n\"H'm!\" mused Kennedy as he flicked the ashes off his cigar and meditatively watched a passing freight-train on the railroad below us. \"There goes a car loaded with tons and tons of scrap iron. You want me to scrap that three-inch steel door, do you?\"\n\"Kennedy, I'll buy that particular scrap from you at almost its weight in gold. The fact is, I have a secret fund at my disposal such as former commissioners have asked for in vain. I can afford to pay you well, as well as any private client, and I hear you have had some good fees lately. Only deliver the goods.\"\n\"No,\" answered Kennedy, rather piqued, \"it isn't money that I am after. I merely wanted to be sure that you are in earnest. I can get you past that door as if it were made of green baize.\"\nIt was O'Connor's turn to look incredulous, but as Kennedy apparently meant exactly what he said, he simply asked, \"And will you?\"\n\"I will do it to-night if you say so,\" replied Kennedy quietly. \"Are you ready?\"\nFor answer O'Connor simply grasped Craig's hand, as if to seal the compact.\n\"All right, then,\" continued Kennedy. \"Send a furniture-van, one of those closed vans that the storage warehouses use, up to my laboratory any time before seven o'clock. How many men will you need in the raid? Twelve? Will a van hold that many comfortably? I'll want to put some apparatus in it, but that won't take much room.\"\n\"Why, yes, I think so,\" answered O'Connor. \"I'll get a well- padded van so that they won't be badly jolted by the ride down- town. By George! Kennedy, I see you know more of that side of police strategy than I gave you credit for.\"\n\"Then have the men drop into my laboratory singly about the same time. You can arrange that so that it will not look suspicious, so far uptown. It will be dark, anyhow. Perhaps, O'Connor, you can make up as the driver yourself—anyhow, get one you can trust absolutely. Then have the van down near the corner of Broadway below the club, driving slowly along about the time the theatre crowd is out. Leave the rest to me. I will give you or the driver orders when the time comes.\"\nAs O'Connor thanked Craig, he remarked without a shade of insincerity, \"Kennedy, talk about being commissioner, you ought to be commissioner.\"\n\"Wait till I deliver the goods,\" answered Craig simply. \"I may fall down and bring you nothing but a lawsuit for damages for unlawful entry or unjust persecution, or whatever they call it.\"\n\"I'll take a chance at that,\" called back O'Connor as he jumped into his car and directed, \"Headquarters, quick.\"\nAS the car disappeared, Kennedy filled his lungs with air as if reluctant to leave the drive. \"Our constitutional,\" he remarked, \"is abruptly at an end, Walter.\"\nThen he laughed, as he looked about him.\n\"What a place in which to plot a raid on Danfield's Vesper Club! Why, the nurse-maids have hardly got the children all in for supper and bed. It's incongruous. Well, I must go over to the laboratory and get some things ready to put in that van with the men. Meet me about half-past seven, Walter, up in the room, all togged up. We'll dine at the Cafe Riviera to-night in style. And, by the way, you're quite a man about town—you must know someone who can introduce us into the Vesper Club.\"\n\"But, Craig,\" I demurred, \"if there is any rough work as a result, it might queer me with them. They might object to being used—\"\n\"Oh, that will be all right. I just want to look the place over and lose a few chips in a good cause. No, it won't queer any of your Star connections. We'll be on the outside when the time comes for anything to happen. In fact I shouldn't wonder if your story would make you all the more solid with the sports. I take all the responsibility; you can have the glory. You know they like to hear the inside gossip of such things, after the event. Try it. Remember, at seven-thirty. We'll be a little late at dinner, but never mind; it will be early enough for the club.\"\nLEFT to my own devices I determined to do a little detective work on my own account, and not only did I succeed in finding an acquaintance who agreed to introduce us at the Vesper Club that night about nine o'clock, but I also learned that Percival DeLong was certain to be there that night, too. I was necessarily vague about Kennedy, for fear my friend might have heard of some of his exploits, but fortunately he did not prove inquisitive.\nI hurried back to our apartment and was in the process of transforming myself into a full-fledged boulevardier, when Kennedy arrived in an extremely cheerful frame of mind. So far, his preparations had progressed very favourably, I guessed, and I was quite elated when he complimented me on what I had accomplished in the meantime.\n\"Pretty tough for the fellows who are condemned to ride around in that van for four mortal hours, though,\" he said as he hurried into his evening clothes, \"but they won't be riding all the time. The driver will make frequent stops.\"\nI was so busy that I paid little attention to him until he had nearly completed his toilet. I gave a gasp.\n\"Why, whatever are you doing?\" I exclaimed as I glanced into his room.\nThere stood Kennedy arrayed in all the glory of a sharp-pointed moustache and a goatee. He had put on evening clothes of decidedly Parisian cut, clothes which he had used abroad and had brought back with him, but which I had never known him to wear since he came back. On a chair reposed a chimney-pot hat that would have been pronounced faultless on the \"continong,\" but was unknown, except among impresarios, on Broadway.\nKennedy shrugged his shoulders—he even had the shrug.\n\"Figure to yourself, monsieur,\" he said. \"Ze great Kennedy, ze detectif Americain—to put it tersely in our own vernacular, wouldn't it be a fool thing for me to appear at the Vesper Club where I should surely be recognised by someone if I went in my ordinary clothes and features? Un faux pas, at the start? Jamais!\"\nThere was nothing to do but agree, and I was glad that I had been discreetly reticent about my companion in talking with the friend who was to gain us entrance to the Avernus beyond the steel door.\nWE met my friend at the Riviera and dined sumptuously. Fortunately he seemed decidedly impressed with my friend Monsieur Kay—I could do no better on the spur of the moment than take Kennedy's initial, which seemed to serve. We progressed amicably from oysters and soup down to coffee, cigars, and liqueurs, and I succeeded in swallowing Kennedy's tales of Monte Carlo and Ostend and Ascot without even a smile. He must have heard them somewhere, and treasured them up for just such an occasion, but he told them in a manner that was verisimilitude itself, using perfect English with just the trace of an accent at the right places.\nAt last it was time to saunter around to the Vesper Club without seeming to be too indecently early. The theatres were not yet out, but my friend said play was just beginning at the club and would soon be in full swing.\nI had a keen sense of wickedness as we mounted the steps in the yellow flare of the flaming arc-light on the Broadway corner not far below us. A heavy, grated door swung open at the practised signal of my friend, and an obsequious negro servant stood bowing and pronouncing his name in the sombre mahogany portal beyond, with its green marble pillars and handsome decorations. A short parley followed, after which we entered, my friend having apparently satisfied someone that we were all right.\nWe did not stop to examine the first floor, which doubtless was innocent enough, but turned quickly up a flight of steps. At the foot of the broad staircase Kennedy paused to examine some rich carvings, and I felt him nudge me. I turned. It was an enclosed staircase, with walls that looked to be of re-enforced concrete. Swung back on hinges concealed like those of a modern burglar- proof safe was the famous steel door.\nWe did not wish to appear to be too interested, yet a certain amount of curiosity was only proper.\nMy friend paused on the steps, turned, and came back.\n\"You're perfectly safe,\" he smiled, tapping the door with his cane with a sort of affectionate respect. \"It would take the police ages to get past that barrier, which would be swung shut and bolted the moment the lookout gave the alarm. But there has never been any trouble. The police know that it is so far, no farther. Besides,\" he added with a wink to me, \"you know, Senator Danfield wouldn't like this pretty little door even scratched. Come up, I think I hear DeLong's voice up-stairs. You've heard of him, monsieur? It's said his luck has changed I'm anxious to find out.\"\nQuickly he led the way up the handsome staircase and into a large, lofty, richly furnished room. Everywhere there were thick, heavy carpets on the floors, into which your feet sank with an air of satisfying luxury.\nTHE room into which we entered was indeed absolutely windowless. It was a room built within the original room of the old house. Thus the windows overlooking the street from the second floor in reality bore no relation to it. For light it depended on a complete oval of lights overhead so arranged as to be themselves invisible, but shining through richly stained glass and conveying the illusion of a slightly clouded noonday. The absence of windows was made up for, as I learned later, by a ventilating device so perfect that, although everyone was smoking, a most fastidious person could scarcely have been offended by the odour of tobacco.\nOf course I did not notice all this at first. What I did notice, however, was a faro-layout and a hazard-board, but as no one was playing at either, my eye quickly travelled to a roulette-table which stretched along the middle of the room. Some ten or a dozen men in evening clothes were gathered watching with intent faces the spinning wheel. There was no money on the table, nothing but piles of chips of various denominations. Another thing that surprised me as I looked was that the tense look on the faces of the players was anything but the feverish, haggard gaze I had expected. In fact, they were sleek, well-fed, typical prosperous New-Yorkers rather inclined to the noticeable in dress and carrying their avoirdupois as if life was an easy game with them. Most of them evidently belonged to the financial and society classes. There were no tragedies; the tragedies were elsewhere—in their offices, homes, in the courts, anywhere, but not here at the club. Here all was life, light, and laughter.\nFor the benefit of those not acquainted with the roulette- wheel—and I may as well confess that most of my own knowledge was gained in that one crowded evening—I may say that it consists, briefly, of a wooden disc very nicely balanced and turning in the centre of a cavity set into a table like a circular wash-basin, with an outer rim turned slightly inward. The \"croupier\" revolves the wheel to the right. With a quick motion of his middle finger he flicks a marble, usually of ivory, to the left. At the Vesper Club, always up-to-date, the ball was of platinum, not of ivory. The disc with its sloping sides is provided with a number of brass rods, some perpendicular, some horizontal. As the ball and the wheel lose momentum the ball strikes against the rods and finally is deflected into one of the many little pockets or stalls facing the rim of the wheel.\nThere are thirty-eight of these pockets; two are marked \"0\" and \"00,\" the others numbered from one to thirty-six in an irregular and confusing order and painted alternately red and black. At each end of the table are thirty-six large squares correspondingly numbered and coloured. The \"0\" and \"00\" are of a neutral colour. Whenever the ball falls in the \"0\" or \"00\" the bank takes the stakes, or sweeps the the board. The Monte Carlo wheel has only one \"0,\" while the typical American has two, and the Chinese has four.\nTo one like myself who had read of the Continental gambling- houses with the clink of gold pieces on the table, and the croupier with his wooden rake noisily raking in the winnings of the bank, the comparative silence of the American game comes as a surprise.\nAs we advanced, we heard only the rattle of the ball, the click of the chips, and the monotonous tone of the spinner: \"Twenty- three, black. Eight, red. Seventeen, black.\" It was almost like the boys in a broker's office calling off the quotations of the ticker and marking them up on the board.\nLeaning forward, almost oblivious to the rest, was Percival DeLong, a tall, lithe, handsome young man, whose boyish face ill comported with the marks of dissipation clearly outlined on it. Such a boy, it flashed across my mind, ought to be studying the possible plays of football of an evening in the field-house after his dinner at the training-table, rather than the possible gyrations of the little platinum ball on the wheel.\n\"Curse the luck!\" he exclaimed, as \"17\" appeared again.\nA Hebrew banker staked a pile of chips on the \"17\" to come up a third time. A murmur of applause at his nerve ran through the circle. DeLong hesitated, as one who thought, \"Seventeen has come out twice—the odds against its coming again are too great, even though the winnings would be fabulous, for a good stake.\" He placed his next bet on another number.\n\"He's playing Lord Rosslyn's system, to-night,\" whispered my friend.\nThe wheel spun, the ball rolled, and the croupier called again, \"Seventeen, black.\" A tremor of excitement ran through the crowd. It was almost unprecedented.\nDeLong, with a stifled oath, leaned back and scanned the faces about the table.\n\"And '17' has precisely the same chance of turning up in the next spin as if it had not already had a run of three,\" said a voice at my elbow.\nIt was Kennedy. The roulette-table needs no introduction when curious sequences are afoot. All are friends.\n\"That's the theory of Sir Hiram Maxim;\" commented my friend, as he excused himself reluctantly for another appointment. \"But no true gambler will believe it, monsieur, or at least act on it.\"\nAll eyes were turned on Kennedy, who made a gesture of polite deprecation, as if the remark of my friend were true, but he nonchalantly placed his chips on the \"17.\"\n\"The odds against '17' appearing four consecutive times are some millions,\" he went on, \"and yet, having appeared three times, it is just as likely to appear again as before. It is the usual practice to avoid a number that has had a run, on the theory that some other number is more likely to come up than it is. That would be the case if it were drawing balls from a bag full of red and black balls—the more red ones drawn the smaller the chance of drawing another red one. But if the balls are put back in the bag after being drawn the chances of drawing a red one after three have been drawn are exactly the same as ever. If we toss a cent and heads appear twelve times, that does not have the slightest effect on the thirteenth toss—there is still an even chance that it, too, will be heads. So if '17' had come up five times to-night, it would be just as likely to come the sixth as if the previous five had not occurred, and that despite the fact that before it has appeared at all odds against a run of the same number six times in succession are about two billion, four hundred and ninety-six million, and some thousands. Most systems are based on the old persistent belief that occurrences of chance are affected in some way by occurrences immediately preceding, but disconnected physically. If we've had a run of black for twenty times, system says play the red for the twenty-first. But black is just as likely to turn up the twenty-first as if it were the first play of all. The confusion arises because a run of twenty on the black should happen once in one million, forty- eight thousand, five hundred and seventy-six coups. It would take ten years to make that many coups, and the run of twenty might occur once or any number of times in it. It is only when one deals with infinitely large numbers of coups that one can count on infinitely small variations in the mathematical results. This game does not go on for infinity—therefore anything, everything, may happen. Systems are based on the infinite; we play in the finite.\"\n\"You talk like a professor I had at the university,\" ejaculated DeLong contemptuously as Craig finished his disquisition on the practical fallibility of theoretically infallible systems. Again DeLong carefully avoided the \"17,\" as well as the black.\nThe wheel spun again; the ball rolled. The knot of spectators around the table watched with bated breath.\nSeventeen won!\nAs Kennedy piled up his winnings superciliously, without even the appearance of triumph, a man behind me whispered, \"A foreign nobleman with a system—watch him.\"\n\"Non, monsieur,\" said Kennedy quickly, having overheard the remark, \"no system, sir. There is only one system of which I know.\"\n\"What?\" asked DeLong eagerly.\nKennedy staked a large sum on the red to win. The black came up, and he lost. He doubled the stake and played again, and again lost. With amazing calmness Craig kept right on doubling.\n\"The martingale,\" I heard the man whisper behind me. \"In other words, double or quit.\"\nKennedy was now in for some hundreds, a sum that was sufficiently large for him, but he doubled again, still cheerfully playing the red, and the red won. As he gathered up his chips he rose.\n\"That's the only system,\" he said simply.\n\"But, go on, go on,\" came the chorus from about the table.\n\"No,\" said Kennedy quietly, \"that is part of the system, too—to quit when you have won back your stakes and a little more.\"\n\"Huh!\" exclaimed DeLong in disgust. \"Suppose you were in for some thousands—you wouldn't quit. If you had real sporting blood you wouldn't quit, anyhow!\"\nKennedy calmly passed over the open insult, letting it be understood that he ignored this beardless youth.\n\"There is no way you can beat the game in the long run if you keep at it,\" he answered simply. \"It is mathematically impossible. Consider. We are Croesuses—we hire players to stake money for us on every possible number at every coup. How do we come out? If there are no '0' or '00,' we come out after each coup precisely where we started—we are paying our own money back and forth among ourselves; we have neither more nor less. But with the '0' and '00' the bank sweeps the board every so often. It is only a question of time when, after paying our money back and forth among ourselves, it has all filtered through the '0' and '00' into the bank. It is not a game of chance for the bank—ah, it is exact, mathematical—c'est une question d' arithmetique, seulement, nest-ce pas, messieurs?\"\n\"Perhaps,\" admitted DeLong, \"but it doesn't explain why I am losing to-night while everyone else is winning.\"\n\"We are not winning,\" persisted Craig. \"After I have had a bite to eat I will demonstrate how to lose—by keeping on playing.\" He led the way to the cafe.\nDeLong was too intent on the game to leave, even for refreshments. Now and then I saw him beckon to an attendant, who brought him a stiff drink of whiskey. For a moment his play seemed a little better, then he would drop back into his hopeless losing. For some reason or other his \"system\" failed absolutely.\n\"You see, he is hopeless,\" mused Kennedy over our light repast. \"And yet of all gambling games roulette offers the player the best odds, far better than horse-racing, for instance. Our method has usually been to outlaw roulette and permit horse racing; in other words, suppress the more favourable and permit the less favourable. However, we're doing better now; we're suppressing both. Of course what I say applies only to roulette when it is honestly played—DeLong would lose anyhow, I fear.\"\nI started at Kennedy's tone and whispered hastily: \"What do you mean? Do you think the wheel is crooked?\"\n\"I haven't a doubt of it,\" he replied in an undertone. \"That run of '17' might happen—yes. But it is improbable. They let me win because I was a new player—new players always win at first. It is proverbial, but the man who is running this game has made it look like a platitude. To satisfy myself on that point I am going to play again—until I have lost my winnings and am just square with the game. When I reach the point that I am convinced that some crooked work is going on I am going to try a little experiment, Walter. I want you to stand close to me so that no one can see what I am doing. Do just as I will indicate to you.\"\nTHE gambling-room was now fast filling up with the first of the theatre crowd. DeLong's table was the centre of attraction, owing to the high play. A group of young men of his set were commiserating with him on his luck and discussing it with the finished air of roues of double their ages. He was doggedly following his system.\nKennedy and I approached.\n\"Ah, here is the philosophical stranger again;\" DeLong exclaimed, catching sight of Kennedy. \"Perhaps he can enlighten us on how to win at roulette by playing his own system.\"\n\"Au contrarie, monsieur, let me demonstrate how to lose,\" answered Craig with a smile that showed a row of faultless teeth beneath his black moustache, decidedly foreign.\nKennedy played and lost, and lost again; then he won, but in the main he lost. After one particularly large loss I felt his arm on mine, drawing me closely to him. DeLong had taken a sort of grim pleasure in the fact that Kennedy, too, was losing. I found that Craig had paused in his play at a moment when DeLong had staked a large sum that a number below \"18\" would turn up—for five plays the numbers had been between \"18\" and \"36.\" Curious to see what Craig was doing, I looked cautiously down between us. All eyes were fixed on the wheel. \n\nProvide a comprehensive summary (between 600 and 900 words long) of the key events, information, and important details from this document."

  "final_summary": "“The Steel Door” is a detective story set against the backdrop of a determined crusade to suppress high-class gambling in New York City, focusing on the notorious Vesper Club, an exclusive and well-protected gambling resort linked to influential figures like Senator Danfield. The narrative begins on a crisp autumn afternoon with two friends, the narrator and Kennedy, enjoying a serene stroll along the Hudson when they are interrupted by the arrival of First Deputy Police Commissioner O’Connor. O’Connor, new to his position under a reform-minded mayor, confides his ambitious plan to conduct a daring and conspicuous raid on the Vesper Club. Despite political risks and his precarious career position, O'Connor is resolved to take bold action against this emblem of corruption, even if it means stepping on the powerful toes of society’s elite.\n\nHis motivation is underscored by a poignant and confidential letter from Mrs. Julia M. DeLong, a concerned and grieving mother from New York’s social set. She pleads with O’Connor to shut down the Vesper Club, which she describes as a “gambling hell” responsible for ruining her only son, Percival DeLong, through devastating losses. The story highlights the contrast between social standing and personal tragedy: though the DeLong family is prominent and not wealthy, Mrs. DeLong is human and desperate, emphasizing the ruin that the Vesper Club has brought on her son and her own health. This letter personalizes the fight against the gambling club and illustrates the moral imperative fueling O’Connor’s risky project.\n\nKennedy, whose keen insight into police strategy rivals that of O’Connor, reveals his confidence in being able to bypass the Vesper Club’s formidable defenses, especially its “famous steel door” — a three-inch thick, bomb-proof, armored barrier that protects the private and windowless second-floor gambling room. This room, unseen from the outside, is ventilated with an advanced system that effectively erases odors like tobacco smoke and brightly lit with electric lights mimicking daylight, an ultra-modern setup ensuring secrecy and comfort for high stakes gamblers. The door’s design and the club’s many lookouts render traditional raids ineffective. Kennedy promises to get the police past this door with finesse, using an approach that avoids violence and destruction, crucial in maintaining legitimacy and public support.\n\nTogether they plan the raid with carefully orchestrated logistics: a padded closed van from a storage warehouse will discreetly carry twelve men and concealed equipment to the vicinity of the club, blending in with the theatre crowd. The men are to be dropped off individually near Kennedy’s laboratory before the raid. Kennedy, adopting the alias Monsieur Kay and posing as a suave European gambler with a Parisian flair—including a goatee, pointed mustache, and evening clothes of foreign cut—prepares to infiltrate the club to gather firsthand intelligence. His transformation into a mysterious and sophisticated figure is essential for access and for observing the club’s operations discreetly.\n\nIn preparation for the raid, the narrator arranges for a friend to introduce them into the Vesper Club that evening, learning that Percival DeLong will be present. Their entry to the club reveals the grandiose exterior with green marble pillars and a polished mahogany entrance. They bypass the seemingly innocent first floor and head upstairs to the critical second floor, where the steel door stands as the ultimate obstacle. The narrator describes the scene inside: a lavish, windowless room bustling with wealthy men in evening attire, deeply engaged in gaming at various tables—faro, hazard, and notably, a roulette table illuminated as if in daylight by cleverly hidden overhead lights.\n\nThe unfolding scene reveals a curious mix of elegance and tension. Despite the heavy stakes, the gamblers appear well-fed, prosperous, and composed, contrasting with the often expected haggard and desperate demeanor of gamblers in less elite establishments. The narrator explains in detail the mechanisms of roulette—a game of chance involving a spinning wheel, a marble (in this club, of platinum), and numbered pockets including “0” and “00.” The dynamics and probabilities are discussed, noting differences between American and European roulette wheels and debunking popular myths about “systems” and streaks at the game.\n\nAt the gambling table, Percival DeLong is observed struggling with bad luck despite using a known “system” akin to Lord Rosslyn’s. Kennedy offers a pragmatic lecture on the mathematics of chance versus gambler’s superstition, explaining that each spin of roulette is independent, and past outcomes do not influence future results—a rational but unfavored truth in gambling circles. He demonstrates his understanding by betting on number “17” repeatedly, which had improbably come up three times in a row, stirring astonishment and suspicion among the onlookers. Through his calm and deliberate betting, Kennedy begins to expose how the game might actually be rigged.\n\nKennedy explains the “martingale” system, where a player doubles the stake after each loss intending to recover all past losses plus win a profit. While Kennedy briefly employs this strategy in the club but soon returns to his losses, he underscores the futility in beating the house in the long run. He claims that the game is mathematically designed to favor the bank permanently, especially because of the “0” and “00” pockets which tilt odds definitively in the house’s favor.\n\nThe narrative closes with Kennedy planning an experiment to prove the crookedness of the roulette wheel, requesting the narrator’s assistance in observing his strategy closely to expose cheating or manipulation. The social scene thickens with gambling crowd dynamics as DeLong stubbornly continues to lose despite advice. The environment is thick with tension masked by civility and wealth, setting the stage for the impending raid not just as a police operation but as an exposure of deep-seated corruption entwined with the upper echelons of New York society. \n\n“The Steel Door” intricately weaves the elements of social prestige, gambling mathematics, police procedural, and personal tragedy. It highlights the challenges of enforcing the law against a fortress-like establishment designed to evade justice, the ethical and practical dilemmas of undercover investigation, and the human cost of gambling addiction, all under the looming threat of political and social retaliation. The story is a compelling portrayal of a high-stakes battle between reformist law enforcement and entrenched vice protected by wealth and power, promising an action-packed culmination as the raid on the Vesper Club approaches.",
