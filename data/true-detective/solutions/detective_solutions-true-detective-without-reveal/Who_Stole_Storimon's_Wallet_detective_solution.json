    "full_text": "Mick was the smartest guy in my neighborhood. Sure he was homeless, but Mick took that as proof of how smart he was. Hebragged that he never had to pay rent, and he never worried about paying car insurance. Every morning he'd sit at the bus stop and laugh at all the people who had to go to work. There was only one thing Mick was afraid of -- the police. There were laws against vagrancy, because, as Mick pointed out, \"People always assume homeless people will eventually rob them.\" We were standing at the bus stop, and the sun was just coming up. I'd missed the 8:30 bus, and I'd have to wait for the 8:50. But in the next 20 minutes, I'd also be solving a mystery. Mick was sitting on the bench at the bus stop, and it looked like he was actually humming. I thought he'd be cold and grumpy, but he'd bundled himself up in a spiffy spring outfit -- a brown scarf, a brown ski cap and thick brown mittens. I reminded myself that I'd have a warm apartment and a roof over my head tonight -- but it still seemed like Mick was happier than me. \"How long you going to be at work today?\" Mick asked enthusiastically. \"Eight hours,\" I said. \"Do you have to ask permission to leave your desk?\" he asked playfully. I looked down, trying to think up a good comeback, and Mick laughed delightedly. \"Hope it's worth it,\" he said. And that's when we saw Mr. Storimon. A cab was pulling up to the curb, but its door swung open before the cab had even reached the bus stop. Mr. Storimon exploded out of the door, trying to yank his wallet out of his pants pocket with one hand while pulling his expensive overcoat onto his shoulder with the other hand. He'd worked for 40 years at a bank downtown, but nobody really liked him. It was obvious he wanted respect after all that hard work -- but he treated people rudely, which made everyone be rude back to him. His white hair and pale skin almost matched the overcoat's color, and he looked like an angry snowman. \"How much?\" he barked at the cab driver, and when the cab driver said \"$19.90,\" Mr. Storimon gave him a twenty-dollar bill. (\"Not much of a tipper,\" Mick whispered to me with a laugh.) Storimon tried to slide the wallet back into his pocket, but apparently he missed. As he rushed to the bus stop, we heard it flop into a puddle on the street behind him . \"Let's see how long it takes before he notices,\" I said mischievously to Mick. It was even funnier when Mr. Storimon glared at Mick. \"No, I'm not giving you a handout.\" \"I'm not asking you for one,\" said Mick. \"You need to earn money.\" \"I've got money,\" said Mick. \"Well, then you need to learn how to hang onto it.\" \"So do you,\" I said. Mick and I laughed. Mr. Storimon glared, and I felt a little sorry for him as he muttered something obscene and then started reading the Wall Street Journal. \"People are funny,\" I whispered to Mick. Now I could see now why he enjoyed hanging out at the bus stop. I closed my eyes for a quick nap, but when I opened them someone else was at the bus stop. Wearing a loose Metallica shirt, a punk rocker had rolled up silently on his skateboard. I wondered what Mr. Storimon would do when he noticed... Danny's hair was cropped short, and he looked like he could be part of the band but he'd obviously been skateboarding for a while, because his face was covered with sweat. Maybe that's why he wanted to take the bus. When he got to its stop, Danny stepped off the skateboard and gave it a trick kick. It suddenly rose up off of the sidewalk, and Danny grabbed it without even bending over. He didn't say a word, but it was obvious he was trying to impress us. Mr. Storimon just rustled his newspaper. Danny didn't move -- he just stood there trying to look cool. In his own way, he seemed even lonelier than Mr. Storimon, and I felt sorry for him, too. Mick offered him a piece of gum. As Danny opened the gum and put it in his mouth, I noticed that his left hand was in a cast that went all the way to his elbow. For some reason, this made Mick laugh. \"He can't be that good of a skater,\" Mick whispered to me, \"if he's broken his left arm.\" Danny glared, then asked Mick \"Do you ever have any trouble with the cops?\" Mick nodded, and Danny said he understood. \"I'm always getting in trouble for skating where I shouldn't be. But skateboarding shouldn't be illegal. It's a form of exercise, just like riding your bike!\" \"You should both get a job,\" muttered Mr. Storimon. \"I started my first company with just a $100 dollar bill.\" But Mick didn't say anything. He had a scared look on his face, and he started looking around like he was trying to find someplace to hide. Looking up the street, I realized what had scared him. It was a police officer. He was eating an enormous doughnut, and he looked pretty happy, even if he wasn't smiling. There was a smudge of chocolate on his cheek, which almost matched the black uniform he was wearing. He looked over at the bus stop, like he was hoping none of the four of us were going to interrupt his breakfast. Mick looked down at the sidewalk and tried not to make eye contact. The police officer had just gobbled his first chocolate-filled bite of the shiny glazed doughnut, chewed for a moment, and then mumbled, \"Everything all right here?\" Danny didn't say anything, and I looked over at Mr. Storimon, who seemed thoroughly disinterested. \"Yes, everything's all right,\" he grumbled, reaching his hand into his pocket. And then suddenly, he realized his wallet was missing. \"No!\" Mr. Storimon shouted. \"Somebody's stolen my wallet!\" Mr. Storimon patted every one of his pockets, while his flustered white head looked in every direction. I smiled to myself, and was about to point out that he'd dropped his wallet --but the police officer insisted that everyone be quiet and asked if Mr. Storimon was sure that he'd had his wallet with him. \"Yes! I had it when I got out of the taxi!\" Mr. Storimon blustered. \"It's true,\" I said. \"I saw him pay the cab driver. But -- \" \"Maybe he stole it!\" Mr. Storimon shouted accusingly at Mick. \"I didn't!\" Mick insisted. But the police officer looked over curiously to where Mick and Danny were standing. \"Don't look at me, dude,\" Danny said quickly. \"Hold it!\" I said. \"The wallet's in the street! It fell out of his pocket when he got out of the cab, and nobody stole anything.\" Everyone was quiet for a second, until the police officer strolled over to the puddle by the curb and found the \"missing\" wallet. \"Is this yours?\" he said to Mr. Storimon, holding up the wallet. Mick started laughing, which made Mr. Storimon's white face turn red. \"We all saw you drop it. And then you told me I should hold on to my money. Whenever anything's missing, they always want to blame the homeless guy.\" \"Or the skater punk,\" added Danny. \"No one's blaming anybody,\" Mr. Storimon said. Soon everyone at the bus stop was engaged in a furious debate about the city's law enforcement policies. It took a couple of minutes before the police officer could get Mr. Storimon to stop arguing long enough to take the wallet out of the police officer's hand. \"If city ordinance number 213 had passed on the April ballot...\" Danny was screaming. \"Hold it!\" shouted Mr. Storimon. \"My money's missing!\" \"What?\" said the four of us -- all speaking at exactly the same time. Then everyone stopped talking, and the bus stop was silent. \"My wallet was full of hundred dollar bills,\" Mr. Storimond said. \"Sometimes I'll flash one around when I'm telling the story of the company I founded.\" Then he held out a handful of green bills, and fanned them so we could see. \"All of my hundred dollar bills are gone.\" Sure enough, there were no hundreds or even fifties -- nothing but clean, crisp $20 dollar bills -- but not a $100 bill anywhere. \"This is your idea of a joke,\" he said angrily to the homeless man, \"because I told you I'd started my company with a hundred dollar bill.\" \"No way, dude,\" said Danny. \"How do we know the old guy's telling the truth?\" I told him I didn't think Mick would steal his money, but Mr. Storimon said angrily \"You were napping. You don't know what anyone was doing. You didn't wake up until after the kid on the skateboard got here. Even he could've stolen the money by the time you got your eyes open.\" \"I think the police officer did it,\" Mick said. \"While we were arguing, he lifted the hundreds for himself. Then he'd finally have an excuse to arrest the homeless guy.\" The old man stared, the skateboarder glared, and the police officer took a second bite of his chocolate-filled doughnut. Fortunately, I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could have got at the money?  \n   – While the wallet lay in the puddle no-one went near it except, later, the police officer.  \n   – Anyone who had wanted to remove notes beforehand would have had to pick the wallet up, open it, sort the notes and then put it back in exactly the same puddle without being seen.  \n   – During that whole interval Mr Storimon was standing scarcely a metre away reading the paper, Mick was sitting beside the narrator, and the narrator himself dozed only a minute or two.  Any movement toward the gutter would have been obvious.\n\n2. Who actually had the wallet in his hands?  \n   – Only the officer ever touched it.  He lifted it out of the puddle and then kept hold of it “for a couple of minutes” while everybody argued, before he finally let Storimon take it.  That gave him both possession and privacy enough to open it.\n\n3. Physical constraints on the others  \n   – Mick was wearing thick, wet-absorbing mittens: taking them off, opening a soaked wallet, choosing just the $100 bills and getting the wallet back into a puddle would have been slow and conspicuous.  \n   – Danny’s left arm was in a full cast; with only one usable hand he could not easily hold the wallet open and sort notes, least of all while balancing a skateboard.  \n   – The narrator never touched the wallet; the cab has already driven away.\n\n4. Behavioural clues  \n   – The officer, not Mr Storimon, insisted on holding the wallet even after it had been identified; that was unnecessary other than to give himself time.  \n   – Only the $100 bills vanished.  A petty thief (Mick or Danny) would almost certainly have taken all the cash, not just the largest denominations; limiting the take to the high notes is exactly what someone who must be able to hand the wallet back a few minutes later would do.  \n   – As soon as the loss is announced Mick points at the officer – classic projection: he knows who had the chance.  \n   – The officer keeps his doughnut in one hand; the other is free.  A momentary “bite” gives him a pretext for bringing both hands together and slipping the folded hundreds into a pocket while everyone else is shouting about city-ordinance 213.\n\n5. Motive  \n   – Only the police officer gains anything tangible (several hundred dollars).  Mick and Danny would still be stuck at the same bus stop, and Storimon would only gain embarrassment by inventing the theft.\n\nHence the only person with motive, unobstructed opportunity, and physical possession of the wallet is the policeman.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMick (the homeless man), Danny (the skateboarder), Officer ­­­­­­­(unnamed policeman), Mr. Storimon, Narrator\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nThe police officer (name not given)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• 8:33 a.m. Mr Storimon jumps from the taxi, pays with a $20, drops his wallet in the puddle.  \n• 8:34-8:40 The wallet lies where it fell; everybody is either on the bench or reading a newspaper.  \n• 8:40 a.m. The officer approaches, eating a doughnut.  \n• 8:41 a.m. Storimon misses his wallet, the officer retrieves it.  \n• 8:41-8:43 a.m. While the others argue about vagrancy and skateboarding, the officer, standing a step behind them, flips the wallet open, removes the $100 bills, folds them and slips them into his trouser pocket.  With his other hand he keeps the doughnut moving to his mouth so no one notices the brief manipulation.  \n• 8:43 a.m. He still holds the wallet aloft until Storimon finally accepts it.  \n• 8:44 a.m. Storimon opens the wallet, discovers the high-value notes gone, and the accusation frenzy begins.  \n• 8:45 a.m. The narrator has already put the pieces together: only the officer could have done it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMick – Never handled the wallet and would have been seen leaving the bench; heavy mittens make delicate work impossible without removal, which nobody saw.\n\nDanny – Arrived after the wallet dropped; with one arm in a full cast he could not open the wallet and fish out only certain notes unnoticed; moreover, the wallet was still lying in the puddle when the police officer picked it up.\n\nMr Storimon – He lost money, he did not gain it; claiming theft only embarrasses him further.\n\nNarrator – Observes but never touches the wallet.\n\nTherefore the police officer is the only logical thief. \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It took a couple of minutes before the police officer could get Mr. Storimon to stop arguing long enough to take the wallet out of the police officer's hand. \"If city ordinance number 213 had passed on the April ballot...\" Danny was screaming. \"Hold it!\" shouted Mr. Storimon. \"My money's missing!\" \"What?\" said the four of us -- all speaking at exactly the same time. Then everyone stopped talking, and the bus stop was silent. \"My wallet was full of hundred dollar bills,\" Mr. Storimond said. \"Sometimes I'll flash one around when I'm telling the story of the company I founded.\" Then he held out a handful of green bills, and fanned them so we could see. \"All of my hundred dollar bills are gone.\" Sure enough, there were no hundreds or even fifties -- nothing but clean, crisp $20 dollar bills -- but not a $100 bill anywhere. \"This is your idea of a joke,\" he said angrily to the homeless man, \"because I told you I'd started my company with a hundred dollar bill.\" \"No way, dude,\" said Danny. \"How do we know the old guy's telling the truth?\" I told him I didn't think Mick would steal his money, but Mr. Storimon said angrily \"You were napping. You don't know what anyone was doing. You didn't wake up until after the kid on the skateboard got here. Even he could've stolen the money by the time you got your eyes open.\" \"I think the police officer did it,\" Mick said. \"While we were arguing, he lifted the hundreds for himself. Then he'd finally have an excuse to arrest the homeless guy.\" The old man stared, the skateboarder glared, and the police officer took a second bite of his chocolate-filled doughnut. Fortunately, I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

      "mystery_text": "Mick was the smartest guy in my neighborhood. Sure he was homeless, but Mick took that as proof of how smart he was. Hebragged that he never had to pay rent, and he never worried about paying car insurance. Every morning he'd sit at the bus stop and laugh at all the people who had to go to work. There was only one thing Mick was afraid of -- the police. There were laws against vagrancy, because, as Mick pointed out, \"People always assume homeless people will eventually rob them.\" We were standing at the bus stop, and the sun was just coming up. I'd missed the 8:30 bus, and I'd have to wait for the 8:50. But in the next 20 minutes, I'd also be solving a mystery. Mick was sitting on the bench at the bus stop, and it looked like he was actually humming. I thought he'd be cold and grumpy, but he'd bundled himself up in a spiffy spring outfit -- a brown scarf, a brown ski cap and thick brown mittens. I reminded myself that I'd have a warm apartment and a roof over my head tonight -- but it still seemed like Mick was happier than me. \"How long you going to be at work today?\" Mick asked enthusiastically. \"Eight hours,\" I said. \"Do you have to ask permission to leave your desk?\" he asked playfully. I looked down, trying to think up a good comeback, and Mick laughed delightedly. \"Hope it's worth it,\" he said. And that's when we saw Mr. Storimon. A cab was pulling up to the curb, but its door swung open before the cab had even reached the bus stop. Mr. Storimon exploded out of the door, trying to yank his wallet out of his pants pocket with one hand while pulling his expensive overcoat onto his shoulder with the other hand. He'd worked for 40 years at a bank downtown, but nobody really liked him. It was obvious he wanted respect after all that hard work -- but he treated people rudely, which made everyone be rude back to him. His white hair and pale skin almost matched the overcoat's color, and he looked like an angry snowman. \"How much?\" he barked at the cab driver, and when the cab driver said \"$19.90,\" Mr. Storimon gave him a twenty-dollar bill. (\"Not much of a tipper,\" Mick whispered to me with a laugh.) Storimon tried to slide the wallet back into his pocket, but apparently he missed. As he rushed to the bus stop, we heard it flop into a puddle on the street behind him . \"Let's see how long it takes before he notices,\" I said mischievously to Mick. It was even funnier when Mr. Storimon glared at Mick. \"No, I'm not giving you a handout.\" \"I'm not asking you for one,\" said Mick. \"You need to earn money.\" \"I've got money,\" said Mick. \"Well, then you need to learn how to hang onto it.\" \"So do you,\" I said. Mick and I laughed. Mr. Storimon glared, and I felt a little sorry for him as he muttered something obscene and then started reading the Wall Street Journal. \"People are funny,\" I whispered to Mick. Now I could see now why he enjoyed hanging out at the bus stop. I closed my eyes for a quick nap, but when I opened them someone else was at the bus stop. Wearing a loose Metallica shirt, a punk rocker had rolled up silently on his skateboard. I wondered what Mr. Storimon would do when he noticed... Danny's hair was cropped short, and he looked like he could be part of the band but he'd obviously been skateboarding for a while, because his face was covered with sweat. Maybe that's why he wanted to take the bus. When he got to its stop, Danny stepped off the skateboard and gave it a trick kick. It suddenly rose up off of the sidewalk, and Danny grabbed it without even bending over. He didn't say a word, but it was obvious he was trying to impress us. Mr. Storimon just rustled his newspaper. Danny didn't move -- he just stood there trying to look cool. In his own way, he seemed even lonelier than Mr. Storimon, and I felt sorry for him, too. Mick offered him a piece of gum. As Danny opened the gum and put it in his mouth, I noticed that his left hand was in a cast that went all the way to his elbow. For some reason, this made Mick laugh. \"He can't be that good of a skater,\" Mick whispered to me, \"if he's broken his left arm.\" Danny glared, then asked Mick \"Do you ever have any trouble with the cops?\" Mick nodded, and Danny said he understood. \"I'm always getting in trouble for skating where I shouldn't be. But skateboarding shouldn't be illegal. It's a form of exercise, just like riding your bike!\" \"You should both get a job,\" muttered Mr. Storimon. \"I started my first company with just a $100 dollar bill.\" But Mick didn't say anything. He had a scared look on his face, and he started looking around like he was trying to find someplace to hide. Looking up the street, I realized what had scared him. It was a police officer. He was eating an enormous doughnut, and he looked pretty happy, even if he wasn't smiling. There was a smudge of chocolate on his cheek, which almost matched the black uniform he was wearing. He looked over at the bus stop, like he was hoping none of the four of us were going to interrupt his breakfast. Mick looked down at the sidewalk and tried not to make eye contact. The police officer had just gobbled his first chocolate-filled bite of the shiny glazed doughnut, chewed for a moment, and then mumbled, \"Everything all right here?\" Danny didn't say anything, and I looked over at Mr. Storimon, who seemed thoroughly disinterested. \"Yes, everything's all right,\" he grumbled, reaching his hand into his pocket. And then suddenly, he realized his wallet was missing. \"No!\" Mr. Storimon shouted. \"Somebody's stolen my wallet!\" Mr. Storimon patted every one of his pockets, while his flustered white head looked in every direction. I smiled to myself, and was about to point out that he'd dropped his wallet --but the police officer insisted that everyone be quiet and asked if Mr. Storimon was sure that he'd had his wallet with him. \"Yes! I had it when I got out of the taxi!\" Mr. Storimon blustered. \"It's true,\" I said. \"I saw him pay the cab driver. But -- \" \"Maybe he stole it!\" Mr. Storimon shouted accusingly at Mick. \"I didn't!\" Mick insisted. But the police officer looked over curiously to where Mick and Danny were standing. \"Don't look at me, dude,\" Danny said quickly. \"Hold it!\" I said. \"The wallet's in the street! It fell out of his pocket when he got out of the cab, and nobody stole anything.\" Everyone was quiet for a second, until the police officer strolled over to the puddle by the curb and found the \"missing\" wallet. \"Is this yours?\" he said to Mr. Storimon, holding up the wallet. Mick started laughing, which made Mr. Storimon's white face turn red. \"We all saw you drop it. And then you told me I should hold on to my money. Whenever anything's missing, they always want to blame the homeless guy.\" \"Or the skater punk,\" added Danny. \"No one's blaming anybody,\" Mr. Storimon said. Soon everyone at the bus stop was engaged in a furious debate about the city's law enforcement policies.
