    "full_text": "Mick was the smartest guy in my neighborhood. Sure he was homeless, but Mick took that as proof of how smart he was. Hebragged that he never had to pay rent, and he never worried about paying car insurance. Every morning he'd sit at the bus stop and laugh at all the people who had to go to work. There was only one thing Mick was afraid of -- the police. There were laws against vagrancy, because, as Mick pointed out, \"People always assume homeless people will eventually rob them.\" We were standing at the bus stop, and the sun was just coming up. I'd missed the 8:30 bus, and I'd have to wait for the 8:50. But in the next 20 minutes, I'd also be solving a mystery. Mick was sitting on the bench at the bus stop, and it looked like he was actually humming. I thought he'd be cold and grumpy, but he'd bundled himself up in a spiffy spring outfit -- a brown scarf, a brown ski cap and thick brown mittens. I reminded myself that I'd have a warm apartment and a roof over my head tonight -- but it still seemed like Mick was happier than me. \"How long you going to be at work today?\" Mick asked enthusiastically. \"Eight hours,\" I said. \"Do you have to ask permission to leave your desk?\" he asked playfully. I looked down, trying to think up a good comeback, and Mick laughed delightedly. \"Hope it's worth it,\" he said. And that's when we saw Mr. Storimon. A cab was pulling up to the curb, but its door swung open before the cab had even reached the bus stop. Mr. Storimon exploded out of the door, trying to yank his wallet out of his pants pocket with one hand while pulling his expensive overcoat onto his shoulder with the other hand. He'd worked for 40 years at a bank downtown, but nobody really liked him. It was obvious he wanted respect after all that hard work -- but he treated people rudely, which made everyone be rude back to him. His white hair and pale skin almost matched the overcoat's color, and he looked like an angry snowman. \"How much?\" he barked at the cab driver, and when the cab driver said \"$19.90,\" Mr. Storimon gave him a twenty-dollar bill. (\"Not much of a tipper,\" Mick whispered to me with a laugh.) Storimon tried to slide the wallet back into his pocket, but apparently he missed. As he rushed to the bus stop, we heard it flop into a puddle on the street behind him . \"Let's see how long it takes before he notices,\" I said mischievously to Mick. It was even funnier when Mr. Storimon glared at Mick. \"No, I'm not giving you a handout.\" \"I'm not asking you for one,\" said Mick. \"You need to earn money.\" \"I've got money,\" said Mick. \"Well, then you need to learn how to hang onto it.\" \"So do you,\" I said. Mick and I laughed. Mr. Storimon glared, and I felt a little sorry for him as he muttered something obscene and then started reading the Wall Street Journal. \"People are funny,\" I whispered to Mick. Now I could see now why he enjoyed hanging out at the bus stop. I closed my eyes for a quick nap, but when I opened them someone else was at the bus stop. Wearing a loose Metallica shirt, a punk rocker had rolled up silently on his skateboard. I wondered what Mr. Storimon would do when he noticed... Danny's hair was cropped short, and he looked like he could be part of the band but he'd obviously been skateboarding for a while, because his face was covered with sweat. Maybe that's why he wanted to take the bus. When he got to its stop, Danny stepped off the skateboard and gave it a trick kick. It suddenly rose up off of the sidewalk, and Danny grabbed it without even bending over. He didn't say a word, but it was obvious he was trying to impress us. Mr. Storimon just rustled his newspaper. Danny didn't move -- he just stood there trying to look cool. In his own way, he seemed even lonelier than Mr. Storimon, and I felt sorry for him, too. Mick offered him a piece of gum. As Danny opened the gum and put it in his mouth, I noticed that his left hand was in a cast that went all the way to his elbow. For some reason, this made Mick laugh. \"He can't be that good of a skater,\" Mick whispered to me, \"if he's broken his left arm.\" Danny glared, then asked Mick \"Do you ever have any trouble with the cops?\" Mick nodded, and Danny said he understood. \"I'm always getting in trouble for skating where I shouldn't be. But skateboarding shouldn't be illegal. It's a form of exercise, just like riding your bike!\" \"You should both get a job,\" muttered Mr. Storimon. \"I started my first company with just a $100 dollar bill.\" But Mick didn't say anything. He had a scared look on his face, and he started looking around like he was trying to find someplace to hide. Looking up the street, I realized what had scared him. It was a police officer. He was eating an enormous doughnut, and he looked pretty happy, even if he wasn't smiling. There was a smudge of chocolate on his cheek, which almost matched the black uniform he was wearing. He looked over at the bus stop, like he was hoping none of the four of us were going to interrupt his breakfast. Mick looked down at the sidewalk and tried not to make eye contact. The police officer had just gobbled his first chocolate-filled bite of the shiny glazed doughnut, chewed for a moment, and then mumbled, \"Everything all right here?\" Danny didn't say anything, and I looked over at Mr. Storimon, who seemed thoroughly disinterested. \"Yes, everything's all right,\" he grumbled, reaching his hand into his pocket. And then suddenly, he realized his wallet was missing. \"No!\" Mr. Storimon shouted. \"Somebody's stolen my wallet!\" Mr. Storimon patted every one of his pockets, while his flustered white head looked in every direction. I smiled to myself, and was about to point out that he'd dropped his wallet --but the police officer insisted that everyone be quiet and asked if Mr. Storimon was sure that he'd had his wallet with him. \"Yes! I had it when I got out of the taxi!\" Mr. Storimon blustered. \"It's true,\" I said. \"I saw him pay the cab driver. But -- \" \"Maybe he stole it!\" Mr. Storimon shouted accusingly at Mick. \"I didn't!\" Mick insisted. But the police officer looked over curiously to where Mick and Danny were standing. \"Don't look at me, dude,\" Danny said quickly. \"Hold it!\" I said. \"The wallet's in the street! It fell out of his pocket when he got out of the cab, and nobody stole anything.\" Everyone was quiet for a second, until the police officer strolled over to the puddle by the curb and found the \"missing\" wallet. \"Is this yours?\" he said to Mr. Storimon, holding up the wallet. Mick started laughing, which made Mr. Storimon's white face turn red. \"We all saw you drop it. And then you told me I should hold on to my money. Whenever anything's missing, they always want to blame the homeless guy.\" \"Or the skater punk,\" added Danny. \"No one's blaming anybody,\" Mr. Storimon said. Soon everyone at the bus stop was engaged in a furious debate about the city's law enforcement policies. It took a couple of minutes before the police officer could get Mr. Storimon to stop arguing long enough to take the wallet out of the police officer's hand. \"If city ordinance number 213 had passed on the April ballot...\" Danny was screaming. \"Hold it!\" shouted Mr. Storimon. \"My money's missing!\" \"What?\" said the four of us -- all speaking at exactly the same time. Then everyone stopped talking, and the bus stop was silent. \"My wallet was full of hundred dollar bills,\" Mr. Storimond said. \"Sometimes I'll flash one around when I'm telling the story of the company I founded.\" Then he held out a handful of green bills, and fanned them so we could see. \"All of my hundred dollar bills are gone.\" Sure enough, there were no hundreds or even fifties -- nothing but clean, crisp $20 dollar bills -- but not a $100 bill anywhere. \"This is your idea of a joke,\" he said angrily to the homeless man, \"because I told you I'd started my company with a hundred dollar bill.\" \"No way, dude,\" said Danny. \"How do we know the old guy's telling the truth?\" I told him I didn't think Mick would steal his money, but Mr. Storimon said angrily \"You were napping. You don't know what anyone was doing. You didn't wake up until after the kid on the skateboard got here. Even he could've stolen the money by the time you got your eyes open.\" \"I think the police officer did it,\" Mick said. \"While we were arguing, he lifted the hundreds for himself. Then he'd finally have an excuse to arrest the homeless guy.\" The old man stared, the skateboarder glared, and the police officer took a second bite of his chocolate-filled doughnut. Fortunately, I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. ​Fix the moment when the wallet could first be touched  \n   •  It lay in a puddle from the instant Storimon stepped out of the taxi until the policeman walked over and picked it up.  \n   •  In the narrative no one is described as leaving the shelter of the stop or bending down to the gutter during that interval.  \n   •  Therefore the FIRST human hand that certainly touched the wallet after it fell was the police officer’s.\n\n2. ​Check who had the wallet in his possession long enough to fish bills out of it  \n   •  The officer did.  He picked it up, walked back, and then held it “for a couple of minutes” while everyone argued, before Storimon finally accepted it.  \n   •  During those minutes every eye was on the quarrel, not on the officer.  He had both the time and privacy needed to pull the $100-bills out.\n\n3. ​Could anybody else have done it earlier?  \n   •  Mick – He never left the bench; he is wearing thick brown mittens that would be dripping mud if he had scooped a wallet out of a puddle.  They are described later as perfectly dry.  \n   •  Danny – Arrives after the narrator’s nap, stands still and “tries to look cool.”  A boy with a cast to the elbow cannot open a wet leather wallet, remove a neat stack of bills, replace the wallet and drop it back into the water without being seen.  \n   •  The narrator – He was dozing and never touched the wallet; every move he makes is reported in the first person, and none involve the curb.  \n   •  Cab-driver – has already driven away.\n\n4. ​Physical clue – the bills that remain are “clean, crisp $20 bills.”  \n   •  A wallet that lay in a street puddle would leave its contents damp and smeared – yet the twenties are immaculate.  Someone must have replaced the wet hundred-dollar bills with **dry** twenties after the wallet was lifted from the water.  Only the officer had the wallet long enough **after** it left the puddle.\n\n5. ​Motive  \n   •  The homeless man and the skater both want money, but each knows the police are standing right there.  \n   •  The police officer, on the other hand, knows any accusation will automatically be aimed at the “usual suspects.”  He can enrich himself and frame the vagrant or the teenager at the same time.  His calm chewing of the doughnut shows he is counting on that very prejudice.\n\nLogical conclusion – the only person who both actually had the wallet in his hands and had a concealed opportunity to substitute dry twenties for wet hundreds is the police officer.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMick (the homeless man), Danny (the skateboarder), Officer ­­­(the policeman), The narrator\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nthe Policeman (the only police officer at the bus stop)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Storimon drops his wallet into the puddle when he climbs out of the cab.  \n•  It lies there, soaking, while Mick, the narrator and later Danny talk.  Nobody touches it.  \n•  The policeman arrives, is told where the wallet is, walks over and picks it up.  It is wet.  \n•  Returning to the shelter, he keeps the wallet in the hand not occupied with his doughnut.  An argument about vagrancy and skateboarding starts and everyone’s attention turns to each other.  \n•  During those “couple of minutes” the officer casually flips the wallet open, removes the (wet) $100 bills, stuffs them into a pocket inside his jacket, and slips a handful of dry $20 bills (taken earlier from his own wallet or evidence locker) in their place.  \n•  When Storimon finally reaches for his property the officer hands it over, looking perfectly innocent.  Because the twenties are dry, no one notices that they could not have been in the puddle.  \n•  Only when Storimon leafs through it does he realise the hundreds are gone.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMick – Would have had to wade into the gutter wearing bulky mittens.  They would be muddy and soaked later, yet they are described as perfectly clean and dry.\n\nDanny – Arrives after the wallet is already in the street, has a broken arm in a cast (clumsy for opening a wet wallet) and never leaves the pavement.  No one sees him approach the curb and his single good hand is busy flicking his skateboard and opening gum while the wallet still lies where it fell.\n\nNarrator – Gives a first-person account that never includes touching the curb or the wallet and is visible to all the others while the officer is holding the wallet.\n\nCab driver – Drove off before the theft was discovered and before the wallet was recovered.\n\nOnly the policeman had motive, means and—crucially—the opportunity while actually holding the wallet to remove the $100-bills unnoticed.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

Then everyone stopped talking, and the bus stop was silent. \"My wallet was full of hundred dollar bills,\" Mr. Storimond said. \"Sometimes I'll flash one around when I'm telling the story of the company I founded.\" Then he held out a handful of green bills, and fanned them so we could see. \"All of my hundred dollar bills are gone.\" Sure enough, there were no hundreds or even fifties -- nothing but clean, crisp $20 dollar bills -- but not a $100 bill anywhere. \"This is your idea of a joke,\" he said angrily to the homeless man, \"because I told you I'd started my company with a hundred dollar bill.\" \"No way, dude,\" said Danny. \"How do we know the old guy's telling the truth?\" I told him I didn't think Mick would steal his money, but Mr. Storimon said angrily \"You were napping. You don't know what anyone was doing. You didn't wake up until after the kid on the skateboard got here. Even he could've stolen the money by the time you got your eyes open.\" \"I think the police officer did it,\" Mick said. \"While we were arguing, he lifted the hundreds for himself. Then he'd finally have an excuse to arrest the homeless guy.\" The old man stared, the skateboarder glared, and the police officer took a second bite of his chocolate-filled doughnut. Fortunately, I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

      "mystery_text": "Mick was the smartest guy in my neighborhood. Sure he was homeless, but Mick took that as proof of how smart he was. Hebragged that he never had to pay rent, and he never worried about paying car insurance. Every morning he'd sit at the bus stop and laugh at all the people who had to go to work. There was only one thing Mick was afraid of -- the police. There were laws against vagrancy, because, as Mick pointed out, \"People always assume homeless people will eventually rob them.\" We were standing at the bus stop, and the sun was just coming up. I'd missed the 8:30 bus, and I'd have to wait for the 8:50. But in the next 20 minutes, I'd also be solving a mystery. Mick was sitting on the bench at the bus stop, and it looked like he was actually humming. I thought he'd be cold and grumpy, but he'd bundled himself up in a spiffy spring outfit -- a brown scarf, a brown ski cap and thick brown mittens. I reminded myself that I'd have a warm apartment and a roof over my head tonight -- but it still seemed like Mick was happier than me. \"How long you going to be at work today?\" Mick asked enthusiastically. \"Eight hours,\" I said. \"Do you have to ask permission to leave your desk?\" he asked playfully. I looked down, trying to think up a good comeback, and Mick laughed delightedly. \"Hope it's worth it,\" he said. And that's when we saw Mr. Storimon. A cab was pulling up to the curb, but its door swung open before the cab had even reached the bus stop. Mr. Storimon exploded out of the door, trying to yank his wallet out of his pants pocket with one hand while pulling his expensive overcoat onto his shoulder with the other hand. He'd worked for 40 years at a bank downtown, but nobody really liked him. It was obvious he wanted respect after all that hard work -- but he treated people rudely, which made everyone be rude back to him. His white hair and pale skin almost matched the overcoat's color, and he looked like an angry snowman. \"How much?\" he barked at the cab driver, and when the cab driver said \"$19.90,\" Mr. Storimon gave him a twenty-dollar bill. (\"Not much of a tipper,\" Mick whispered to me with a laugh.) Storimon tried to slide the wallet back into his pocket, but apparently he missed. As he rushed to the bus stop, we heard it flop into a puddle on the street behind him . \"Let's see how long it takes before he notices,\" I said mischievously to Mick. It was even funnier when Mr. Storimon glared at Mick. \"No, I'm not giving you a handout.\" \"I'm not asking you for one,\" said Mick. \"You need to earn money.\" \"I've got money,\" said Mick. \"Well, then you need to learn how to hang onto it.\" \"So do you,\" I said. Mick and I laughed. Mr. Storimon glared, and I felt a little sorry for him as he muttered something obscene and then started reading the Wall Street Journal. \"People are funny,\" I whispered to Mick. Now I could see now why he enjoyed hanging out at the bus stop. I closed my eyes for a quick nap, but when I opened them someone else was at the bus stop. Wearing a loose Metallica shirt, a punk rocker had rolled up silently on his skateboard. I wondered what Mr. Storimon would do when he noticed... Danny's hair was cropped short, and he looked like he could be part of the band but he'd obviously been skateboarding for a while, because his face was covered with sweat. Maybe that's why he wanted to take the bus. When he got to its stop, Danny stepped off the skateboard and gave it a trick kick. It suddenly rose up off of the sidewalk, and Danny grabbed it without even bending over. He didn't say a word, but it was obvious he was trying to impress us. Mr. Storimon just rustled his newspaper. Danny didn't move -- he just stood there trying to look cool. In his own way, he seemed even lonelier than Mr. Storimon, and I felt sorry for him, too. Mick offered him a piece of gum. As Danny opened the gum and put it in his mouth, I noticed that his left hand was in a cast that went all the way to his elbow. For some reason, this made Mick laugh. \"He can't be that good of a skater,\" Mick whispered to me, \"if he's broken his left arm.\" Danny glared, then asked Mick \"Do you ever have any trouble with the cops?\" Mick nodded, and Danny said he understood. \"I'm always getting in trouble for skating where I shouldn't be. But skateboarding shouldn't be illegal. It's a form of exercise, just like riding your bike!\" \"You should both get a job,\" muttered Mr. Storimon. \"I started my first company with just a $100 dollar bill.\" But Mick didn't say anything. He had a scared look on his face, and he started looking around like he was trying to find someplace to hide. Looking up the street, I realized what had scared him. It was a police officer. He was eating an enormous doughnut, and he looked pretty happy, even if he wasn't smiling. There was a smudge of chocolate on his cheek, which almost matched the black uniform he was wearing. He looked over at the bus stop, like he was hoping none of the four of us were going to interrupt his breakfast. Mick looked down at the sidewalk and tried not to make eye contact. The police officer had just gobbled his first chocolate-filled bite of the shiny glazed doughnut, chewed for a moment, and then mumbled, \"Everything all right here?\" Danny didn't say anything, and I looked over at Mr. Storimon, who seemed thoroughly disinterested. \"Yes, everything's all right,\" he grumbled, reaching his hand into his pocket. And then suddenly, he realized his wallet was missing. \"No!\" Mr. Storimon shouted. \"Somebody's stolen my wallet!\" Mr. Storimon patted every one of his pockets, while his flustered white head looked in every direction. I smiled to myself, and was about to point out that he'd dropped his wallet --but the police officer insisted that everyone be quiet and asked if Mr. Storimon was sure that he'd had his wallet with him. \"Yes! I had it when I got out of the taxi!\" Mr. Storimon blustered. \"It's true,\" I said. \"I saw him pay the cab driver. But -- \" \"Maybe he stole it!\" Mr. Storimon shouted accusingly at Mick. \"I didn't!\" Mick insisted. But the police officer looked over curiously to where Mick and Danny were standing. \"Don't look at me, dude,\" Danny said quickly. \"Hold it!\" I said. \"The wallet's in the street! It fell out of his pocket when he got out of the cab, and nobody stole anything.\" Everyone was quiet for a second, until the police officer strolled over to the puddle by the curb and found the \"missing\" wallet. \"Is this yours?\" he said to Mr. Storimon, holding up the wallet. Mick started laughing, which made Mr. Storimon's white face turn red. \"We all saw you drop it. And then you told me I should hold on to my money. Whenever anything's missing, they always want to blame the homeless guy.\" \"Or the skater punk,\" added Danny. \"No one's blaming anybody,\" Mr. Storimon said. Soon everyone at the bus stop was engaged in a furious debate about the city's law enforcement policies. It took a couple of minutes before the police officer could get Mr. Storimon to stop arguing long enough to take the wallet out of the police officer's hand. \"If city ordinance number 213 had passed on the April ballot...\" Danny was screaming. \"Hold it!\" shouted Mr. Storimon. \"My money's missing!\" \"What?\" said the four of us -- all speaking at exactly the same time.
