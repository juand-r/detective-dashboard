    "full_text": "Detective Cheryl Barnes shook her head at her partner, Robert Simmons. “I can't smell a thing.” “Great,” he replied. “Your allergies act up on the day we investigate a robbery at a perfume company.” The pair drove into the parking lot of Rosewood Perfumes. Robert took a look around while Cheryl talked to the owner, Mr. Walters, a short man with a sad expression on his face. He wore a tie with a four-leaf clover and rubbed a rabbit’s foot with one of his hands. “I’m so glad you’re here,” the man said softly. “How much money was stolen?” asked Cheryl. “None.” “None? But you called in a robbery.” “They stole something more valuable -- perfume.” “Oh? How many bottles?” “One vial.” Cheryl stared at the man, wondering whether he was sane. “That’s it? Maybe you could explain a little bit?” “I can’t. I’m too upset. I’d suggest you talk to my secretary, Betty.” Cheryl nodded and walked over to Betty Simpson’s desk. Betty appeared a moment later with a donut and coffee. Cheryl noticed that she was middle-aged and walked with a limp. “I feel so sorry for Mr. Walters,” Betty said. He’s such a nice man. I had trouble finding a job a few years back, and even though I didn’t have any experience, Mr. Walters made me his secretary.” “Does he always carry a rabbit’s foot?” “Yes, he’s very superstitious. Up on his wall, he has two horseshoes. Before he starts each day, he rubs both of them.” “Maybe you can tell me a bit more about the stolen vial.” “I don’t know too much. But Mr. Walters and the staff have been working on a special perfume. This morning, a vial of it went missing. He doesn’t want to believe that a staff member took it. He thinks of us as family.” Cheryl nodded. “When was the missing vial noticed?” “When I came in -- around eight o’clock -- I heard everyone talking about it. “What time did you leave last night?” “Around six.” “When does Mr. Walters go home for the day?” “Normally, the same time as me. But last night, he had an appointment to see Mr. Danby at eight.” “Oh?” Cheryl removed a pad from her pocket and wrote the name down. “Who is he?” “A competitor in the perfume industry.” “A competitor? Why would Mr. Walters want to speak to him?” “They have a friendly rivalry. Every few months or so, Mr. Danby comes by to boast about his new product line or find out about ours. He runs a super-successful company himself. Cheryl nodded, then wrote something down on her pad. “If I wanted to find out more about your new perfume, whom would I speak with?” “Darlene. She’s Mr. Walters' assistant.” A few moments later, Cheryl entered the laboratory and stood next to Darlene Herman, a tall, broad-shouldered woman. “Can you tell me about your latest project?” Cheryl asked. “Certainly.” Darlene pointed to the glass vials sitting on a wall shelf, numbered from one to twenty. “They contain samples of our newest scent: Intrigue.” Cheryl removed one of the perfume vials and examined it closely. “They look like they're full of water.” “Yes, but they actually contain pheromones” “Pheromones?” asked Cheryl. “Those are the chemicals that make us more attractive to the opposite sex.” “Interesting.” “It's going to triple our sales.” Darlene smiled ear to ear. “You seem very excited about it. Do you get a percentage if it’s successful?” “No, unfortunately not. But Mr. Walters said because of all the hard work I’d put in, he’d give me a promotion once it reaches the market.” “Was it you who noticed that a vial was missing?” “Yes. Due to Mr. Walters’ superstitious nature, we always make sure that there are two number fourteens and no number thirteen. But now there’s a thirteen and only one fourteen. That’s how I knew something was wrong.” “So someone took one out and switched another in?” “Yes, from those empty vials over there.” Darlene pointed to several vials on the table. Cheryl made another note on her pad. “Is there anyone else I can talk to?” Darlene thought a moment. “Perhaps, the janitor. That’s Mr. Harrison. He might have seen something.” A few moments later, Cheryl spoke to the curly-haired janitor. He was a tall man who wore thick, black eye glasses. “How long have you been working here, Mr. Harrison?” “Just a short time. They hired me a few days ago. But I've already given my notice.” Cheryl raised her eyebrows. “So soon?” “Yes. I've heard they've had several janitors leave. It's not a friendly place.” The janitor shook his head. “It’s unbelievable. I'm a professional. They don’t have to tell me what to do. These people make their money the easy way … a desk job. I have to work like a horse.” “I see. What time did you begin cleaning the lab floor last night?” “About 7:30 p.m.” “Did you see Mr. Walters?” Cheryl asked. “Yeah. Just as I went into the lab, he left. I didn't say anything to him and he didn't say anything to me.” “Thank you. That's all I need to know.” The janitor grunted and left the office. Cheryl walked out into the hall and called her partner over. “I think I know who stole the vial.” “You do?” She nodded. “Even with allergies, I can still sniff out a thief.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What had to be done to commit the crime?\n   • Know exactly which vial to take (one of the two “#14” samples of the new perfume).\n   • Realise that if a vial simply disappeared, anyone doing a quick count would see only 19 vials, so the absence would be obvious.\n   • Put another vial in the empty space so the total would still be 20 – but choose a number the owner would never allow (“13”) so that everyone would immediately notice “something is wrong” without suspecting someone who understood Mr Walters’s superstition.\n\n2. Who was able to do that?\n   • Only someone who (a) works in the laboratory, (b) knows Mr Walters refuses to have a #13 on the shelf, and (c) has easy after-hours access to the vials.\n     – Janitor Harrison is new, had never worked in the lab before that evening, and even complains he is treated “like a horse”.  He could not have known about the duplicate #14 or Mr Walters’s dislike of #13.\n     – Betty Simpson is merely the office secretary, not a lab worker, and she left at 6 p.m.\n     – Mr Walters himself would never bring a #13 into the lab; it offends his own superstition.\n     – Darlene Herman, the research assistant, is the only person who fits all three requirements.\n\n3. Motive\n   • Darlene says she will receive merely “a promotion” if the perfume is successful, but she could earn a fortune by selling a sample to the highly successful competitor, Mr Danby, who happened to be meeting Mr Walters that very night.\n   • By reporting the missing vial first thing in the morning, she diverts suspicion and forces the police to look outward, not at an insider.\n\n4. Opportunity\n   • After the staff left at 6 p.m., Darlene could stay in the lab as long as she wished.  Mr Walters was there until about 7 : 30, but she could claim to be finishing up; when he finally left for his 8 p.m. meeting she had the lab and the vials entirely to herself.  The janitor did not enter until 7 : 30, and he saw Walters leave – not Darlene.\n\n5. Physical/behavioural clues\n   • The thief deliberately inserted a #13 vial – something no outsider would think of and Mr Walters would never tolerate.  Only Darlene would dare use “13” and also know where an empty #13-labelled vial lay.\n   • She is the one who “discovered” the theft and immediately suggested talking to the janitor, the one person least likely to know the superstition – a classic attempt to deflect blame.\n   • Her enthusiasm for “tripling sales” while receiving no royalties gives her a financial reason to steal and sell the formula herself.\n\n6. Conclusion\n   The only person with the necessary knowledge, the opportunity and a convincing motive is Darlene Herman.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDarlene Herman, Mr. Walters, Betty Simpson, Mr. Harrison, Mr. Danby\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nDarlene Herman\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone (the sample was probably intended for Mr Danby, but he had not yet received it and cannot be proven an accomplice at this stage)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Wednesday evening, after most workers left at 6 p.m., Darlene stayed in the laboratory on the pretext of finishing up.\n• Mr Walters remained in the building until roughly 7 : 30, then left the lab to meet competitor James Danby at 8 p.m.\n• The moment Walters walked out, Darlene removed one of the two “#14” vials containing the prototype perfume “Intrigue”.\n• To keep the shelf looking full she picked up an empty vial labelled “13” (one of those kept for general use) and set it among the others, leaving still 20 vials but now numbered 1-12, 13, 14, 15-20.\n• She locked the stolen vial in her handbag, planning to sell or trade it to Danby later.\n• The janitor, who entered the lab at 7 : 30, merely saw Mr Walters depart and noticed nothing amiss.\n• Next morning Darlene “discovered” the problem, loudly announcing that someone must have broken in and switched the vials, and hinted that a newcomer (the janitor) might be responsible.\n• Detective Cheryl Barnes realised that only a person who knew of Mr Walters’s superstition—and therefore of the absence of #13 and duplication of #14—could have engineered such a switch, and that Mr Walters himself would never bring a #13 into the lab.  That left Darlene.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mr. Walters – The owner is violently superstitious about the number 13; he would hardly introduce the forbidden number into his own lab.  Moreover he had every reason to protect, not steal, his crown-jewel formula.\n• Betty Simpson – She is an office secretary with no laboratory access after hours and left the building at 6 p.m.  Nothing places her back inside later.\n• Mr. Harrison (janitor) – Newly hired, he did not know of the duplicate #14 or the avoidance of #13 and could not have planned so precise a deception within minutes of starting his first evening shift.  His thick glasses and general ignorance of the company’s rituals back up his statement.\n• Mr. Danby – The competitor was only scheduled for a friendly visit at 8 p.m.  There is no evidence he entered the laboratory or met Darlene that night.  Without proof he remains merely the intended recipient, not an accomplice.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It would have been very easy for her to take one out and switch another in.”\nCheryl shook her head. “No way. She knew all about Mr. Walters’ superstitions. She definitely wouldn’t have written the number thirteen on any of the vials.”\nRobert scratched his head. “I’ve got it. The mysterious Mr. Danby. He could have gone to the lab after his meeting with Walters.”\n“I don’t think so. He has no motive. He’s already so successful.”\nRobert sighed, “I give up.”\nCheryl smiled. “Mr. Harrison is the thief.”\n“Harrison? How do you figure that?”\n“Everyone else knew about Mr. Walters’ superstitious nature except him -- he’d just been hired and no one talked to him. He grabbed the fourteenth vial, not realizing there were two fourteens. Then he looked at the rest of the vials and it appeared number thirteen was missing. So he grabbed an empty one, filled it with water and wrote thirteen on it. Then he placed it with the other vials.”\nRobert stared at her for a moment, then laughed. “Maybe I’d be able to solve more crimes if I had allergies too.”"
