    "full_text": "As Roger headed into the zoo office, he ran into Leonard, a tall man with blond hair. Roger liked Leonard, but sometimes, he went overboard with his practical jokes. He remembered Leonard’s last prank very well. He had snuck Roger’s cowboy hat into the chimpanzee cage. Then Harriet, one of the two chimpanzees, had put it on her head and wouldn’t take it off. Everyone in the crowd that day started laughing. Roger was angry at first but eventually laughed too. “I hope there are no practical jokes today, Leonard,” Roger said. Leonard’s eyes twinkled and then he shrugged. Roger didn’t know what to make of that, but he did know that at least his new hat was safe. Leonard never repeated the same practical joke twice. He said goodbye to Leonard, then walked into the main zoo building. Seated on the bench in front of his office were three students wearing nametags. Roger then remembered that the Zoo manager had asked him to show the students around and figure out who would be the best employee for the summer. The zoo could only afford one of them. Roger was happy to do it as he knew the qualities that the zoo needed. They wanted someone who was knowledgeable, co-operative and loved animals. “Hello, everyone,” Roger said. “Today we’re going to feed a couple of the animals and the four of us will get to know one another. That way I can tell who is most suited to the job.” Tom, a husky boy, sighed. “I hope we’re going to finish this fast, I have to go to a baseball game.” “It’ll take about an hour. “What time’s your game?” “About four,” Tom said. “Should be okay, unless we go into extra innings,” Roger smiled. Roger’s eyes wandered over to the other two students. “You guys care what time we finish?” Cindy shook her head. “No, I don’t have to give blood till seven and I can do my volunteer work at the Church after that.” Tom looked at Cindy. “What are you some kind of saint?” “Just trying to do my part.” Tom grunted. “How about you, Henry?” Roger asked. “I, uh, well...” he said, his right shoulder twitching. “...everything is fine.” The four of them left the building and headed toward the animal cages. The first cage housed the Cockatoo. “This is Wally,” said Roger. He opened a door beside the cage and led the students into a room with a small fridge. Roger had Henry open the fridge and remove a plate of cut fruit and some birdseed. Henry’s hands shook and he accidentally dropped a bit of fruit on the ground. He turned all red. “I’m sorry.” He said. “You’re not going to yell at me are you? I can’t stand being yelled at.” “No, no. Don’t worry, Henry, I drop things too.” Henry nodded then gave the plate to Roger. The students then followed Roger through the door into the feeding area. Cindy moved close to the large white bird. “Hi Wally, what’s up?” Tom stared at Cindy. “I can’t believe you’re talking to that bird. He doesn’t know what you’re saying.” “For your information, Cockatoos are very intelligent. I read they’re as smart as a three year old.” Roger grinned. “That’s right, very good Cindy.” After the Cockatoo had been fed, the three of them ambled over to the elephant cage. “This is Sally,” Roger said. Then he took everyone into the room beside the cage. “Tom can you take that big container of food from the fridge.” Tom shook his head. “I’m not carrying that, it weighs a ton,” “I’ll do it,” said Cindy. The container wobbled in her hands for a moment, but then she was able to hold it steady. “This is going to give me strong muscles for sure.” Henry reached inside the fridge to get the elephant’s desert -- a cantaloupe but it dropped onto the ground. As he picked it up, his body started to quiver. “I’m sorry, please don’t yell.” “Don’t worry so much Henry. Everything is okay.” Cindy handed the food container to Roger and Henry gave him the cantaloupe. Roger and the students then entered the elephants feeding area. “I think elephants are the stupidest animals,” said Tom. “They have that ridiculous trunk and a real dumb expression on their face.” “Actually, they’re very smart,” said Cindy. “They’re the only animal that mourns when one of the other elephants dies.” Roger nodded. “Yes, you’re right once again Cindy. You must study a lot.” “I love animals and like to know everything about them.” Once the elephants were fed, Roger and the three students walked over to the chimpanzee area. “This is Harriet and Charlie,” Roger said as he led the students into the room beside the cage. Then Roger had Henry remove the plate of food from the fridge. This time, Henry didn’t drop a thing. “Good Work, Henry.” “Thanks.” Roger was about to take the plate into the feeding area when he remembered his hat. He was worried that one of the chimps might take it. He didn’t want to lose another hat so he put it on the top of the fridge. Then he took the plate from Henry and went into the feeding area with the students. Harriet had been swinging on a small trapeze in the cage. But when she spotted Roger she raced over to him, still wearing his hat.” Tom shook his head. “I bet she doesn’t have a brain in her head.” “You’re wrong,” said Cindy. “Chimpanzee’s are the only animals that can make tools.” Tom started to laugh. “Tools? What’s he do, make a hammer?” “No, they sharpen sticks so that they can get the ants out of the dirt and eat them.” “That’s disgusting.” Cindy turned to look at Charlie. “He looks so sad. I think he’s upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.” As soon as they exited the feeding area, Roger felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Leonard. “Hey Len. Everyone this is Leonard. He’s another zoo keeper.” All the students said hi except Tom, who looked at his watch. “Hey it’s three thirty. Are we going to be finished soon?” “Yeah, I think that’s it for today.” Roger went to get the hat that he’d left on the fridge. But it wasn’t there. Suddenly, he heard screams of laughter from Leonard and the students. When he looked back at the monkey cage, he saw the two chimps holding hands and both wearing cowboy hats. He had to giggle, but at the same time he needed to know who had done it -- one of the students or Leonard. If it was Leonard that was one thing, but if it was one of the kids...well Roger didn’t want to hire someone who was another practical joker. One was enough. “So anyone want to tell me who put my hat in the monkey cage?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Leonard is a famous prankster, but Roger himself tells us that “Leonard never repeated the same practical joke twice.”  \n     Putting a cowboy hat into the chimp cage would be the exact same joke as last time, so it is something Leonard is on record as not doing again.  \n   • Tom clearly dislikes animals and is in a hurry to leave; his remarks show no wish to please the chimps.  \n   • Henry is frightened of doing anything wrong and keeps apologising; staging a prank that would certainly be noticed is the last thing he’d risk.  \n   • Cindy loves animals and, inside the chimp enclosure, she actually says:  \n     “He looks so sad. I think he’s upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.”  \n     That is an explicit desire to see Charlie get a hat. She therefore has a positive motive to give him Roger’s spare hat.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   • Roger puts the new cowboy hat on top of the fridge in the preparation room.  \n   • At that moment all three students are next to him; Leonard is not present.  \n   • Roger immediately takes the food plate and, with the students, goes through the doorway into the feeding area. While they are passing through the doorway Roger is walking first, concentrating on the plate and on Harriet, who comes racing over. Anyone walking behind him has several unobstructed seconds in which to lift the hat from the fridge and slip it under a shirt or behind the plate.  \n   • Inside the feeding area Roger’s attention is still on Harriet; Tom is insulting the animals; Henry is trying not to be shouted at. Cindy is the only one standing close enough to Charlie to speak about him. She could easily pass the concealed hat through the bars or simply place it on the floor where Charlie could pick it up.  \n   • When they all file back out, the hat is no longer on the fridge. Leonard appears only after they have left the preparation room, so he never had access to the hat.\n\n3. Physical evidence / timing  \n   • Roger discovers the loss the very moment he tries to reclaim the hat; therefore the theft occurred during the brief interval in which only Roger and the three students were in the preparation room and then in the cage.  \n   • Leonard could not have known there was a second cowboy hat in that room; only the students saw Roger park it there.  \n   • Cindy’s remark about Charlie’s sadness is a classic “verbal clue” that telegraphs what she is about to do.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   • Only someone who was in the preparation room when Roger left the hat could steal it.  \n   • Only someone who was in the feeding area while Roger’s back was turned could hand it to Charlie.  \n   • Among those persons, only Cindy had any motive, and her words show foreknowledge of the exact prank that was about to be revealed.  \n   • Therefore Cindy is the only plausible culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLeonard, Tom, Henry, Cindy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCindy\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Roger placed his new cowboy hat on top of the fridge.  \n• As he turned away, Cindy quietly lifted the hat and hid it under her arm or inside the food container.  \n• Inside the feeding area Roger concentrated on Harriet, Tom was complaining, and Henry worried about being scolded. Cindy stepped close to Charlie and, while everyone’s attention was elsewhere, slipped the hat through the bars or placed it on Charlie’s head herself.  \n• They all left the cage. The hat, of course, was no longer on the fridge.  \n• Leonard arrived just in time to see the sight of both chimps wearing hats and burst out laughing with the students.  \n• When Roger looked for the hat it was gone, and Charlie was proudly wearing it—thanks to Cindy’s well-meant but unauthorized prank.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Leonard: Known for never repeating a prank; had no knowledge the hat was left on the fridge and no opportunity because he did not enter the room until after the group had left it.  \n• Tom: Dislikes the animals, is in a hurry to reach his baseball game, and shows no desire to entertain the chimps. He had opportunity but no motive, and nothing he said suggests foreknowledge of the trick.  \n• Henry: Timid, afraid of being yelled at, and focused on not dropping anything. His nervous nature and lack of motive make it extremely unlikely he would risk a prank certain to draw attention.  \n• Cindy: Only person with a friendly motive toward the chimps and the only one whose words foreshadow the exact prank. Hence she—and only she—fits all the clues.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Roger and the students then entered the elephants feeding area. “I think elephants are the stupidest animals,” said Tom. “They have that ridiculous trunk and a real dumb expression on their face.” “Actually, they’re very smart,” said Cindy. “They’re the only animal that mourns when one of the other elephants dies.” Roger nodded. “Yes, you’re right once again Cindy. You must study a lot.” “I love animals and like to know everything about them.” Once the elephants were fed, Roger and the three students walked over to the chimpanzee area. “This is Harriet and Charlie,” Roger said as he led the students into the room beside the cage. Then Roger had Henry remove the plate of food from the fridge. This time, Henry didn’t drop a thing. “Good Work, Henry.” “Thanks.” Roger was about to take the plate into the feeding area when he remembered his hat. He was worried that one of the chimps might take it. He didn’t want to lose another hat so he put it on the top of the fridge. Then he took the plate from Henry and went into the feeding area with the students. Harriet had been swinging on a small trapeze in the cage. But when she spotted Roger she raced over to him, still wearing his hat.” Tom shook his head. “I bet she doesn’t have a brain in her head.” “You’re wrong,” said Cindy. “Chimpanzee’s are the only animals that can make tools.” Tom started to laugh. “Tools? What’s he do, make a hammer?” “No, they sharpen sticks so that they can get the ants out of the dirt and eat them.” “That’s disgusting.” Cindy turned to look at Charlie. “He looks so sad. I think he’s upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.” As soon as they exited the feeding area, Roger felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Leonard. “Hey Len. Everyone this is Leonard. He’s another zoo keeper.” All the students said hi except Tom, who looked at his watch. “Hey it’s three thirty. Are we going to be finished soon?” “Yeah, I think that’s it for today.” Roger went to get the hat that he’d left on the fridge. But it wasn’t there. Suddenly, he heard screams of laughter from Leonard and the students. When he looked back at the monkey cage, he saw the two chimps holding hands and both wearing cowboy hats. He had to giggle, but at the same time he needed to know who had done it -- one of the students or Leonard. If it was Leonard that was one thing, but if it was one of the kids...well Roger didn’t want to hire someone who was another practical joker. One was enough. “So anyone want to tell me who put my hat in the monkey cage?”",

      "answer": "(a) Cindy",
      "outcome": "Leonard laughed. “It’s funny. But I didn’t do it.”\nRoger nodded. “I figured it wasn’t you, Leonard. I know you never repeat the same practical joke twice.”\nHenry spoke up next. “I didn’t do it either.”\n“I didn’t think so, Henry. You were so worried I was going to yell at you, I know you wouldn’t have wanted to upset me.”\nHenry nodded.\nRoger stared at Tom. “I know you weren’t behind this.”\n“You did? How?”\n“You had a game to go to and wouldn’t have wanted anything to tie you up.”\nRoger finally looked at Cindy. “It was you, wasn’t it?”\nCindy lowered her head. “I’m sorry.”\n“But you had a good reason, didn’t you?”\nCindy nodded. “Yeah.”\nRoger smiled. “I bet it’s because you love animals and you thought Charlie was jealous because his mate had a hat. Is that right?”\n“I could see it in his eyes.”\nLater that day, Roger gave his recommendation for the summer job. It was Cindy. She was knowledgeable, co-operative, and obviously loved animals."
