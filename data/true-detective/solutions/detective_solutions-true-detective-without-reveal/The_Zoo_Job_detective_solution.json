    "full_text": "As Roger headed into the zoo office, he ran into Leonard, a tall man with blond hair. Roger liked Leonard, but sometimes, he went overboard with his practical jokes. He remembered Leonard’s last prank very well. He had snuck Roger’s cowboy hat into the chimpanzee cage. Then Harriet, one of the two chimpanzees, had put it on her head and wouldn’t take it off. Everyone in the crowd that day started laughing. Roger was angry at first but eventually laughed too. “I hope there are no practical jokes today, Leonard,” Roger said. Leonard’s eyes twinkled and then he shrugged. Roger didn’t know what to make of that, but he did know that at least his new hat was safe. Leonard never repeated the same practical joke twice. He said goodbye to Leonard, then walked into the main zoo building. Seated on the bench in front of his office were three students wearing nametags. Roger then remembered that the Zoo manager had asked him to show the students around and figure out who would be the best employee for the summer. The zoo could only afford one of them. Roger was happy to do it as he knew the qualities that the zoo needed. They wanted someone who was knowledgeable, co-operative and loved animals. “Hello, everyone,” Roger said. “Today we’re going to feed a couple of the animals and the four of us will get to know one another. That way I can tell who is most suited to the job.” Tom, a husky boy, sighed. “I hope we’re going to finish this fast, I have to go to a baseball game.” “It’ll take about an hour. “What time’s your game?” “About four,” Tom said. “Should be okay, unless we go into extra innings,” Roger smiled. Roger’s eyes wandered over to the other two students. “You guys care what time we finish?” Cindy shook her head. “No, I don’t have to give blood till seven and I can do my volunteer work at the Church after that.” Tom looked at Cindy. “What are you some kind of saint?” “Just trying to do my part.” Tom grunted. “How about you, Henry?” Roger asked. “I, uh, well...” he said, his right shoulder twitching. “...everything is fine.” The four of them left the building and headed toward the animal cages. The first cage housed the Cockatoo. “This is Wally,” said Roger. He opened a door beside the cage and led the students into a room with a small fridge. Roger had Henry open the fridge and remove a plate of cut fruit and some birdseed. Henry’s hands shook and he accidentally dropped a bit of fruit on the ground. He turned all red. “I’m sorry.” He said. “You’re not going to yell at me are you? I can’t stand being yelled at.” “No, no. Don’t worry, Henry, I drop things too.” Henry nodded then gave the plate to Roger. The students then followed Roger through the door into the feeding area. Cindy moved close to the large white bird. “Hi Wally, what’s up?” Tom stared at Cindy. “I can’t believe you’re talking to that bird. He doesn’t know what you’re saying.” “For your information, Cockatoos are very intelligent. I read they’re as smart as a three year old.” Roger grinned. “That’s right, very good Cindy.” After the Cockatoo had been fed, the three of them ambled over to the elephant cage. “This is Sally,” Roger said. Then he took everyone into the room beside the cage. “Tom can you take that big container of food from the fridge.” Tom shook his head. “I’m not carrying that, it weighs a ton,” “I’ll do it,” said Cindy. The container wobbled in her hands for a moment, but then she was able to hold it steady. “This is going to give me strong muscles for sure.” Henry reached inside the fridge to get the elephant’s desert -- a cantaloupe but it dropped onto the ground. As he picked it up, his body started to quiver. “I’m sorry, please don’t yell.” “Don’t worry so much Henry. Everything is okay.” Cindy handed the food container to Roger and Henry gave him the cantaloupe. Roger and the students then entered the elephants feeding area. “I think elephants are the stupidest animals,” said Tom. “They have that ridiculous trunk and a real dumb expression on their face.” “Actually, they’re very smart,” said Cindy. “They’re the only animal that mourns when one of the other elephants dies.” Roger nodded. “Yes, you’re right once again Cindy. You must study a lot.” “I love animals and like to know everything about them.” Once the elephants were fed, Roger and the three students walked over to the chimpanzee area. “This is Harriet and Charlie,” Roger said as he led the students into the room beside the cage. Then Roger had Henry remove the plate of food from the fridge. This time, Henry didn’t drop a thing. “Good Work, Henry.” “Thanks.” Roger was about to take the plate into the feeding area when he remembered his hat. He was worried that one of the chimps might take it. He didn’t want to lose another hat so he put it on the top of the fridge. Then he took the plate from Henry and went into the feeding area with the students. Harriet had been swinging on a small trapeze in the cage. But when she spotted Roger she raced over to him, still wearing his hat.” Tom shook his head. “I bet she doesn’t have a brain in her head.” “You’re wrong,” said Cindy. “Chimpanzee’s are the only animals that can make tools.” Tom started to laugh. “Tools? What’s he do, make a hammer?” “No, they sharpen sticks so that they can get the ants out of the dirt and eat them.” “That’s disgusting.” Cindy turned to look at Charlie. “He looks so sad. I think he’s upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.” As soon as they exited the feeding area, Roger felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Leonard. “Hey Len. Everyone this is Leonard. He’s another zoo keeper.” All the students said hi except Tom, who looked at his watch. “Hey it’s three thirty. Are we going to be finished soon?” “Yeah, I think that’s it for today.” Roger went to get the hat that he’d left on the fridge. But it wasn’t there. Suddenly, he heard screams of laughter from Leonard and the students. When he looked back at the monkey cage, he saw the two chimps holding hands and both wearing cowboy hats. He had to giggle, but at the same time he needed to know who had done it -- one of the students or Leonard. If it was Leonard that was one thing, but if it was one of the kids...well Roger didn’t want to hire someone who was another practical joker. One was enough. “So anyone want to tell me who put my hat in the monkey cage?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the moment the hat disappeared  \n   • Roger puts the NEW cowboy-hat on top of the fridge in the preparation room of the chimpanzee enclosure.  \n   • Immediately afterwards he leads the three students into the feeding area and is inside the cage for several minutes.  \n   • When he comes back out the hat is gone.\n\n   Therefore the hat must have been taken in the short interval between Roger’s turning toward the feeding door and the moment the last person left the preparation room.  \n   No one outside the four people who were then present (Roger, Tom, Cindy, Henry) could have touched it in that instant.\n\n2. Consider motive clues given earlier in the story  \n   • Tom openly says he finds animals “stupid” and is impatient to leave for his ball game – no motive to make a chimp happy.  \n   • Henry is terrified of being yelled at; he is nervous and wants to avoid trouble – the last person to risk a prank.  \n   • Cindy repeatedly shows affection for the animals and specific sympathy for Charlie:  \n        – With the cockatoo: “Hi, Wally, what’s up?”  \n        – With the elephant she volunteers to carry the heavy bucket.  \n        – With the chimps she actually says, “He looks so sad. I think he’s upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.”  \n      This is an explicit statement of a motive: give Charlie a hat so he will not feel left out.\n\n   • Leonard loves practical jokes, but he insists he never repeats the same gag twice and Roger believes him.  Today’s scene would be an exact repeat of the old cowboy-hat-in-the-chimp-cage joke, which Leonard himself has said he never does.\n\n3. Opportunity analysis  \n   • Leonard was not in the preparation room when Roger set the hat down; he appears only after everyone has come back out.  He could not have reached through a locked cage to crown Charlie without a key and without the inside group seeing him.  \n   • Tom and Henry were each holding nothing after Henry handed the plate to Roger; they walked directly behind Roger into the cage.  They had no free moment next to the fridge.  \n   • Cindy was standing closest to the fridge (she had not handled the plate), had both hands free, and was the last to pass through the doorway.  While Roger’s back was turned she could simply pick up the hat and carry it into the cage under her arm or behind her back.\n\n4. How the hat got on Charlie’s head  \n   Inside the cage Cindy lingered behind the others.  While Roger and Tom were busy watching Harriet, Cindy quietly popped the spare hat on Charlie’s head—exactly what she had said would make him feel better—then followed the others out.  Nobody noticed until they had left the enclosure.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n   Motive (make Charlie happy) + sole convenient opportunity (right beside the fridge, hands free, last to enter, openly thinking about giving Charlie a hat) points unequivocally to Cindy.  Leonard’s supposed “signature” prank is a red-herring; it is being imitated, not repeated by him.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLeonard the keeper, Tom, Henry, Cindy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCindy\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen Roger paused at the fridge and set his new cowboy hat on top, Cindy—standing nearest and with her hands free—picked it up the instant his back was turned.  She tucked the hat out of sight and followed the others into the chimpanzee enclosure.  Remembering her own remark that Charlie “looked sad” without a hat, she slipped the cowboy hat onto Charlie’s head while Roger and the others were focussed on Harriet.  \nAfter feeding was finished everyone filed out.  A moment later Roger tried to retrieve his hat, discovered it missing, and turned to see both chimps now proudly wearing cowboy hats—Harriet still in the old one, Charlie in the new one.  Leonard’s timely arrival and laughter made the scene look like another of his pranks, but in fact Cindy had carried it out to cheer up the animal.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Leonard – Was nowhere near the fridge when the hat vanished, would have had to repeat exactly the same joke he claims never to repeat, and would have needed to open the cage in full view of the people inside it.  \n• Tom – Showed no affection for the animals, was impatient to leave and gave no sign of being near the hat; no motive.  \n• Henry – Too nervous to risk mischief and was occupied handing the food plate to Roger at the critical moment; again no motive.  \nTherefore only Cindy possessed motive, means, and opportunity.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

The first cage housed the Cockatoo. “This is Wally,” said Roger. He opened a door beside the cage and led the students into a room with a small fridge. Roger had Henry open the fridge and remove a plate of cut fruit and some birdseed. Henry’s hands shook and he accidentally dropped a bit of fruit on the ground. He turned all red. “I’m sorry.” He said. “You’re not going to yell at me are you? I can’t stand being yelled at.” “No, no. Don’t worry, Henry, I drop things too.” Henry nodded then gave the plate to Roger. The students then followed Roger through the door into the feeding area. Cindy moved close to the large white bird. “Hi Wally, what’s up?” Tom stared at Cindy. “I can’t believe you’re talking to that bird. He doesn’t know what you’re saying.” “For your information, Cockatoos are very intelligent. I read they’re as smart as a three year old.” Roger grinned. “That’s right, very good Cindy.” After the Cockatoo had been fed, the three of them ambled over to the elephant cage. “This is Sally,” Roger said. Then he took everyone into the room beside the cage. “Tom can you take that big container of food from the fridge.” Tom shook his head. “I’m not carrying that, it weighs a ton,” “I’ll do it,” said Cindy. The container wobbled in her hands for a moment, but then she was able to hold it steady. “This is going to give me strong muscles for sure.” Henry reached inside the fridge to get the elephant’s desert -- a cantaloupe but it dropped onto the ground.

Everything is okay.” Cindy handed the food container to Roger and Henry gave him the cantaloupe.

You must study a lot.” “I love animals and like to know everything about them.” Once the elephants were fed, Roger and the three students walked over to the chimpanzee area. “This is Harriet and Charlie,” Roger said as he led the students into the room beside the cage.

He’s another zoo keeper.” All the students said hi except Tom, who looked at his watch. “Hey it’s three thirty. Are we going to be finished soon?” “Yeah, I think that’s it for today.” Roger went to get the hat that he’d left on the fridge. But it wasn’t there. Suddenly, he heard screams of laughter from Leonard and the students. When he looked back at the monkey cage, he saw the two chimps holding hands and both wearing cowboy hats.

As he picked it up, his body started to quiver. “I’m sorry, please don’t yell.” “Don’t worry so much Henry. Everything is okay.” Cindy handed the food container to Roger and Henry gave him the cantaloupe. Roger and the students then entered the elephants feeding area. “I think elephants are the stupidest animals,” said Tom. “They have that ridiculous trunk and a real dumb expression on their face.” “Actually, they’re very smart,” said Cindy. “They’re the only animal that mourns when one of the other elephants dies.” Roger nodded. “Yes, you’re right once again Cindy. You must study a lot.” “I love animals and like to know everything about them.” Once the elephants were fed, Roger and the three students walked over to the chimpanzee area. “This is Harriet and Charlie,” Roger said as he led the students into the room beside the cage. Then Roger had Henry remove the plate of food from the fridge. This time, Henry didn’t drop a thing. “Good Work, Henry.” “Thanks.” Roger was about to take the plate into the feeding area when he remembered his hat. He was worried that one of the chimps might take it. He didn’t want to lose another hat so he put it on the top of the fridge. Then he took the plate from Henry and went into the feeding area with the students. Harriet had been swinging on a small trapeze in the cage. But when she spotted Roger she raced over to him, still wearing his hat.” Tom shook his head. “I bet she doesn’t have a brain in her head.” “You’re wrong,” said Cindy. “Chimpanzee’s are the only animals that can make tools.” Tom started to laugh. “Tools? What’s he do, make a hammer?” “No, they sharpen sticks so that they can get the ants out of the dirt and eat them.” “That’s disgusting.” Cindy turned to look at Charlie. “He looks so sad. I think he’s upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.” As soon as they exited the feeding area, Roger felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Leonard. “Hey Len. Everyone this is Leonard. He’s another zoo keeper.” All the students said hi except Tom, who looked at his watch. “Hey it’s three thirty. Are we going to be finished soon?” “Yeah, I think that’s it for today.” Roger went to get the hat that he’d left on the fridge. But it wasn’t there. Suddenly, he heard screams of laughter from Leonard and the students. When he looked back at the monkey cage, he saw the two chimps holding hands and both wearing cowboy hats. He had to giggle, but at the same time he needed to know who had done it -- one of the students or Leonard. If it was Leonard that was one thing, but if it was one of the kids...well Roger didn’t want to hire someone who was another practical joker. One was enough. “So anyone want to tell me who put my hat in the monkey cage?”",

      "answer": "(a) Cindy",
      "outcome": "Leonard laughed. “It’s funny. But I didn’t do it.”\nRoger nodded. “I figured it wasn’t you, Leonard. I know you never repeat the same practical joke twice.”\nHenry spoke up next. “I didn’t do it either.”\n“I didn’t think so, Henry. You were so worried I was going to yell at you, I know you wouldn’t have wanted to upset me.”\nHenry nodded.\nRoger stared at Tom. “I know you weren’t behind this.”\n“You did? How?”\n“You had a game to go to and wouldn’t have wanted anything to tie you up.”\nRoger finally looked at Cindy. “It was you, wasn’t it?”\nCindy lowered her head. “I’m sorry.”\n“But you had a good reason, didn’t you?”\nCindy nodded. “Yeah.”\nRoger smiled. “I bet it’s because you love animals and you thought Charlie was jealous because his mate had a hat. Is that right?”\n“I could see it in his eyes.”\nLater that day, Roger gave his recommendation for the summer job. It was Cindy. She was knowledgeable, co-operative, and obviously loved animals."
