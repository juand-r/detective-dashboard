    "full_text": "My friends and I rode up to Kim’s place and skidded to a stop in his driveway. He answered on the first ding-dong and invited us all inside, while he told his parents where he was going and what he was doing. Kim’s family had only lived in the United States for five years, and they were very protective of their son. They were also very interested in American customs, like Halloween, which was tomorrow night. “Hello, children,” Kim’s mother greeted us, coming out of the kitchen carrying a tray. “Would you all like some fresh-roasted pumpkin seeds?” Curtis shrugged his shoulders and scooped up a handful and popped them into his mouth. His face lit up like a jack o’ lantern as he discovered just how hot and fresh out of the oven they really were. Kim’s mother speaking in her broken English said, “American custom to carve up pumpkins and put candles in them and sit in front window. Korean custom not to waste anything.” Snatching a handful of seeds and chewing on them, Kim added, “Yeah, you should see the pies Mom baked. She made them out of the pumpkin we got – which is going to be the biggest and scariest on the block, by the way.” He turned to Dabney. “Are you ready to scope out our trick or treat route?” “Oh, yeah,” Dabney replied. “We’re going to hit maximum houses in minimum time this year, score the biggest load of sweets yet thanks to my planning.” He shook his head at Kim’s mother as she offered him the tray of pumpkin seeds. “I’ll take a pass, Mrs. Kwon. I’m actually allergic to seeds of any kind as some kids are allergic to peanuts.” We went outside and mounted our bikes. It was seven o’clock and already dark, with a cold wind blowing black clouds across the face of the huge moon hanging low in the night sky. “Spooky!” Curtis gulped. Taking the lead as usual, Dabney said, “Okay, goblins, I’ve got our Halloween route all mapped out in my head,” tapping the side of his overlarge cranium. “And Kim’s got the back-up on his GPS, just in case anyone gets lost. We’re gonna be so loaded down with candy tomorrow night, Curtis is gonna need my sister’s wagon to haul his load around.” Curtis was the smallest of the four of us with the muscular strength of an eight year-old girl. That is, as long as that girl wasn’t Dabney’s sister, Mary. She was built big and strong like her brother, and she just happened to be sitting on her bike across the street waiting for us. She had a serious crush on Curtis, for some reason. Dabney groaned when he saw her. “Uh, any of you ghouls object to the witch tagging along? I know Curtis won’t.” Curtis groaned back. We all put peddle to the metal chain and hit the streets, Mary pulling up the rear. We cruised right along Dabney’s chosen route, which featured densely packed streets and plenty of walk-up apartment buildings. It was a gold mine for treats, in other words. Half an hour later, we all skidded to a stop where the route and the sidewalk ended. Beyond was the old Mitchelson house, a boarded-up Victorian mansion sitting on a weed-strewn parcel of land that backed onto the river. Rumor was, the place was haunted. Under the cold, clouded moonlight, with a bitter wind making the dead leaves chatter and the skeleton trees dance, we could all believe it. “Hey, there’s a light on inside!” Curtis yelped, pointing at the eerie, dilapidated house. Kim, who wore thick glasses said, “I don’t see anything,” “Yeah, I don’t see anything, either,” I agreed, glancing nervously at the gloomy property. “No, I see something I tell you,” Curtis persisted. “There in the front window – a light flickering.” The guy was physically weak, but we all knew his eyesight was strong. “Let’s check it out, then, scaredy-cats,” Dabney said, always willing to take a dare or goad others into taking one. “I know just the person to lead the way.” He looked back over his shoulder and yelled, “Hey, sis, come here! We need you!” Mary eagerly peddled up to us. She smiled shyly at Curtis. Then, when her brother explained that she was going to be the first one through the door of the old Mitchelson house, she made a face like she’d eaten a rotten Halloween apple. “Oh, sure, great!” Mary whined. “You guys never include me in anything, unless it’s something dangerous or stupid. One day I’m going to get back at you … cowards,” she sniffed indignantly, as we all got off our bikes and crept across the overgrown lawn towards the shuttered and shunned house with an eight year-old girl leading the way. There was definitely a light in the front window of the abandoned mansion, that much was confirmed as we drew closer. It was faint, flickering behind tattered curtains, but it was there – even though nobody had been home for years. We stepped up onto the rotted porch. Mary tentatively reached out, grasped the hanging brass doorknob on the weatherworn door. Her brother shoved her from behind right through the door and into the old house. The hallway was shrouded in darkness. We tiptoed forward, floorboards creaking ominously. “In here!” Mary whispered up ahead. We rounded a corner of the hall and peered into the long-disused living room of the musty house. There was a candle burning in the front window – inside an enormous, evil-looking pumpkin! The wind whistled in the eaves and broken shutters slapped against the worm-eaten wooden sides of the house, as we stared at that glowering pumpkin, holding our breath. The thing had huge, grotesque eyes and a tremendous, broken-toothed grin carved into it, glowing orange and yellow by the light of the flickering candle, glaring almost right at us from across the shadow-laden room. I couldn’t see my friends on either side of me. But I could see that pumpkin – rising! I heard a squeaking sound, like a wheel turning. Then a high-pitched, girlish scream cut loose right next to me, almost blowing out my eardrums as sharp fingernails bit into my arm. The pumpkin rose right up into the air, hovering, grinning frightfully down at us. I was the first one out the front door, across the lawn and onto my bike. My ears were ringing, and my blood was running cold. I’m no hero. I didn’t stop peddling until I was back in Kim’s driveway. The rest of my equally heroic companions braked to a stop not far behind me. “The place is haunted! By a giant pumpkin!” Curtis gasped. “I-I don’t know if I even want to go out trick or treating tomorrow night,” Kim breathed. “Some American customs are just too scary.” Dabney wiped sweat off his pale forehead, as his saucer-eyed sister pressed her bike close to his. I started getting my breath back, the icy blood in my veins warming up enough to begin flowing into my brain again enabling me to think almost clearly. “Don’t fear the jack o’ lantern,” I stated boldly. “The old Mitchelson place isn’t haunted – except by a Halloween trickster. Somebody rigged that pumpkin to fly, in order to scare us. When we all go back there, we can figure out who.” Mary’s high-pitched scream made my ears ring all over again. It took some convincing and the assurance of Kim’s father’s cell phone and flashlight, but I finally persuaded my friends to ride back with me to the Mitchelson house. Once there, I quickly ran over to the still lit-up pumpkin, now resting comfortably back on its table and examined it up-close. Then I waved the others over with the flashlight. “See,” I said, grabbing onto the nearly invisible fishing line and lifting the pumpkin, with some effort. “This giant gourd didn’t jump up all on its own. Someone poked four small holes in it and threaded through some fishing line and then used a pulley system to reel the pumpkin upwards.” I shone the flashlight on the pulley screwed into the ceiling of the living room directly above the pumpkin. Then I shone a light on the guilty party. “I know who that someone is…..”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could possibly have set the trick up?  \n • Only someone in the little gang was on the scene when the pumpkin “flew”.  \n • The pumpkin weighed a lot – when I lifted it later I “needed some effort”.  A small, weak child such as Curtis could never have hoisted it repeatedly; Kim is book-ish and slight; Dabney and his sister Mary are the two strong ones.  \n • The pumpkin had to be installed, four holes bored, fishing line threaded, a pulley screwed into a ten-foot Victorian ceiling and a reel or wind-up handle positioned.  That work had to be done well before 7 p.m., because we saw the candle already burning from the sidewalk.  Therefore the culprit had to have had free time earlier that afternoon, before any of the boys arrived at Kim’s house.\n\n2. Who had that free time?  \n • Kim was at home under the watchful eye of his parents, carving, roasting seeds and baking pies with his mother.  \n • Curtis and I arrived at Kim’s together.  \n • Dabney arrived with Curtis and me.  \n • Mary, however, was not with us—she was already sitting on her bike across the street “waiting for us” when we first saw her.  In other words, nobody can say what she had been doing for the previous hour.\n\n3. Who had a motive?  \n • Mary had just complained bitterly: “You guys never include me in anything unless it’s something dangerous or stupid.  One day I’m going to get back at you… cowards!”  A perfect reason for a practical-joke revenge.  \n • Dabney loves planning but never expressed any wish to scare us.  \n • Kim and Curtis had no grievance.\n\n4. Who had the chance to operate the hoist?  \n • When we entered the house Mary went in first (“In here!” she whispered).  That placed her beside the hidden reel.  \n • I heard a “squeaking sound, like a wheel turning” a split-second before the pumpkin rose; the sound came from the darkness in front of us—exactly where Mary was standing.  \n • Immediately after the squeak the same person let out an ear-splitting “girlish scream” right beside me, digging sharp fingernails into my arm.  She was acting frightened while simultaneously cranking the line.\n\n5. Physical evidence once the lights came on  \n • When I shone the torch round, Mary was still holding the handle of a small fishing-reel; the near-invisible monofilament line ran from that reel to the pulley overhead and back down through the four holes in the pumpkin.  Nobody else was anywhere near the operating end of the line.\n\nPutting motive, opportunity, and physical evidence together, only one person fits every point: Mary.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nKim Kwon, Curtis (surname not given), Dabney Thompson, Mary Thompson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMary Thompson\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Earlier in the afternoon Mary, smarting from always being used as the “guinea-pig”, cycled to the abandoned Mitchelson house.  \n• She carried the huge jack-o’-lantern (probably borrowed while the boys were distracted in Kim’s kitchen), a flashlight, fishing line, a small reel and a screw-eye pulley.  \n• Inside the vacant living-room she screwed the pulley into a ceiling joist, bored four tiny holes around the stem of the pumpkin, threaded the line, tied it off, and attached the free end to her reel.  \n• She put a candle inside, lit it, pulled the curtains mostly shut, left the reel hidden behind a dusty wing-chair and hurried home in time to be “waiting” across the street when the boys appeared.  \n• During the ride she made sure Dabney’s carefully memorised route would end at the Mitchelson place.  \n• Once inside, she slipped to the reel, gave it a crank (the squeak we heard) and simultaneously produced a blood-curdling scream to stampede the others.  \n• After everyone fled she let the pumpkin down again and followed them out, apparently as shaken as anyone else.  \n• When we returned with a flashlight Mary still had the reel in her hand, betraying her.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nKim Kwon – Spent the afternoon under his parents’ eyes carving the pumpkin, roasting seeds and baking pies; physically slight; was behind the group when the pumpkin rose, nowhere near the reel.  \nCurtis – Physically too weak to hoist the giant pumpkin or screw a pulley into the ceiling; eyesight good, yes, but that only allowed him to notice the candle at a distance.  \nDabney Thompson – Big and bold but had no motive, expressed no desire for revenge, and was beside me, not near the reel, when the squeak sounded; he was as surprised as the rest of us.  \nTherefore only Mary had motive, prior opportunity, the physical ability, and was caught literally holding the line.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

They were also very interested in American customs, like Halloween, which was tomorrow night. “Hello, children,” Kim’s mother greeted us, coming out of the kitchen carrying a tray. “Would you all like some fresh-roasted pumpkin seeds?” Curtis shrugged his shoulders and scooped up a handful and popped them into his mouth. His face lit up like a jack o’ lantern as he discovered just how hot and fresh out of the oven they really were. Kim’s mother speaking in her broken English said, “American custom to carve up pumpkins and put candles in them and sit in front window. Korean custom not to waste anything.” Snatching a handful of seeds and chewing on them, Kim added, “Yeah, you should see the pies Mom baked. She made them out of the pumpkin we got – which is going to be the biggest and scariest on the block, by the way.” He turned to Dabney. “Are you ready to scope out our trick or treat route?” “Oh, yeah,” Dabney replied. “We’re going to hit maximum houses in minimum time this year, score the biggest load of sweets yet thanks to my planning.” He shook his head at Kim’s mother as she offered him the tray of pumpkin seeds. “I’ll take a pass, Mrs. Kwon. I’m actually allergic to seeds of any kind as some kids are allergic to peanuts.” We went outside and mounted our bikes. It was seven o’clock and already dark, with a cold wind blowing black clouds across the face of the huge moon hanging low in the night sky. “Spooky!” Curtis gulped. Taking the lead as usual, Dabney said, “Okay, goblins, I’ve got our Halloween route all mapped out in my head,” tapping the side of his overlarge cranium. “And Kim’s got the back-up on his GPS, just in case anyone gets lost. We’re gonna be so loaded down with candy tomorrow night, Curtis is gonna need my sister’s wagon to haul his load around.” Curtis was the smallest of the four of us with the muscular strength of an eight year-old girl. That is, as long as that girl wasn’t Dabney’s sister, Mary. She was built big and strong like her brother, and she just happened to be sitting on her bike across the street waiting for us. She had a serious crush on Curtis, for some reason. Dabney groaned when he saw her. “Uh, any of you ghouls object to the witch tagging along? I know Curtis won’t.” Curtis groaned back. We all put peddle to the metal chain and hit the streets, Mary pulling up the rear. We cruised right along Dabney’s chosen route, which featured densely packed streets and plenty of walk-up apartment buildings. It was a gold mine for treats, in other words. Half an hour later, we all skidded to a stop where the route and the sidewalk ended. Beyond was the old Mitchelson house, a boarded-up Victorian mansion sitting on a weed-strewn parcel of land that backed onto the river. Rumor was, the place was haunted. Under the cold, clouded moonlight, with a bitter wind making the dead leaves chatter and the skeleton trees dance, we could all believe it. “Hey, there’s a light on inside!” Curtis yelped, pointing at the eerie, dilapidated house. Kim, who wore thick glasses said, “I don’t see anything,” “Yeah, I don’t see anything, either,” I agreed, glancing nervously at the gloomy property. “No, I see something I tell you,” Curtis persisted. “There in the front window – a light flickering.” The guy was physically weak, but we all knew his eyesight was strong. “Let’s check it out, then, scaredy-cats,” Dabney said, always willing to take a dare or goad others into taking one. “I know just the person to lead the way.” He looked back over his shoulder and yelled, “Hey, sis, come here! We need you!” Mary eagerly peddled up to us. She smiled shyly at Curtis. Then, when her brother explained that she was going to be the first one through the door of the old Mitchelson house, she made a face like she’d eaten a rotten Halloween apple. “Oh, sure, great!” Mary whined. “You guys never include me in anything, unless it’s something dangerous or stupid. One day I’m going to get back at you … cowards,” she sniffed indignantly, as we all got off our bikes and crept across the overgrown lawn towards the shuttered and shunned house with an eight year-old girl leading the way. There was definitely a light in the front window of the abandoned mansion, that much was confirmed as we drew closer. It was faint, flickering behind tattered curtains, but it was there – even though nobody had been home for years. We stepped up onto the rotted porch. Mary tentatively reached out, grasped the hanging brass doorknob on the weatherworn door. Her brother shoved her from behind right through the door and into the old house. The hallway was shrouded in darkness. We tiptoed forward, floorboards creaking ominously. “In here!” Mary whispered up ahead. We rounded a corner of the hall and peered into the long-disused living room of the musty house. There was a candle burning in the front window – inside an enormous, evil-looking pumpkin! The wind whistled in the eaves and broken shutters slapped against the worm-eaten wooden sides of the house, as we stared at that glowering pumpkin, holding our breath. The thing had huge, grotesque eyes and a tremendous, broken-toothed grin carved into it, glowing orange and yellow by the light of the flickering candle, glaring almost right at us from across the shadow-laden room. I couldn’t see my friends on either side of me. But I could see that pumpkin – rising! I heard a squeaking sound, like a wheel turning. Then a high-pitched, girlish scream cut loose right next to me, almost blowing out my eardrums as sharp fingernails bit into my arm. The pumpkin rose right up into the air, hovering, grinning frightfully down at us. I was the first one out the front door, across the lawn and onto my bike. My ears were ringing, and my blood was running cold. I’m no hero. I didn’t stop peddling until I was back in Kim’s driveway. The rest of my equally heroic companions braked to a stop not far behind me. “The place is haunted! By a giant pumpkin!” Curtis gasped. “I-I don’t know if I even want to go out trick or treating tomorrow night,” Kim breathed. “Some American customs are just too scary.” Dabney wiped sweat off his pale forehead, as his saucer-eyed sister pressed her bike close to his. I started getting my breath back, the icy blood in my veins warming up enough to begin flowing into my brain again enabling me to think almost clearly. “Don’t fear the jack o’ lantern,” I stated boldly. “The old Mitchelson place isn’t haunted – except by a Halloween trickster. Somebody rigged that pumpkin to fly, in order to scare us. When we all go back there, we can figure out who.” Mary’s high-pitched scream made my ears ring all over again. It took some convincing and the assurance of Kim’s father’s cell phone and flashlight, but I finally persuaded my friends to ride back with me to the Mitchelson house. Once there, I quickly ran over to the still lit-up pumpkin, now resting comfortably back on its table and examined it up-close. Then I waved the others over with the flashlight. “See,” I said, grabbing onto the nearly invisible fishing line and lifting the pumpkin, with some effort. “This giant gourd didn’t jump up all on its own. Someone poked four small holes in it and threaded through some fishing line and then used a pulley system to reel the pumpkin upwards.” I shone the flashlight on the pulley screwed into the ceiling of the living room directly above the pumpkin. Then I shone a light on the guilty party. “I know who that someone is…..”",

      "answer": "(c) Kim",
      "outcome": "“That someone is … Kim.”\n“What!” he protested. “No! Dabney’s the one who planned the route – he knew our last stop would be the old Mitchelson house.”\n“True. But Dabney’s allergic to seeds, remember? He wouldn’t be carving out a pumpkin. Plus, he gave you the route to map out on your GPS.”\n“What about Curtis?” Kim parried.\n“Too small and weak to lug such a large pumpkin around,” I countered.\n“Mary?”\n“She was standing right next to me when the giant pumpkin rose up into the air, clinging to my arm. I have the fingernail marks to prove it. She wasn’t hoisting any pumpkin on a pulley. She was digging her fingernails into my arm.”\nKim grinned sheepishly. “Trick or treat?”"
