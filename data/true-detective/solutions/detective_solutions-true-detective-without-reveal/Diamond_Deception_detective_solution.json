    "full_text": "When Madam Rosler’s priceless red diamond, the Star of Hearts, was stolen, the staff at her country house was not unduly concerned that the police could not be at the scene of the robbery until much later that day. Mr. Seppings, the butler, announced that he would take charge of things at the house and such was the faith of the household in his keen intelligence and calm self-assurance. No one questioned his instructions when he arranged for the four people suspected of taking the diamond to be assembled in the room from which the valuable item had been taken. Mrs. Rosler was away for a short hospital stay and Mr. Seppings insisted that she should not be informed of what had occurred until everything was resolved. It certainly sent an uneasy ripple of tension through the four suspects gathered in the living room when Mr. Seppings seemed so sure that the matter would be fixed and settled before the police even arrived. Only Mr. Seppings had been told of the diamond’s whereabouts, although it seemed that someone else must have discerned the hiding place. The living room cabinet, which had contained the jewel, had been found smashed open with the refreshment trolley. The cabinet stood in a corner by the window, the refreshment trolley had collided with it resulting in the colored glass shattering and no doubt revealing the diamond inside. Mr. Seppings and the housekeeper, Mrs. Smith, had gone to visit Mrs. Rosler in the hospital, leaving four workmen in charge of the house and grounds while the other staff had a day off. It was these four men: John, Horace, Lewis and Jake who were gathered together in the living room accused of being the thief. John and Jake stood next to each other on one side of the room anxiously discussing the mud on John’s boots. Meanwhile, Lewis was seated in a chair trying to keep from standing out, something his well over six-foot frame made difficult. At slightly over five feet, Horace found it much easier to shrink into the background. Mrs. Smith thought that the matter was a very clear-cut one. She pointed out to Mr. Seppings how a line of muddy footprints matching the tread of John’s boots could be seen plainly on the carpet of the living room. The footprints entered from the doorway and led up to the center of the room where the trolley had been and then out again. John insisted that he hadn’t taken the diamond but when asked by the housekeeper how he explained the presence of the footprints, he fell silent. “They certainly were John’s boots weren’t they?” Mr. Seppings said as he looked down at the wide tread, grubby working boots John was wearing and then observed the matching marks on the carpet. “I’ve had a bad feeling about there being a thief in the house since some small things went missing from one of the dining room cupboards last month,” said Mrs. Smith. “This is poor Mrs. Rosler’s favorite room, she’s usually in and out of here all day. I put a note up on the kitchen fridge at midday to say that she was gone but I didn’t speak to anyone about it. Mrs. Rosler insists on managing some of the deliveries herself so I wanted any couriers dropping supplies off in the kitchen to know not to wait for her.” Mr. Seppings then turned his attention to the sitting room window, which was standing open. “This window was in need of repair. I gave instructions that it should remain shut at all times until it was fixed,” Mr. Seppings said. “It’s broken in such a way that opening it damages the wood on whichever side it is opened from. Everyone who works here knows that if they were to open this window and so cause additional damage they could be fired. Mr. Seppings balanced on a chair and made a quick examination of the window by lightly running his fingers along the splintered outer frame while Mrs. Smith anxiously urged him to be careful. “Now Mr. Seppings, Sir, that’s six feet off the ground on the outside. If you fall, you’ll have an awful bang.” “Let me see, the window is nearly fully open and no ladder marks to be seen.” Mr. Seppings muttered to himself. “All right Mrs. Smith, I am quite finished now,” he said as he climbed stiffly down. “Now,” he commanded, “who was working where today?” After a few moments of silence, Jake spoke up. “John was working in the back yard on some loose plumbing and I was in the cellar putting in some new wiring. Lewis and Horace worked outside together. Horace and I had our break together at eleven; Lewis and John had a break together at two thirty.” “You have your breaks here in the kitchen?” Mr. Seppings asked. “Yes that’s right,” Jake replied. “Well” Mr. Seppings started, “looking at the footprints on the carpet, it is pretty clear who stole the diamond.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Whoever stole the stone had to get the cabinet open, take the jewel and get away without being seen.\n   • A refreshment-trolley had been rammed against the cabinet from the centre of the carpeted floor; the muddy prints stop where the trolley originally stood and never go as far as the corner where the broken cabinet actually is.  \n     ⇒ The person who left those muddy prints never went near the diamond – therefore the prints cannot belong to the thief; they are merely a red-herring.\n\n2. How did the real thief reach the room?\n   • The living-room window is almost six feet above the outside ground.  \n   • The wood on the OUTER frame is freshly splintered.  \n   • Mr Seppings looked for – and did not find – any ladder marks in the soft, muddy soil.  \n     ⇒ The window was pulled open from the OUTSIDE by somebody tall enough to reach it without a ladder.\n\n3. Who could have opened the window from the outside without a ladder?\n   • Lewis is described as “well over six-foot”.  \n   • Horace is barely five-foot; John and Jake are of average height (no hint that either is exceptionally tall).  \n     ⇒ Only Lewis could have done it unaided.\n\n4. Who had the necessary opportunity and the motive?\n   • At midday Mrs Smith put the notice on the kitchen fridge saying that Madam Rosler was away.  \n   • The only workers who definitely saw that notice were the two who took their break in the kitchen AFTER midday – namely John and Lewis (their 2 : 30 break).  \n   • John’s muddied boots show he had been working in the back yard; his prints are the useless set that stop in the middle of the room.  \n   • Lewis, having seen that Madam was absent, stayed outside, waited until he was alone, walked up to the living-room wall, reached up, wrenched the faulty window open (splintering the outer frame), climbed in, shoved the refreshment trolley across the carpet to shatter the glass cabinet, pocketed the Star of Hearts, climbed out again and left the window almost fully open.\n\n5. Why weren’t Lewis’s footprints found?\n   • He came straight in through the window beside the cabinet, so he never crossed the carpeted area where the prints were noticed.  \n   • The flower-beds beneath the window were dry gravel, not sticky mud – hence no obvious marks indoors or out.\n\nConclusion: the only person who could physically have opened the window from outside without a ladder AND who certainly knew the mistress was absent was Lewis.  The muddy prints implicating John merely misled the housekeeper; they do not reach the cabinet and therefore cannot belong to the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohn, Jake, Lewis, Horace, Mr. Seppings, Mrs. Smith\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nLewis\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n12:00 p.m.  –  Mrs Smith posts a note on the kitchen refrigerator telling the staff that Madam Rosler is away in hospital.\n\n2:30 p.m.  –  John and Lewis come into the kitchen for their break.  Reading the note, Lewis realises the priceless red diamond is unattended.\n\nShortly afterwards Lewis returns to the grounds, keeping out of sight of the others.  Being well over six feet tall, he can reach the defective living-room window from the ground.  He pulls it outward; the broken mechanism splinters the outer frame, proving it was opened from outside and leaving no ladder marks.\n\nLewis hauls himself through the window into the corner of the living room.  A refreshment trolley is standing in the centre of the carpet.  He gives it a hard shove so that it careers across the floor and smashes the coloured-glass cabinet that hides the Star of Hearts.  He picks up the jewel, climbs back out through the window and walks away across the gravel path, leaving no obvious footprints.\n\nEarlier that morning John had walked into the room in muddy boots to fetch a tool, inadvertently laying the conspicuous line of prints that end where the trolley once stood.  Those prints never approach the cabinet and therefore have nothing to do with the robbery, but they mislead Mrs Smith into thinking John is the thief.\n\nWhen the butler and housekeeper return they find the smashed cabinet, the open window with its freshly splintered OUTER frame and John’s muddy prints.  Mr Seppings notices that only a very tall man could have opened the window without a ladder.  Among the four workmen that can only be Lewis, so the theft is solved.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJohn – His muddy footprints do not go within several feet of the cabinet; they stop where the trolley was standing.  They show he never approached the hiding place and therefore did not pick up the diamond.\n\nJake – Spent the day rewiring the cellar.  He would have had to fetch a ladder to reach the outside of the high window, yet no ladder marks were found in the soft soil.\n\nHorace – At barely five feet tall he could not possibly have reached the window from the ground.  He was working outside with Lewis; while that gives him opportunity to be near the house, it gives him no physical means to open the window.\n\nMrs. Smith – She was away at the hospital with Mr Seppings when the robbery occurred.\n\nMr. Seppings – Although he alone knew the exact hiding place, the physical clues show the thief entered from outside by way of the high window; Seppings was at the hospital and could not have opened it from the ground even if he had been present.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
