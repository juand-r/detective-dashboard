    "full_text": "\"I can so!\" \"You can not! No one can train a cat to fetch.\" Muggles the cat was smart — and talented. But no one knew it, and his owner, fifteen-year-old Andy, couldn't make anyone believe it. This led to a strange crime, which involved a cat, a teenager, and an unsolved mystery. That month, four cats in his neighborhood had already disappeared. The owners had searched, but their cats were never found. Meanwhile, in a big old house across town, a strange woman lived with over forty cats. The town was also surprisingly famous for its cats. All across the country, TV shows included a pet food commercial, showcasing cats doing amazing tricks. Joshua Sellers was a film producer who had discovered cats that could magically leap through hoops, or do dances on their hind legs. Every commercial featured a new and talented cat, and Sellers always boasted that he'd found every cat himself. But because of the neighborhood's cat-stealing, Andy's parents had wanted to buy him a dog for a pet instead. Andy told them that cats were cooler; though Andy's friend, Rick, insisted his dog was better — only because it could fetch a rubber ball. One afternoon, a crowd of five students had gathered around the two. They all stood behind Rick. “Your cat can't even climb the fence around your back yard,” Rick taunted. Angry and offended, Andy invited them all to his house after school — to settle the pet debate once and for all. Throughout the school, students gossiped about Andy’s cat; and by the end of the day, a crowd of thirty students was en route to his house. Andy's mother was surprised, and a bit alarmed when she saw the troops arriving. \"Can I get you anything, Andy? she asked. \"Yeah. A piece of foil.\" Andy went into the backyard alone, and closed the sliding glass door behind him. \"I don't care what my friends think,\" he told the cat honestly. \"But can we give it a try?\" And then he reached into his pocket and pulled out the crumpled foil. Muggles stared as Andy twiddled it between his fingers. What was that shiny thing? \"There it goes!\" Andy shouted, tossing the foil to the ground. Muggles leapt after the ball of foil — and the thirty students inside his house cheered. When Muggles had the ball in his mouth, Andy called out to him with a poignant emotion in his voice than trumped his youthful conscience. Muggles had his ears perked up, but he didn't want to let go of the foil. He ran to where Andy stood firm, still holding the foil in his mouth. And the students in his house cheered again. Rick was peeved, but everybody ignored him, chanting: \"Andy was right. Right was Andy!” Victory eluded Andy that night when his winning partner, Muggles, disappeared. \"Do you think he wandered off into the night?\" Andy's mother asked. Muggles had never done that before, Andy insisted. But who would steal someone's cat? The only person who'd come by last night was the newspaper delivery boy, and that was around 6 p.m. Everyone in the neighborhood received a free copy of the evening newspaper. \"I'm sorry about your cat,\" said Rick, after Andy told him the news the next day at school. Rick had some bad news of his own. His mother had called the teacher, telling her that Rick's grandmother had been sick. She warned the teacher that Rick might be sleepy, because the whole family had spent the night in the hospital's waiting room. It was like everyone in town was having an unlucky night. Andy worried all day, and then decided there was only one thing to do. After school, Andy didn't go home. Instead he rode his bicycle to the untraveled edge of the neighborhood. Empty fields surrounded him, and the silenced consumed him. There were no kids playing ball, or parents calling out to their kids. There was just one thing: the massive house of the woman who was said to have forty cats. Could it really be true? And then he heard rustling at his feet. A cat was rubbing his leg. And behind it were five more cats. More cats peered from under the house, and more peeked around its corner. Suddenly, there were dozens and dozens of cats, all scampering towards Andy: white cats, grey cats, tabbies, and more! The yard filled with cats, all approaching and meowing. And the meowing cats could surely be heard inside the house. Suddenly, the door swung open like an oven. \"What are you doing to my cats?\" a voice shouted. Andy looked up to see a big woman with short black hair, and a very disturbed face. First he was scared, and then startled, as he whispered his response: “My name's Andy.” The woman looked, confused, as Andy continued, “I lost my cat.” “And you thought I stole him?” the woman said, defensively. “I came to check,” Andy said, honestly. \"Come inside,\" she said. Andy wasn't sure that he should. “My name's Edith,” her voice softened, “and I don’t scratch.” Andy smiled uncomfortably. “I love cats,” she said, melodically. “People always think I have stolen theirs. But, I just have a lot of cats.” Just then, he heard a car pulling up in the street behind him. Andy turned to see a man getting out, wearing an expensive suit. He had neatly-trimmed hair, dark sunglasses that didn’t rest quite right on his nose, and he was listening to the voicemail on his cellphone. Edith smiled, and introduced Andy: “Now here's a man who really likes cats.” The man stared at the ocean of cats surrounding Andy, scanning each one as though appraising them for an auction. Edith said proudly, “Meet a local celebrity, the man behind all those cat food commercials. Meet Joshua Sellers.” Joshua nodded with pride, still eying the cats in her yard. “I found some of my most-talented cats in this very yard. And now they're national TV stars!” Andy looked around. Beneath the cats, he could see the “lawn,” which Andy mentally redefined as “clumps of grass,” surrounded by wide patches of dirt. It seemed strange that nationally-acclaimed-cats could come from such a poorly-painted house. Andy saw a cage at the side of the yard. No cat would be happy in a cage for very long, but he knew that a cage was sometimes necessary; he used a kennel to transport Muggles to his doctor appointments. The cage was on top of yesterday’s free copy of the newspaper. Edith must have been reading Andy’s mind, he though. “I don't read the newspaper,” she sighed. “And I haven't used that cage for months, either. My precious cats hate being cooped up!” Mr. Sellers seemed a little disappointed that they weren't paying more attention to his career. “I just discovered an amazing cat,” he said excitedly. “I just flew to New York to appear on the David Letterman show, and I took the cat with me to impress him!” Andy couldn't help but wonder if the cat's trick was chasing foil. Mr. Sellers returned to his cellphone. “I've got 13 unheard voicemail messages,” he exclaimed. “Lucky 13!” He'd been so busy flying to New York yesterday morning, he'd forgotten to check his voicemail — until an hour ago, when he got back to the city. “I've got a story you can tell David Letterman,” said Andy. “Tell him I've figured out who's stealing the neighborhood's cats!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nI read the story several times and listed every time-reference and every clue that looks “out of place”.\n\n1.\tWHO HAS A MOTIVE?\n•\tEdith – loves cats, already owns more than forty.  Motive to steal? Only if she is compulsive-collector, but she says she lets them wander free and “hates cages”.\n•\tJoshua Sellers – makes money every time he finds an “amazing” cat for a national commercial.  A new, spectacularly talented cat means thousands of advertising dollars.  Obvious, strong motive.\n•\tNewspaper-delivery boy – no personal use for cats but he has access to every garden at about the same hour, can move round without arousing suspicion and could make easy money supplying a buyer.\n•\tRick – jealous, wants dogs to win the argument.  Motive is weak and childish; nothing to gain except wounded pride.\n2.\tWHO HAD OPPORTUNITY THE NIGHT MUGGLES VANISHED?\n•\tRick supposedly spent the whole night in the hospital waiting-room (teacher received a call from Rick’s mother first thing next morning – that is a solid alibi that Rick himself could not have arranged).\n•\tEdith is across town and has no reason to be outside Andy’s house at night.\n•\tDelivery boy definitely visited Andy’s porch at 6 p.m. – the only outsider known to be on the property; he could come back later with no one noticing.\n•\tSellers was on a plane to New York very early the next morning, but we are not told where he spent the previous evening.  He could have hired somebody.\n\n3.\tPHYSICAL / LOGICAL CLUES\n•\tThe cage in Edith’s yard is “on top of yesterday’s free copy of the newspaper.”  \n  ▪\tThe free newspaper is delivered at 6 p.m.  \n  ▪\tTherefore the cage was set down AFTER 6 p.m. yesterday.\n  ▪\tEdith says she “hasn’t used that cage for months.”  If she were telling the truth, the cage would be under the paper – not on top of it.  Somebody else must have brought it last night.\n•\tMuggles disappeared a few hours after the delivery boy’s visit – exactly the right time for the cage to have been moved.\n•\tSellers has “13 unheard voicemail messages.”  He flew out early the next morning and never listened to them.  Thirteen calls during one evening is consistent with an accomplice desperately trying to tell him, “I’ve got the new wonder-cat – call me back!”\n•\tSellers brags that he has “found every cat himself.”  Yet Edith says some of the cats in her yard were also “found” by Sellers.  The only reasonable way to reconcile those statements is that Sellers pays someone to dump newly-stolen cats temporarily among Edith’s forty – making them look like ordinary strays for Sellers to “discover.”\n\n4.\tPUTTING IT TOGETHER\nA pattern emerges:\n •\tDelivery boy cages a talented neighbourhood cat right after the paper-round.  \n •\tHe slips the cage into Edith’s over-crowded yard (nobody would notice one more cat).  \n •\tHe calls Sellers again and again.  \n •\tSellers turns up, “discovers” the gifted animal and whisks it off to stardom – or, at least, to a very profitable commercial.\n\nThat is exactly what must have happened to Muggles.  \nAndy realises it the moment he sees (a) the fresh newspaper under the cage and (b) Sellers turning up to “inspect” the stock an hour after landing back in town.  Hence he tells Sellers, “Tell David Letterman I’ve figured out who’s stealing the neighbourhood’s cats!”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEdith (the cat-lady), Joshua Sellers (commercial producer), Rick (Andy’s friend), the newspaper-delivery boy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJoshua Sellers\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nUnnamed newspaper-delivery boy\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1.\tWord of Muggles’s foil-fetching talent spreads through the school on the afternoon of the demonstration.\n2.\tThe newspaper-delivery boy hears the gossip while doing his 6 p.m. round (he is in and out of front gardens and hears neighbourhood talk).  Seeing Muggles close-up when he drops the free paper, he realises the cat really can fetch.\n3.\tKnowing that Joshua Sellers pays cash for any “TV-ready” cat, the delivery boy returns later that evening with a wire cage.  He lures or grabs Muggles, puts the cat in the cage, carries it across town and drops the cage inside Edith’s unfenced yard.  (He sets it down on top of that same newspaper he delivered earlier – creating the crucial clue.)\n4.\tHe telephones Sellers again and again, leaving thirteen voicemail messages about the remarkable new cat he has just obtained.\n5.\tVery early the next morning Sellers flies to New York to film a guest spot on the Letterman show.  On the way to the airport he stops at Edith’s, “discovers” the newly arrived cat (Muggles) and takes him along to impress the talk-show host.\n6.\tReturning to town late the following afternoon, Sellers drives straight to Edith’s yard to look for more talent and to settle up with his supplier.  Anxious Andy arrives moments before him and spots the fresh-paper / old-cage contradiction, which points straight to a overnight theft and therefore to Sellers and whoever delivered the paper.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nEdith – She really does adore cats and simply lets strays stay.  The cage on top of the fresh paper proves someone else set it there; Edith herself had no reason to put a cage on a newspaper she claims not to read.\n\nRick – His mother’s call to the teacher, plus the fact that an entire family was in a hospital waiting-room all night, gives him a solid alibi, and he has no real motive beyond childish rivalry.\n\nAndy – obviously the victim, not the thief.\n\nTherefore the commercially ambitious film-producer, Joshua Sellers, is the brains behind the thefts, helped by the newspaper-delivery boy who supplies him with any promising neighbourhood cat – including poor Muggles.",

That month, four cats in his neighborhood had already disappeared. The owners had searched, but their cats were never found. Meanwhile, in a big old house across town, a strange woman lived with over forty cats. The town was also surprisingly famous for its cats. All across the country, TV shows included a pet food commercial, showcasing cats doing amazing tricks. Joshua Sellers was a film producer who had discovered cats that could magically leap through hoops, or do dances on their hind legs. Every commercial featured a new and talented cat, and Sellers always boasted that he'd found every cat himself. But because of the neighborhood's cat-stealing, Andy's parents had wanted to buy him a dog for a pet instead. Andy told them that cats were cooler; though Andy's friend, Rick, insisted his dog was better — only because it could fetch a rubber ball. One afternoon, a crowd of five students had gathered around the two. They all stood behind Rick. “Your cat can't even climb the fence around your back yard,” Rick taunted. Angry and offended, Andy invited them all to his house after school — to settle the pet debate once and for all. Throughout the school, students gossiped about Andy’s cat; and by the end of the day, a crowd of thirty students was en route to his house. Andy's mother was surprised, and a bit alarmed when she saw the troops arriving. \"Can I get you anything, Andy? she asked. \"Yeah. A piece of foil.\" Andy went into the backyard alone, and closed the sliding glass door behind him. \"I don't care what my friends think,\" he told the cat honestly. \"But can we give it a try?\" And then he reached into his pocket and pulled out the crumpled foil. Muggles stared as Andy twiddled it between his fingers. What was that shiny thing? \"There it goes!\" Andy shouted, tossing the foil to the ground. Muggles leapt after the ball of foil — and the thirty students inside his house cheered. When Muggles had the ball in his mouth, Andy called out to him with a poignant emotion in his voice than trumped his youthful conscience. Muggles had his ears perked up, but he didn't want to let go of the foil. He ran to where Andy stood firm, still holding the foil in his mouth. And the students in his house cheered again. Rick was peeved, but everybody ignored him, chanting: \"Andy was right. Right was Andy!” Victory eluded Andy that night when his winning partner, Muggles, disappeared. \"Do you think he wandered off into the night?\" Andy's mother asked. Muggles had never done that before, Andy insisted. But who would steal someone's cat? The only person who'd come by last night was the newspaper delivery boy, and that was around 6 p.m. Everyone in the neighborhood received a free copy of the evening newspaper. \"I'm sorry about your cat,\" said Rick, after Andy told him the news the next day at school. Rick had some bad news of his own. His mother had called the teacher, telling her that Rick's grandmother had been sick. She warned the teacher that Rick might be sleepy, because the whole family had spent the night in the hospital's waiting room. It was like everyone in town was having an unlucky night. Andy worried all day, and then decided there was only one thing to do. After school, Andy didn't go home. Instead he rode his bicycle to the untraveled edge of the neighborhood. Empty fields surrounded him, and the silenced consumed him. There were no kids playing ball, or parents calling out to their kids. There was just one thing: the massive house of the woman who was said to have forty cats. Could it really be true? And then he heard rustling at his feet. A cat was rubbing his leg. And behind it were five more cats. More cats peered from under the house, and more peeked around its corner. Suddenly, there were dozens and dozens of cats, all scampering towards Andy: white cats, grey cats, tabbies, and more! The yard filled with cats, all approaching and meowing. And the meowing cats could surely be heard inside the house. Suddenly, the door swung open like an oven. \"What are you doing to my cats?\" a voice shouted. Andy looked up to see a big woman with short black hair, and a very disturbed face. First he was scared, and then startled, as he whispered his response: “My name's Andy.” The woman looked, confused, as Andy continued, “I lost my cat.” “And you thought I stole him?” the woman said, defensively. “I came to check,” Andy said, honestly. \"Come inside,\" she said. Andy wasn't sure that he should. “My name's Edith,” her voice softened, “and I don’t scratch.” Andy smiled uncomfortably. “I love cats,” she said, melodically. “People always think I have stolen theirs. But, I just have a lot of cats.” Just then, he heard a car pulling up in the street behind him. Andy turned to see a man getting out, wearing an expensive suit. He had neatly-trimmed hair, dark sunglasses that didn’t rest quite right on his nose, and he was listening to the voicemail on his cellphone. Edith smiled, and introduced Andy: “Now here's a man who really likes cats.” The man stared at the ocean of cats surrounding Andy, scanning each one as though appraising them for an auction. Edith said proudly, “Meet a local celebrity, the man behind all those cat food commercials. Meet Joshua Sellers.” Joshua nodded with pride, still eying the cats in her yard. “I found some of my most-talented cats in this very yard. And now they're national TV stars!” Andy looked around. Beneath the cats, he could see the “lawn,” which Andy mentally redefined as “clumps of grass,” surrounded by wide patches of dirt. It seemed strange that nationally-acclaimed-cats could come from such a poorly-painted house. Andy saw a cage at the side of the yard. No cat would be happy in a cage for very long, but he knew that a cage was sometimes necessary; he used a kennel to transport Muggles to his doctor appointments. The cage was on top of yesterday’s free copy of the newspaper. Edith must have been reading Andy’s mind, he though. “I don't read the newspaper,” she sighed. “And I haven't used that cage for months, either. My precious cats hate being cooped up!” Mr. Sellers seemed a little disappointed that they weren't paying more attention to his career. “I just discovered an amazing cat,” he said excitedly. “I just flew to New York to appear on the David Letterman show, and I took the cat with me to impress him!” Andy couldn't help but wonder if the cat's trick was chasing foil. Mr. Sellers returned to his cellphone. “I've got 13 unheard voicemail messages,” he exclaimed. “Lucky 13!” He'd been so busy flying to New York yesterday morning, he'd forgotten to check his voicemail — until an hour ago, when he got back to the city. “I've got a story you can tell David Letterman,” said Andy. “Tell him I've figured out who's stealing the neighborhood's cats!”",

      "answer": "(a) Edith",
      "outcome": "“It makes it hard to trust people when they steal your pet. I even suspected my friend Rick — until I realized that he'd spent the night at the hospital, and couldn't possibly have taken it.”\n“Are you sure your cat didn't run away?” Edith asked.\n“My mom wondered the same thing,”Andy admitted. “But even Rick knew that my cat couldn’t climb the fence around our back yard.”\n“Do you really know who stole the cat?” asked Mr. Sellers.\n“You're a likely suspect,” Andy told him firmly. “But you wouldn't have had time. You flew to New York yesterday morning and didn't return until an hour ago.”\n“You're accusing me, aren't you!” said Edith. “I told you I haven't touched my cage for months!”\n“Then how did the cage get on top of yesterday's newspaper?” Andy confirmed that the newspaper under the cage had yesterday's date. And looking inside the cage, Andy saw a crumpled piece of foil.\nEdith looked down sadly, and then began to cry. “I'd heard all the children talking about your wonderful cat. I love cats so much. And when I get lonely... I guess I do bad things.”\n“What a story,” said Mr. Sellers. “Maybe I can get you on the David Letterman show!”\nAndy shook his head. “All I want is my cat.”\nBy the end of the day, Muggles was back home with Andy, and all the other cats in the neighborhood had been returned to their rightful owners. Andy realized he didn't need the world to know how special his cat was.\nBecause he already knew that himself."
