    "full_text": "\"I can so!\" \"You can not! No one can train a cat to fetch.\" Muggles the cat was smart — and talented. But no one knew it, and his owner, fifteen-year-old Andy, couldn't make anyone believe it. This led to a strange crime, which involved a cat, a teenager, and an unsolved mystery. That month, four cats in his neighborhood had already disappeared. The owners had searched, but their cats were never found. Meanwhile, in a big old house across town, a strange woman lived with over forty cats. The town was also surprisingly famous for its cats. All across the country, TV shows included a pet food commercial, showcasing cats doing amazing tricks. Joshua Sellers was a film producer who had discovered cats that could magically leap through hoops, or do dances on their hind legs. Every commercial featured a new and talented cat, and Sellers always boasted that he'd found every cat himself. But because of the neighborhood's cat-stealing, Andy's parents had wanted to buy him a dog for a pet instead. Andy told them that cats were cooler; though Andy's friend, Rick, insisted his dog was better — only because it could fetch a rubber ball. One afternoon, a crowd of five students had gathered around the two. They all stood behind Rick. “Your cat can't even climb the fence around your back yard,” Rick taunted. Angry and offended, Andy invited them all to his house after school — to settle the pet debate once and for all. Throughout the school, students gossiped about Andy’s cat; and by the end of the day, a crowd of thirty students was en route to his house. Andy's mother was surprised, and a bit alarmed when she saw the troops arriving. \"Can I get you anything, Andy? she asked. \"Yeah. A piece of foil.\" Andy went into the backyard alone, and closed the sliding glass door behind him. \"I don't care what my friends think,\" he told the cat honestly. \"But can we give it a try?\" And then he reached into his pocket and pulled out the crumpled foil. Muggles stared as Andy twiddled it between his fingers. What was that shiny thing? \"There it goes!\" Andy shouted, tossing the foil to the ground. Muggles leapt after the ball of foil — and the thirty students inside his house cheered. When Muggles had the ball in his mouth, Andy called out to him with a poignant emotion in his voice than trumped his youthful conscience. Muggles had his ears perked up, but he didn't want to let go of the foil. He ran to where Andy stood firm, still holding the foil in his mouth. And the students in his house cheered again. Rick was peeved, but everybody ignored him, chanting: \"Andy was right. Right was Andy!” Victory eluded Andy that night when his winning partner, Muggles, disappeared. \"Do you think he wandered off into the night?\" Andy's mother asked. Muggles had never done that before, Andy insisted. But who would steal someone's cat? The only person who'd come by last night was the newspaper delivery boy, and that was around 6 p.m. Everyone in the neighborhood received a free copy of the evening newspaper. \"I'm sorry about your cat,\" said Rick, after Andy told him the news the next day at school. Rick had some bad news of his own. His mother had called the teacher, telling her that Rick's grandmother had been sick. She warned the teacher that Rick might be sleepy, because the whole family had spent the night in the hospital's waiting room. It was like everyone in town was having an unlucky night. Andy worried all day, and then decided there was only one thing to do. After school, Andy didn't go home. Instead he rode his bicycle to the untraveled edge of the neighborhood. Empty fields surrounded him, and the silenced consumed him. There were no kids playing ball, or parents calling out to their kids. There was just one thing: the massive house of the woman who was said to have forty cats. Could it really be true? And then he heard rustling at his feet. A cat was rubbing his leg. And behind it were five more cats. More cats peered from under the house, and more peeked around its corner. Suddenly, there were dozens and dozens of cats, all scampering towards Andy: white cats, grey cats, tabbies, and more! The yard filled with cats, all approaching and meowing. And the meowing cats could surely be heard inside the house. Suddenly, the door swung open like an oven. \"What are you doing to my cats?\" a voice shouted. Andy looked up to see a big woman with short black hair, and a very disturbed face. First he was scared, and then startled, as he whispered his response: “My name's Andy.” The woman looked, confused, as Andy continued, “I lost my cat.” “And you thought I stole him?” the woman said, defensively. “I came to check,” Andy said, honestly. \"Come inside,\" she said. Andy wasn't sure that he should. “My name's Edith,” her voice softened, “and I don’t scratch.” Andy smiled uncomfortably. “I love cats,” she said, melodically. “People always think I have stolen theirs. But, I just have a lot of cats.” Just then, he heard a car pulling up in the street behind him. Andy turned to see a man getting out, wearing an expensive suit. He had neatly-trimmed hair, dark sunglasses that didn’t rest quite right on his nose, and he was listening to the voicemail on his cellphone. Edith smiled, and introduced Andy: “Now here's a man who really likes cats.” The man stared at the ocean of cats surrounding Andy, scanning each one as though appraising them for an auction. Edith said proudly, “Meet a local celebrity, the man behind all those cat food commercials. Meet Joshua Sellers.” Joshua nodded with pride, still eying the cats in her yard. “I found some of my most-talented cats in this very yard. And now they're national TV stars!” Andy looked around. Beneath the cats, he could see the “lawn,” which Andy mentally redefined as “clumps of grass,” surrounded by wide patches of dirt. It seemed strange that nationally-acclaimed-cats could come from such a poorly-painted house. Andy saw a cage at the side of the yard. No cat would be happy in a cage for very long, but he knew that a cage was sometimes necessary; he used a kennel to transport Muggles to his doctor appointments. The cage was on top of yesterday’s free copy of the newspaper. Edith must have been reading Andy’s mind, he though. “I don't read the newspaper,” she sighed. “And I haven't used that cage for months, either. My precious cats hate being cooped up!” Mr. Sellers seemed a little disappointed that they weren't paying more attention to his career. “I just discovered an amazing cat,” he said excitedly. “I just flew to New York to appear on the David Letterman show, and I took the cat with me to impress him!” Andy couldn't help but wonder if the cat's trick was chasing foil. Mr. Sellers returned to his cellphone. “I've got 13 unheard voicemail messages,” he exclaimed. “Lucky 13!” He'd been so busy flying to New York yesterday morning, he'd forgotten to check his voicemail — until an hour ago, when he got back to the city. “I've got a story you can tell David Letterman,” said Andy. “Tell him I've figured out who's stealing the neighborhood's cats!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Start with the night Muggles vanished.  \n •  The only human seen near the house was the FREE-EVENING-NEWSPAPER carrier who came at about 6 p.m.  \n •  Therefore whoever caged the cat later that evening had a fresh copy of that same free paper.\n\n2. At Edith’s the next day Andy notices:  \n •  A transport cage that (a) Edith swears she has not used for “months”, and (b) is lined with yesterday’s edition of that very same free paper.  \n •  Edith also says she never even reads the paper.  \n ⇒  Somebody who is NOT Edith used the cage YESTERDAY NIGHT.  \n\n3. Who had both a reason to steal talented cats and regular access to Edith’s yard?  \n •  Joshua Sellers – the television producer who proudly says he “found” every cat that appears in his commercials – regularly visits Edith to “look over” her animals.  \n •  He is the one person Edith herself invites freely onto the property, so he could use her cage without her noticing.  \n •  When Andy meets him he is studying the cats “as though appraising them for an auction” – the behaviour of a dealer, not a rescuer.  \n\n4. Motive.  \n •  Four neighbourhood cats have already vanished.  Sellers makes money every time he turns a clever cat into a TV star.  “Finding” an already-trained or unusually talented cat is faster and cheaper than training one from scratch.  \n •  Muggles has just demonstrated a unique trick – fetching foil – in front of dozens of children, so the news would spread quickly round town.  A talent scout like Sellers would pounce on that information.\n\n5. Opportunity & timing.  \n •  Sellers claims he left town “yesterday morning” to fly to New York with “an amazing cat” he had just discovered.  \n •  Muggles disappeared late LAST NIGHT.  Sellers could have lifted the cat first thing in the morning, dropped him in the cage lined with the previous evening’s paper and driven straight to the airport.  \n •  Edith’s house, sitting on the edge of town, is a perfect, little-noticed rendez-vous.  \n\n6. Physical clues that point at Sellers:  \n •  His dark glasses “don’t rest quite right on his nose” – very likely hiding fresh scratches a frightened cat gave him during capture.  \n •  The cage lined with the free paper is the smoking gun.  Edith didn’t put it there; the only other regular visitor with a reason to cage cats on her property is Sellers.\n\n7. Alibis tested.  \n •  Rick has an alibi supplied by his entire family (hospital visit).  There is no evidence contradicting it.  \n •  The newspaper boy did visit the neighbourhood, but he had no reason to trespass on Edith’s property or to select only the most talented animals; moreover Andy sees him only from the street, never anywhere near the cage.  \n •  Edith herself loves her cats, despises cages, and did not even notice the fresh newspaper; she is merely being used.\n\nLogical deduction:  the person with motive, means and opportunity – and whose behaviour and the physical evidence (fresh-paper-lined cage) directly implicate him – is Joshua Sellers.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJoshua Sellers, Edith (the cat-lover), Rick, the newspaper delivery boy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJoshua Sellers\n</CULPRT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Word that Andy’s cat could “fetch like a dog” spreads through the school during the afternoon.  \n• One of the children (or an envious parent) telephones Joshua Sellers, the well-known cat-talent promoter, telling him about the remarkable animal.  \n• Determined to secure the cat before a rival does, Sellers drives to Andy’s street that evening.  He sees Muggles in the yard, entices him with a piece of foil, grabs him, gets clawed across the nose, but succeeds in stuffing the cat into a carrier in his car.  \n• Knowing he is flying to New York early next morning and needing somewhere quiet to leave the cat overnight, he slips into Edith’s unfenced yard (he visits her so often she will not suspect him), lines her unused cage with the only thing handy – yesterday’s free newspaper – and locks Muggles inside.  \n• Before dawn he returns, collects the cage, and heads to the airport.  Muggles becomes the “amazing cat” he brags about showing David Letterman.  \n• Sellers returns from New York the following afternoon, still wearing dark glasses to hide the scratch marks, and comes back to Edith’s to look for new prospects – only to run into Andy, who has already noticed (i) the fresh newspaper in the cage, (ii) Edith’s insistence she never uses either newspapers or that cage, and (iii) Sellers’ obvious commercial interest in talented neighbourhood cats.  Andy therefore realises that Joshua Sellers must be the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Edith – The cage’s fresh lining proves someone ELSE used it; Edith neither reads the paper nor cages her pets.  All her cats roam free, and she gains nothing by stealing others’.  \n• Rick – His jealousy gives him a motive, but his entire family and the hospital staff can corroborate his alibi for the whole night.  No physical evidence ties him to the crime.  \n• Newspaper delivery boy – He did visit every house, but nothing links him to Edith’s property or the cage.  He distributes papers; he doesn’t collect cats, and he has no apparent way of profiting from stolen pets.  Only Sellers monetises clever cats.  \nThus Joshua Sellers is the one and only culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

One afternoon, a crowd of five students had gathered around the two. They all stood behind Rick. “Your cat can't even climb the fence around your back yard,” Rick taunted. Angry and offended, Andy invited them all to his house after school — to settle the pet debate once and for all. Throughout the school, students gossiped about Andy’s cat; and by the end of the day, a crowd of thirty students was en route to his house. Andy's mother was surprised, and a bit alarmed when she saw the troops arriving. \"Can I get you anything, Andy? she asked. \"Yeah. A piece of foil.\" Andy went into the backyard alone, and closed the sliding glass door behind him. \"I don't care what my friends think,\" he told the cat honestly. \"But can we give it a try?\" And then he reached into his pocket and pulled out the crumpled foil. Muggles stared as Andy twiddled it between his fingers. What was that shiny thing? \"There it goes!\" Andy shouted, tossing the foil to the ground. Muggles leapt after the ball of foil — and the thirty students inside his house cheered. When Muggles had the ball in his mouth, Andy called out to him with a poignant emotion in his voice than trumped his youthful conscience. Muggles had his ears perked up, but he didn't want to let go of the foil. He ran to where Andy stood firm, still holding the foil in his mouth. And the students in his house cheered again. Rick was peeved, but everybody ignored him, chanting: \"Andy was right. Right was Andy!” Victory eluded Andy that night when his winning partner, Muggles, disappeared. \"Do you think he wandered off into the night?\" Andy's mother asked. Muggles had never done that before, Andy insisted. But who would steal someone's cat? The only person who'd come by last night was the newspaper delivery boy, and that was around 6 p.m. Everyone in the neighborhood received a free copy of the evening newspaper. \"I'm sorry about your cat,\" said Rick, after Andy told him the news the next day at school. Rick had some bad news of his own. His mother had called the teacher, telling her that Rick's grandmother had been sick. She warned the teacher that Rick might be sleepy, because the whole family had spent the night in the hospital's waiting room. It was like everyone in town was having an unlucky night. Andy worried all day, and then decided there was only one thing to do. After school, Andy didn't go home. Instead he rode his bicycle to the untraveled edge of the neighborhood. Empty fields surrounded him, and the silenced consumed him. There were no kids playing ball, or parents calling out to their kids. There was just one thing: the massive house of the woman who was said to have forty cats. Could it really be true? And then he heard rustling at his feet. A cat was rubbing his leg. And behind it were five more cats. More cats peered from under the house, and more peeked around its corner. Suddenly, there were dozens and dozens of cats, all scampering towards Andy: white cats, grey cats, tabbies, and more! The yard filled with cats, all approaching and meowing. And the meowing cats could surely be heard inside the house. Suddenly, the door swung open like an oven. \"What are you doing to my cats?\" a voice shouted. Andy looked up to see a big woman with short black hair, and a very disturbed face. First he was scared, and then startled, as he whispered his response: “My name's Andy.” The woman looked, confused, as Andy continued, “I lost my cat.” “And you thought I stole him?” the woman said, defensively. “I came to check,” Andy said, honestly. \"Come inside,\" she said. Andy wasn't sure that he should. “My name's Edith,” her voice softened, “and I don’t scratch.” Andy smiled uncomfortably. “I love cats,” she said, melodically. “People always think I have stolen theirs. But, I just have a lot of cats.” Just then, he heard a car pulling up in the street behind him. Andy turned to see a man getting out, wearing an expensive suit. He had neatly-trimmed hair, dark sunglasses that didn’t rest quite right on his nose, and he was listening to the voicemail on his cellphone. Edith smiled, and introduced Andy: “Now here's a man who really likes cats.” The man stared at the ocean of cats surrounding Andy, scanning each one as though appraising them for an auction. Edith said proudly, “Meet a local celebrity, the man behind all those cat food commercials. Meet Joshua Sellers.” Joshua nodded with pride, still eying the cats in her yard. “I found some of my most-talented cats in this very yard. And now they're national TV stars!” Andy looked around. Beneath the cats, he could see the “lawn,” which Andy mentally redefined as “clumps of grass,” surrounded by wide patches of dirt. It seemed strange that nationally-acclaimed-cats could come from such a poorly-painted house. Andy saw a cage at the side of the yard. No cat would be happy in a cage for very long, but he knew that a cage was sometimes necessary; he used a kennel to transport Muggles to his doctor appointments. The cage was on top of yesterday’s free copy of the newspaper. Edith must have been reading Andy’s mind, he though. “I don't read the newspaper,” she sighed. “And I haven't used that cage for months, either. My precious cats hate being cooped up!” Mr. Sellers seemed a little disappointed that they weren't paying more attention to his career. “I just discovered an amazing cat,” he said excitedly. “I just flew to New York to appear on the David Letterman show, and I took the cat with me to impress him!” Andy couldn't help but wonder if the cat's trick was chasing foil. Mr. Sellers returned to his cellphone. “I've got 13 unheard voicemail messages,” he exclaimed. “Lucky 13!” He'd been so busy flying to New York yesterday morning, he'd forgotten to check his voicemail — until an hour ago, when he got back to the city. “I've got a story you can tell David Letterman,” said Andy. “Tell him I've figured out who's stealing the neighborhood's cats!”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Edith; (b) Joshua Sellers; (c) Muggles; (d) Rick",
      "answer": "(a) Edith",
      "outcome": "“It makes it hard to trust people when they steal your pet. I even suspected my friend Rick — until I realized that he'd spent the night at the hospital, and couldn't possibly have taken it.”\n“Are you sure your cat didn't run away?” Edith asked.\n“My mom wondered the same thing,”Andy admitted. “But even Rick knew that my cat couldn’t climb the fence around our back yard.”\n“Do you really know who stole the cat?” asked Mr. Sellers.\n“You're a likely suspect,” Andy told him firmly. “But you wouldn't have had time. You flew to New York yesterday morning and didn't return until an hour ago.”\n“You're accusing me, aren't you!” said Edith. “I told you I haven't touched my cage for months!”\n“Then how did the cage get on top of yesterday's newspaper?” Andy confirmed that the newspaper under the cage had yesterday's date. And looking inside the cage, Andy saw a crumpled piece of foil.\nEdith looked down sadly, and then began to cry. “I'd heard all the children talking about your wonderful cat. I love cats so much. And when I get lonely... I guess I do bad things.”\n“What a story,” said Mr. Sellers. “Maybe I can get you on the David Letterman show!”\nAndy shook his head. “All I want is my cat.”\nBy the end of the day, Muggles was back home with Andy, and all the other cats in the neighborhood had been returned to their rightful owners. Andy realized he didn't need the world to know how special his cat was.\nBecause he already knew that himself."
