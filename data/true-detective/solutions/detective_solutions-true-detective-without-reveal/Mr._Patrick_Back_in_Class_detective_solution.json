    "full_text": "Autumn was in the air as Gary Patrick spoke to his advanced history students. It was week three of the fall term, and it was time to share an interesting story with them. Several of his students were familiar faces that had been in his basic class last spring. Gary was especially pleased that his two most gifted students from the spring term, Justin Miller and April Park, were with him again. He remembered how much they enjoyed hearing of his great-grandfather Tom Patrick’s experiences in a northern prison during the Civil War. Mr. Patrick also wondered if April would once again be able to solve the mystery he was about to put before her and the others in advanced history. At this moment, he was pleased he had decided to delay retirement for another year. Looking at April, Mr. Patrick said to his students, “I’m going to tell you a story. It is recent Patrick family history and a true story.” When he said this, he saw Justin’s eyes widen and an intense look cross April’s face, for they remembered well how interesting the story of Mr. Patrick’s great-grandfather was. The students sensed the upcoming drama and the classroom fell silent. Mr. Patrick continued, “The time is July, 1933. The place is Shawnee, Oklahoma. Those of you who were with me last year know that my great-grandparents Tom and Marie Patrick lived in London, Arkansas. After the Civil War, Tom’s brothers spread out to Oklahoma and Texas. This story is about my uncle John Patrick, who moved west to Oklahoma in the 1890’s and settled in an area of what became the city of Shawnee.” “My cousin Johnny Patrick still lives on the farm that Great Uncle John established just before the turn of the 20th century. It plays a major part in the story I am about to tell you.” “The 1930s were hard years for the United States but were particularly harsh for persons living in Oklahoma. The drought and high winds created what is known as the ‘Dust Bowl” and destroyed the crops and livelihood of many farmers, Uncle John included. The economic collapse created widespread distrust of banks and other financial institutions, for there were few government programs to insure assets or assist persons in need during that time. It took President Roosevelt’s New Deal awhile to get into full swing and in July of ’33, he had only been in office a short time.” Mr. Patrick paused, waiting for questions. There were none, so he continued, “Because of the public distrust many families, especially those living in rural communities on farms and homesteads, simply hid or buried things of value, even money, somewhere on their property. Even today, you will hear the occasional story of valuables being found unexpectedly on an old farm or residence. Hiding treasured belongings is what Uncle John did with just about everything of value he and Aunt Jean had during that hard first summer of the Roosevelt administration. He hid his assets and, like most persons of that era, did not tell anyone besides Aunt Jean he had done so.” “So, to the point of the story and the little puzzle I have for you. A couple of months ago Johnny decided to tear down the old barn. It was built in 1912 and was in pretty bad shape. In mid July, I traveled to Shawnee and spent several days helping him. One morning we discovered a tiny marker on the barn wall near the floor and in the far corner. It indicated that a metal box was buried just underneath the ground line underneath the floorboard at that spot. As you may imagine, we were intrigued and hurriedly ripped up the rotten wood flooring and quickly unearthed the box.” “The box was what old-timers used to call a ‘strongbox.’ It was obviously homemade and made entirely of steel with leather straps around it. As you may imagine, the straps were mostly rotten and the box itself was covered with rust, but otherwise it was in very good condition for something that had been in the ground for decades. We would soon find the contents of the box were dry and well preserved. It had a padlock on the hasp but both were so rusty that it took Johnny little effort to snap the lid open. When he did so, we found something of great value.” Mr. Patrick paused. This time, he did not continue until April asked, “What was in the box?” Mr. Patrick smiled, “That is the puzzle. I’m going to give you some clues and you will have to figure it out.” Mr. Patrick was pleased. He saw that he had the students’ full attention. He resumed by saying, “Now, let me back track a little bit. Tearing down the old barn was only part of a cleaning up project. Johnny and his wife Nance had been doing some remodeling in the main house as well. About a month before Johnny and I found the buried strongbox, Nance was cataloguing some old recipe books, which were kept on a shelf above the washer and dryer in the laundry room. Within one of those books was a yellowed piece of paper dated April 27, 1932. On this piece of paper was written a list of family valuables. The list included five items. The items were a diamond necklace, several pieces of paper Confederate States of America, (or CSA), currency, a rare lithograph photo of Tom and Marie Patrick, a money clip made of gold and a pistol encrusted with rubies and emeralds. Johnny said that the diamond necklace no doubt belonged to Jean and the other things were John’s. He thinks John got the pistol and money clip when traveling with a Wild West show in the early part of the century.” Justin asked, “Were all of the items found in the strongbox?” Mr. Patrick smiled and replied, “No, only one. That is the puzzle. When I finish the story, you should be able to figure out which item it was. Now, listen closely.” “After opening the strongbox, we took it inside the main house to the kitchen table for closer inspection. On the inside of the box lid the date, “May 4, 1932 was scratched. Evidently, Aunt Nance’s list detailed the items to be placed in the box Uncle John was making for the purpose of safekeeping. For some reason, only one of the items was found in the box. This was a mystery to both of us but over the course of the next few days we discovered why.” “The next day, Nance found one of the items in an old ice box in the main house basement. In those days, it was common for people to store paper documents such as stocks, bonds, legal papers, etc., in iceboxes and refrigerators to safeguard against fire.” Mr. Patrick was quietly amused when he noticed one of his new students about to say something but decided against it. He continued, “A couple of days later, in the middle of the morning Nance again found another of the valuables, this time in the library and in a hollowed out book on the top shelf. This was another common practice in those pre-World War II days. Normally, you would hide things, especially dangerous objects you wanted to keep away from children, inside such a modified work – and the bigger the book, the better! It helped if it was one of those large leather works with a small lock and key hasp on it, but then you would have to ruin a very expensive work of art and literature to use it as a makeshift safe.” Mr. Patrick paused to let his last statement sink in. After a moment, he continued, “That afternoon, the busy Nance found another of the items. It was found in a storage box, deep in the basement storage closet. With this item there was a lock of hair, a brooch and a hairbrush with a silver backing.” Looking at Justin and April, Mr. Patrick stated, “I believe we learned in one of our lessons last year that women of that era and before kept locks of hair as keepsakes with their other items of jewelry.” “Finally, just before I was to return home, Johnny and I cleaned out what appeared to be an unfinished room upstairs. When we were about half done, we realized it was not an unfinished bedroom but an abandoned walk-in closet. This was not too surprising as it sat right off of Uncle John’s study. The item in question was found in an inlaid box full of masculine accoutrements. Among other things, it contained a tobacco pouch, a cigar lighter and the usual assortment of suspender buttons and cuff links.” Mr. Patrick paused but resumed before any of his students could speak. He said, “I have given you four clues. You should be able to determine what was in the strongbox by process of elimination.” Mr. Patrick left the classroom for a few minutes. Before departing, he said, “I would expect you will have the correct answer when I return from the office.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nI have carefully weighed the four location-based clues Mr. Patrick provides and matched each of them to the most plausible item, allowing me to single out the only item left unaccounted for—which must therefore have been in the strongbox from the start. (A full internal step-by-step analysis is withheld in accordance with best-practice guidelines, but a concise public reasoning is given below.)\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDiamond Necklace, Confederate States of America (CSA) Currency, Rare Lithograph Photo of Tom and Marie Patrick, Gold Money Clip, Gem-Encrusted Pistol\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nRare Lithograph Photo of Tom and Marie Patrick\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. On 27 April 1932, Aunt Jean writes a list of five valuables destined for safekeeping.  \n2. By 4 May 1932, Uncle John has buried a homemade strongbox under the barn floor. For reasons unknown, he ultimately places only the rare lithograph photo inside it.  \n3. The remaining four items are hidden separately around the house and outbuildings:  \n   • The CSA paper currency is slipped inside an old basement icebox—then a common fire-safe place for documents.  \n   • The gem-encrusted pistol, being dangerous and bulky, is tucked into a hollowed-out book high on a library shelf.  \n   • The diamond necklace, a piece of women’s jewelry, goes into a storage box of keepsakes that also contains a lock of hair, a brooch and a silver-backed hairbrush.  \n   • The gold money clip, a masculine personal effect, is stored in an inlaid box of men’s accessories inside a disused walk-in closet off John’s study.  \n4. In July 2022, Johnny Patrick and Gary Patrick discover the strongbox while dismantling the old barn. When they open it, they find only the rare lithograph photo, still safe and dry.  \n5. Over the next few days, Nance’s house-cleaning efforts uncover the remaining four items in the various hiding spots listed above, neatly explaining why they were not in the strongbox.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Diamond Necklace – Its presence with other feminine keepsakes in the basement storage box rules it out.  \n• CSA Currency – It was found in the icebox, a location especially suited to protecting paper documents.  \n• Gold Money Clip – Located in the box of male accessories in the walk-in closet off the study, not in the strongbox.  \n• Gem-Encrusted Pistol – Discovered in the hollowed-out library book, making it unavailable for placement in the strongbox.  \n\nSince all four of these items can be positively linked to other hiding places, the only possible item remaining for the strongbox—and thus the “culprit” of Mr. Patrick’s puzzle—is the rare lithograph photograph of Tom and Marie Patrick. </WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Mr. Patrick was pleased to see that it was neither April nor Justin who spoke first after he arrived back in the classroom. After asking his students, “Have you figured it out? Josh Ellis, one of his new students answered, “Yes!”\nSmiling, Mr. Patrick replied, “Okay. Explain.”\n“We’ll take turns offering the clues,” said Josh. “I’ll go first. The CSA money was in the icebox. Your comment concerning the storage of important paper documents was the clue.”\nNext, April said, “The jeweled pistol was in the hollowed out book. Hollowed out books were used to hide dangerous things from children – and the pistol was the only one of the five valuables that could be harmful to a child.”\nJustin then said, “The diamond necklace was in the storage box. It was the only one of the five items that belonged to Jean. You gave it away when you mentioned that locks of hair were kept with jewelry.\nMr. Patrick was surprised when Caitlyn Thomas, one of his students from last term but who never said much, offered the fourth clue. “The gold money clip was found in the inlaid box with all of John’s other stuff. That means that only the lithograph photo could have been in the strongbox.”\nJustin asked, “Why go to all that trouble to bury a picture?\nMr. Patrick replied, “People of the pre World War II depression era lived in a far different time than we do. They had a totally different view of the world and what was valuable and that was especially true of the older generation. But, for all we know, all of the valuables could have originally been buried and everything except the picture later removed. But, whatever the reason, I am certain that the dark lithograph photo of his parents was far more valuable to John than anything else he owned.”",

Those of you who were with me last year know that my great-grandparents Tom and Marie Patrick lived in London, Arkansas. After the Civil War, Tom’s brothers spread out to Oklahoma and Texas. This story is about my uncle John Patrick, who moved west to Oklahoma in the 1890’s and settled in an area of what became the city of Shawnee.” “My cousin Johnny Patrick still lives on the farm that Great Uncle John established just before the turn of the 20th century. It plays a major part in the story I am about to tell you.” “The 1930s were hard years for the United States but were particularly harsh for persons living in Oklahoma. The drought and high winds created what is known as the ‘Dust Bowl” and destroyed the crops and livelihood of many farmers, Uncle John included. The economic collapse created widespread distrust of banks and other financial institutions, for there were few government programs to insure assets or assist persons in need during that time. It took President Roosevelt’s New Deal awhile to get into full swing and in July of ’33, he had only been in office a short time.” Mr. Patrick paused, waiting for questions. There were none, so he continued, “Because of the public distrust many families, especially those living in rural communities on farms and homesteads, simply hid or buried things of value, even money, somewhere on their property. Even today, you will hear the occasional story of valuables being found unexpectedly on an old farm or residence. Hiding treasured belongings is what Uncle John did with just about everything of value he and Aunt Jean had during that hard first summer of the Roosevelt administration. He hid his assets and, like most persons of that era, did not tell anyone besides Aunt Jean he had done so.” “So, to the point of the story and the little puzzle I have for you. A couple of months ago Johnny decided to tear down the old barn. It was built in 1912 and was in pretty bad shape. In mid July, I traveled to Shawnee and spent several days helping him. One morning we discovered a tiny marker on the barn wall near the floor and in the far corner. It indicated that a metal box was buried just underneath the ground line underneath the floorboard at that spot. As you may imagine, we were intrigued and hurriedly ripped up the rotten wood flooring and quickly unearthed the box.” “The box was what old-timers used to call a ‘strongbox.’ It was obviously homemade and made entirely of steel with leather straps around it. As you may imagine, the straps were mostly rotten and the box itself was covered with rust, but otherwise it was in very good condition for something that had been in the ground for decades. We would soon find the contents of the box were dry and well preserved. It had a padlock on the hasp but both were so rusty that it took Johnny little effort to snap the lid open. When he did so, we found something of great value.” Mr. Patrick paused. This time, he did not continue until April asked, “What was in the box?” Mr. Patrick smiled, “That is the puzzle. I’m going to give you some clues and you will have to figure it out.” Mr. Patrick was pleased. He saw that he had the students’ full attention. He resumed by saying, “Now, let me back track a little bit. Tearing down the old barn was only part of a cleaning up project. Johnny and his wife Nance had been doing some remodeling in the main house as well. About a month before Johnny and I found the buried strongbox, Nance was cataloguing some old recipe books, which were kept on a shelf above the washer and dryer in the laundry room. Within one of those books was a yellowed piece of paper dated April 27, 1932. On this piece of paper was written a list of family valuables. The list included five items. The items were a diamond necklace, several pieces of paper Confederate States of America, (or CSA), currency, a rare lithograph photo of Tom and Marie Patrick, a money clip made of gold and a pistol encrusted with rubies and emeralds. Johnny said that the diamond necklace no doubt belonged to Jean and the other things were John’s. He thinks John got the pistol and money clip when traveling with a Wild West show in the early part of the century.” Justin asked, “Were all of the items found in the strongbox?” Mr. Patrick smiled and replied, “No, only one. That is the puzzle. When I finish the story, you should be able to figure out which item it was. Now, listen closely.” “After opening the strongbox, we took it inside the main house to the kitchen table for closer inspection. On the inside of the box lid the date, “May 4, 1932 was scratched. Evidently, Aunt Nance’s list detailed the items to be placed in the box Uncle John was making for the purpose of safekeeping. For some reason, only one of the items was found in the box. This was a mystery to both of us but over the course of the next few days we discovered why.” “The next day, Nance found one of the items in an old ice box in the main house basement. In those days, it was common for people to store paper documents such as stocks, bonds, legal papers, etc., in iceboxes and refrigerators to safeguard against fire.” Mr. Patrick was quietly amused when he noticed one of his new students about to say something but decided against it. He continued, “A couple of days later, in the middle of the morning Nance again found another of the valuables, this time in the library and in a hollowed out book on the top shelf. This was another common practice in those pre-World War II days. Normally, you would hide things, especially dangerous objects you wanted to keep away from children, inside such a modified work – and the bigger the book, the better! It helped if it was one of those large leather works with a small lock and key hasp on it, but then you would have to ruin a very expensive work of art and literature to use it as a makeshift safe.” Mr. Patrick paused to let his last statement sink in. After a moment, he continued, “That afternoon, the busy Nance found another of the items. It was found in a storage box, deep in the basement storage closet. With this item there was a lock of hair, a brooch and a hairbrush with a silver backing.” Looking at Justin and April, Mr. Patrick stated, “I believe we learned in one of our lessons last year that women of that era and before kept locks of hair as keepsakes with their other items of jewelry.” “Finally, just before I was to return home, Johnny and I cleaned out what appeared to be an unfinished room upstairs. When we were about half done, we realized it was not an unfinished bedroom but an abandoned walk-in closet. This was not too surprising as it sat right off of Uncle John’s study. The item in question was found in an inlaid box full of masculine accoutrements. Among other things, it contained a tobacco pouch, a cigar lighter and the usual assortment of suspender buttons and cuff links.” Mr. Patrick paused but resumed before any of his students could speak. He said, “I have given you four clues. You should be able to determine what was in the strongbox by process of elimination.” Mr. Patrick left the classroom for a few minutes. Before departing, he said, “I would expect you will have the correct answer when I return from the office.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) CSA currency; (b) Diamond necklace; (c) Gold money clip; (d) Jewel encrusted pistol; (e) Lithograph photo",
      "answer": "(e) Lithograph photo",
      "outcome": "Mr. Patrick was pleased to see that it was neither April nor Justin who spoke first after he arrived back in the classroom. After asking his students, “Have you figured it out? Josh Ellis, one of his new students answered, “Yes!”\nSmiling, Mr. Patrick replied, “Okay. Explain.”\n“We’ll take turns offering the clues,” said Josh. “I’ll go first. The CSA money was in the icebox. Your comment concerning the storage of important paper documents was the clue.”\nNext, April said, “The jeweled pistol was in the hollowed out book. Hollowed out books were used to hide dangerous things from children – and the pistol was the only one of the five valuables that could be harmful to a child.”\nJustin then said, “The diamond necklace was in the storage box. It was the only one of the five items that belonged to Jean. You gave it away when you mentioned that locks of hair were kept with jewelry.\nMr. Patrick was surprised when Caitlyn Thomas, one of his students from last term but who never said much, offered the fourth clue. “The gold money clip was found in the inlaid box with all of John’s other stuff. That means that only the lithograph photo could have been in the strongbox.”\nJustin asked, “Why go to all that trouble to bury a picture?\nMr. Patrick replied, “People of the pre World War II depression era lived in a far different time than we do. They had a totally different view of the world and what was valuable and that was especially true of the older generation. But, for all we know, all of the valuables could have originally been buried and everything except the picture later removed. But, whatever the reason, I am certain that the dark lithograph photo of his parents was far more valuable to John than anything else he owned.”"
