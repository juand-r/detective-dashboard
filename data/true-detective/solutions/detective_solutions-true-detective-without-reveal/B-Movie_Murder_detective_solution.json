    "full_text": "Detective Cheryl Barnes and her partner Robert Simmons marched onto the set of \"Alien Invaders,\" a low-budget movie being filmed at a rented house in the Hollywood Hills. Cheryl looked at several alien costumes lying across a lawn chair and shuddered. “Boy these things are scary.” Robert nodded. “Yeah. I think my goose bumps have goose bumps.” The police were called when Clifford Lang, one of the actors, died in his trailer. The medical examiner removed the body and determined that poison had entered his system just before eight in the morning. Robert walked around the lot, while Cheryl examined Clifford’s trailer. In front of it lay a carpet that was immaculate, even though it was on the street. After a few moments, Cheryl walked inside the house and looked for the director of the film, Sal Digby. She found him in the kitchen. On the table beside Sal was a bag of herbs and vitamins. “Hello Mr. Dibgy. I’m Detective Barnes. I understand you were the first person to find Mr. Lang's body. Can you describe the circumstances?\" “Sure.” He opened up a bottle and swallowed a Vitamin C capsule. “All the actors were on set by eight this morning -- except Clifford. I found it odd because usually he was right on time. When he didn't show after ten minutes, I ran over to his trailer and knocked on the door. He didn't answer so I used my master key.” Sal swallowed another pill. \"I felt terrible when I saw him. He lay on the floor, next to a script -- his face white. I didn’t touch him.” Sal rubbed his hands together. “I don’t like to touch anything because I get sick very easily. It looked like he had passed away so I called Angela to take his pulse.” Sal felt his brow. “Is it hot in here?” Cheryl shook her head. Sal looked through his bag for something else and then gave up. \"There's a rumor that Mr. Lang and his leading lady didn't get along.\" The director shook his head. \"Not true. Angela is actually quite a nice person. She used to be a nurse. \"And Lang?” Sal began again to look in his bag. “If I can be honest here, he was kind of a prima donna. He made us cover the ground in front of his trailer with a rug so he wouldn’t get his fancy shoes dirty. Then he told us to make sure it’s cleaned at the end of each day.” He pulled out another bottle of pills. “Got it.” \"So with Lang out of the picture what happens with the movie?\" \"We'll do some re-filming and add a few computer tricks.\" Cheryl nodded. “I’d like to speak to Angela.” A few moments later, Cheryl sat in a dimly lit trailer across from the weeping blonde-haired actress. \"The murder occurred around eight. Can you tell me where you were at that time?” “Yes,” she said, wiping her eyes. “I had just sat down in a chair outside the house.\" \"Can anyone verify that?” \"Yeah, Sal could.” \"The story is that you disliked Lang. Care to elaborate?\" \"Actually, that's not true. We only tried to make it seem that way. In reality, we were...involved.\" Angela stood up and picked up a stack of letters from her table. \"These are love letters he wrote me.” She sniffed Cheryl raised her eyebrows. \"So why put on the charade?\" \"If people knew, it could leak out and end up splashed across the tabloids.\" \"I see,\" Cheryl said, glancing at the letters. \"He's thanking you here for your help. What did you do for him?\" \"Everything. He was diabetic. He would eat anything and everything and it was starting to show in his weight. I tried to help him as much as I could.\" When Cheryl walked outside, she noticed a man setting up a camera just outside the house. Cheryl showed him her credentials and asked his name. “Tom.” “Are you the only cameraman?” “On this cheapo-shoot? Yeah. They were supposed to have an indoor camera guy and outdoor one. But they didn’t have the budget, so I have to do both. Have to take all my equipment inside the house, then outside. Geez.” “How well did you know Mr. Lang?” “Very well. I hated the man. I shot two other pictures with him. Wouldn’t have done this one, but I needed the dough.” “Why didn’t you like him?” “He would always yell at me saying that I didn’t get his good side, or I didn’t keep the camera running during his ‘great’ adlibs. Geez.” “Can you account for your whereabouts at the time of the murder?” “Yeah, sure,” he said, adjusting a few levers on his camera. “It happened this morning, right? Well, at about seven-thirty, I took a walk in the park across the road to clear my head.” “What time did you get back?” “About eight.” Tom looked at all the dirt on his shoes. “Geez, this place is one horror story after another.” As Cheryl ambled back to the house, she noticed a young girl with horn-rimmed glasses exiting Angela’s trailer. \"Miss, can I speak to you for a moment? I’m...\" \"I know you're that detective, aren’t you? Word travels fast on a movie set.” \"You are?\" \"Debbie, the director's assistant. At least, that's my title. Basically, I'm a gopher.\" \"Where were you at eight this morning?\" \"I had just left Clifford’s trailer after giving him coffee. I know because I checked my watch to see if I was on schedule. He seemed fine then.” “What else do you do here?” “Sometimes, I have to track down things for the staff. Like on Tuesday, I had to get Sal some herbs from the health food store. And yesterday, Angela asked me to get her some Dragon Fruit. It’s a delicacy from Indonesia.” \"Why?” “She wanted to give it to Clifford. She told me it would help control his blood sugar.” “One final question. Why is a smart girl like you working as a gopher?\" \"For the connections. I'm going to be an actress.\" She smiled, showing off perfect white teeth. Clifford said he'd introduce me to some big-wigs.\" At that moment, Cheryl’s partner, Robert, walked over to her. \"Any luck?” “Yeah, I now know whose telling the truth and who's just acting.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Time of death  \n   • The medical examiner fixed the moment the poison entered Clifford Lang’s body at “just before eight in the morning.”  \n   • Therefore the killer had to get the poison into Lang a few minutes before 8 a.m.\n\n2. The carpet in front of the trailer  \n   • Lang insisted the carpet be laid down so he would not dirty his expensive footwear.  \n   • It was always vacuumed at the end of every shooting day, so by the next morning it should already have shown at least normal overnight dust and, after the bustle of a murder investigation, plenty of footprints.  \n   • Yet Cheryl finds it “immaculate,” i.e. no one has stepped on it since it was cleaned the previous evening.\n\n3. Statements that contradict the carpet’s condition  \n   • Debbie (the director’s assistant) says she took a cup of coffee to Lang and left the trailer at exactly 8 a.m.  \n        – She could not have reached the door without stepping on the rug, and her shoes would have left some trace.  \n   • Tom, the cameraman, returns from a walk through the park at 8 a.m. with visibly muddy shoes, yet the rug is spotless, proving he never approached the trailer.  \n   • No one else claims to have been near the trailer that morning.\n\n4. Debbie’s motive and opportunity  \n   • Motive: she was counting on Lang to give her an introduction to “big-wigs.” When that prospect vanished (Lang was threatening to quit the picture, the script hints at his prima-donna habits, and Debbie has already been doing menial errands for everyone) she had reason to resent him.  \n   • Opportunity: as the self-styled “gopher” she routinely fetched food, coffee and, significantly, herbs and vitamins. She had easy access to any number of toxic substances from the health-food store trip she herself mentions.  \n   • Because the carpet is still clean, her claim that she delivered coffee at 8 a.m. must be false. She was never there at that time, which means she is lying about her whereabouts. A lie about the crucial five-minute window is the clearest indicator of guilt.\n\n5. Why the others do not fit the evidence  \n   • Sal Digby (director): has a master key, but he was inside the house with the rest of the crew until Lang’s absence was noticed. Angela says she was in sight of the house and saw Sal there; Sal corroborates her presence.  \n   • Angela (actress, ex-nurse): outwardly looks suspicious because of medical knowledge, but she is on set by 8 a.m., which Sal confirms, and she had tried to help Lang with his diabetes.  \n   • Tom (cameraman): loudly hated Lang, but that muddy-shoe clue shows he never set foot on the pristine carpet.\n\n6. Logical deduction  \n   • Only one person both had access to Lang just before 8 a.m. and is proven to be lying about it: Debbie.  \n   • She slipped the poison into something she knew Lang would ingest before coming out of his trailer (very likely coffee), sometime shortly before 7:50 a.m., and then carefully avoided stepping on the carpet again.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSal Digby, Angela (actress), Tom (cameraman), Debbie (director’s assistant)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nDebbie (director’s assistant)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Before shoot-call, around 7:45 a.m., Debbie brings Clifford his customary morning coffee.  \n• Knowing he always gulps it down while reading the day’s script, she has laced it with a fast-acting poison she purchased during an earlier “herb-run” to the health-food store.  \n• Lang drinks the coffee; the poison takes effect “just before eight,” and he collapses on the trailer floor.  \n• Debbie leaves, taking the coffee cup with her so no one will see it, and stays away from the trailer, avoiding the carpet so that it remains perfectly clean.  \n• At 8 a.m. the rest of the cast is ready; Lang’s absence is noticed.  \n• Around 8:10 a.m. Sal unlocks the trailer, finds Lang dead, and the police are called.  \n• Debbie later pretends she delivered coffee exactly at eight (giving herself a false alibi) but that claim is destroyed by the spotless carpet—which proves no one trod to the trailer after the previous night’s cleaning.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSal Digby: although he had a master key, multiple witnesses place him in the house at 8 a.m., and nothing ties his vitamins to Lang’s poisoning. His germ-phobia explains—but does not incriminate—his behaviour with pills.  \nAngela: Sal corroborates her presence outside the house at 8 a.m.; her nursing background was used to help Lang control his diabetes, not harm him. The “public feud” was only an invented publicity ploy.  \nTom the Cameraman: openly disliked Lang, but the mud on his shoes and the immaculate carpet prove he never approached the trailer. His alibi of walking in the park fits both the physical evidence and the timeline.  \nOnly Debbie’s lies and opportunity match the facts, leaving her as the sole murderer.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

So who did it?”\n“Angela.”\n“Angela?”\n“Yes, she used to be a nurse so she would know about poisons. Using one of Cliff's insulin hypodermics, she injected poison into the Dragon Fruit. Angela left the fruit on Cliff's table, knowing that he would eat it. Clifford had never tasted this fruit before so he wouldn't notice the poison taste.

Geez.” “Can you account for your whereabouts at the time of the murder?” “Yeah, sure,” he said, adjusting a few levers on his camera. “It happened this morning, right? Well, at about seven-thirty, I took a walk in the park across the road to clear my head.” “What time did you get back?” “About eight.” Tom looked at all the dirt on his shoes. “Geez, this place is one horror story after another.” As Cheryl ambled back to the house, she noticed a young girl with horn-rimmed glasses exiting Angela’s trailer. \"Miss, can I speak to you for a moment? I’m...\" \"I know you're that detective, aren’t you? Word travels fast on a movie set.” \"You are?\" \"Debbie, the director's assistant. At least, that's my title. Basically, I'm a gopher.\" \"Where were you at eight this morning?\" \"I had just left Clifford’s trailer after giving him coffee. I know because I checked my watch to see if I was on schedule. He seemed fine then.” “What else do you do here?” “Sometimes, I have to track down things for the staff. Like on Tuesday, I had to get Sal some herbs from the health food store. And yesterday, Angela asked me to get her some Dragon Fruit. It’s a delicacy from Indonesia.” \"Why?” “She wanted to give it to Clifford. She told me it would help control his blood sugar.” “One final question. Why is a smart girl like you working as a gopher?\" \"For the connections. I'm going to be an actress.\" She smiled, showing off perfect white teeth. Clifford said he'd introduce me to some big-wigs.\" At that moment, Cheryl’s partner, Robert, walked over to her. \"Any luck?” “Yeah, I now know whose telling the truth and who's just acting.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Angela; (b) Debbie; (c) Sal; (d) Tom",
      "answer": "(a) Angela",
      "outcome": "Robert smiled at Cheryl. “From what you’ve said, I think I have this one figured out.”\n“You do?”\n“Yes, Sal is the murderer, of course. He was the first one to find the body. He would have had plenty of time to poison Clifford.”\n“Yes, he might have had time. But he’s a hypochondriac and wouldn’t have wanted to touch any poison.”\n“Okay, what about Debbie. She went into Clifford’s trailer every morning to bring him coffee. She could have done something then.”\nCheryl nodded. “That’s probably true, but she wanted to be an actress and Clifford said he would introduce her to some people. She wouldn’t have wanted to ruin that connection.”\nRobert took a deep breath. “What about Tom? He said he hated Clifford.”\n“Yes, but Tom’s shoes were dirty. So if he had gone into Clifford’s trailer this morning, there would be mud all over the carpet. But it’s clean as a whistle.”\nRobert grimaced. “I give up. So who did it?”\n“Angela.”\n“Angela?”\n“Yes, she used to be a nurse so she would know about poisons. Using one of Cliff's insulin hypodermics, she injected poison into the Dragon Fruit. Angela left the fruit on Cliff's table, knowing that he would eat it. Clifford had never tasted this fruit before so he wouldn't notice the poison taste. I believe she did it because she was tired of taking care of Clifford.\nRobert nodded. “There’s only one thing scarier than aliens. That’s your crime-solving abilities.”\nCheryl smiled."
