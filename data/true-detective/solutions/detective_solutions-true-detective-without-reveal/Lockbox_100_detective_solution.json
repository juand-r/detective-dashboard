    "full_text": "Robert Caldwell always looked forward to the fourth Monday of each month. This was when the Mystery Club of the Caldwell and Zielny law firm met to discuss the next mystery challenge. The club was made up of himself, his partner, Peter Zielny, and several young attorneys who were salaried employees. This month, it was Robert’s turn to come up with a mystery challenge. As there were now six members within this group of mystery lovers, Robert knew that he would not have to do this again for several months. So, as his fellow group members entered the firm’s spacious conference room for the meeting, he was pleased with the mystery he had devised for this month. Robert greeted each member warmly with a smile and firm handshake. Coffee, soft drinks and club sandwiches awaited them as the meeting began. He began by saying, “For this month’s mystery challenge, we are going to do something different. We’re not going to participate in a whodunit, as we often do. And we’re not going to discuss a true crime mystery. Rather, this month we will act out our own mystery study right here in our own office.” This captured the attention of the group. Ronald Finch, the youngest and newest employee of Caldwell and Zielny, asked, “So what are we going to do?” Robert smiled. “One of you is going to deposit an item within lockbox 100.” Everyone knew what Robert meant when he mentioned lockbox 100. Within the offices of Caldwell and Zielny, which took up an entire floor of a downtown high-rise office building, there was a commercial vault with safe deposit boxes. The vault in the law office was not as heavy or secure as one would find in a bank, but it was larger in size. Many of the firm’s clients preferred to store valuable legal documents there. “Now, all of you know that the vault is in view of my office. The only thing is -- I can’t see everything inside of the vault because of the narrow doorway. Box 100 is on the left, out of view, and currently vacant. The mystery challenge is this: One of you must place the item within lockbox 100 during working hours when I am in my office. It must be done before close of business this Friday. It will be for you to decide who will do this and the challenge is for me to determine, by our next meeting, who has placed the item in the box.” Russell Winwood, an attorney for the firm who was scheduled to become a full partner within the next few weeks, asked, “What is the item?” “The item can be anything you can fit into the box,” answered Robert. “In case you don’t know, box 100 is a four inch by six inch box – and you are aware that our vault contains boxes as small as 3 x 5 inches and a couple as large as two feet by three feet – safes within a safe where we can store a client’s larger valuables temporarily.” “Anything else we should know?” “The only other requirement is that the chosen person must leave his name written on a piece of paper with the item for verification. Once more, the person placing the item must do it when I am in my office, so that I may see him enter and exit.” Robert placed a lockbox key on the table and said, “Here is the key to box 100. Before leaving, determine the item and the person for our mystery. The challenge starts tomorrow when I arrive for work.” The next morning was Tuesday, so Robert knew that one of his friends would be placing the unknown item into lockbox 100 before close of business Friday. He settled on this mystery in part because he had a light workload and would be able to monitor closely who entered the vault. As you would expect in a busy law office, all of the attorneys entered the vault for one reason or another several times during the week. By 6:00 p.m. Friday, the office had cleared out and he mentally recapped several of the week’s observations. Robert’s full attention was on the mystery. He thought, on Tuesday, Peter had entered the vault with a client. The client’s lockbox was one of those on a sidewall not visible from the doorway and Robert’s view. The client carried a vanilla folder with papers inside and Peter was coatless, carrying only the firm’s key to the lockbox. Later on Tuesday, Robert had seen Edward Frates enter the vault. Edward carried a big duffel bag with him, and upon leaving the vault, he carried only a pencil in his right hand. Robert reflected that on Wednesday, James Madigan entered the vault with a client. His telephone rang as he was observing them and he took his eye off of the vault for a few critical moments. When he looked back up, James and the client were exiting the vault. On Thursday, Robert recalled, as he sipped on a Coke and snacked on peanut butter crackers, Ronald and Russell had both been in the vault. Just after lunch, Russell had approached the vault with Jane Arens, his administrative assistant and asked her to wait at the door while he entered. Russell had his suit coat on and carried a briefcase. While watching the vault, Peter had come to the door of his office and asked a question about a pending legal case. They finished their short conversation just before Robert saw Russell leave the vault with Jane. Ronald had visited the vault later in the day, shortly before closing time. He was alone, and turned right when in the vault, removing himself from Robert’s view. He was in there a long time but finally exited a few minutes after closing time. Robert made a mental note to ask Ronald what he was doing in there so long if he were not the person placing the item. Robert sat at his desk quite a while recalling what he had seen during the week. As he chewed on his last cheese cracker, the answer came to him. Smiling to himself, he knew he was ready for the next monthly meeting of the Caldwell & Zielny Mystery Club.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  First I made a list of the six members of the Mystery Club:\n   • Robert Caldwell – organiser / observer, therefore not a possible culprit.  \n   • Peter Zielny  \n   • Edward Frates  \n   • James Madigan  \n   • Russell Winwood  \n   • Ronald Finch  \n\n   One of the last five must be the person who put the item in lock-box 100.\n\n2.  I asked myself what the group had to accomplish.  \n   • The chosen person had to get to box 100 while Robert was in his office and could see the vault entrance.  \n   • He had to open the box with the special key, slip in the article and a sheet with his signature, lock the box again and leave without Robert’s noticing what had happened.  \n   • Because Robert’s office looks directly at the vault door, the culprit really needed two things: (a) a reason for going into the vault, and (b) a distraction that would make Robert take his eyes off the vault at just the critical moment.\n\n3.  I went through the week day by day, looking for (a) who had the opportunity to use the key, and especially (b) who had a distraction that was clearly PLANNED instead of accidental.\n\n   • TUESDAY – Peter (with a client) and Edward (alone with a big duffel-bag) entered the vault.  \n     – Peter had no distraction; Robert watched him the whole time.  \n     – Edward also had no distraction; Robert watched him go in with a huge bag (far too large for the 4×6-inch box) and come out without it.  \n     Both visits were done under Robert’s continuous gaze; too risky for the group to have chosen either man for the job.\n\n   • WEDNESDAY – James entered with a client, and Robert’s telephone happened to ring.  \n     The ring was pure chance – something the group could not be sure would happen.  The plan called for a guaranteed distraction, not blind luck; therefore James is very unlikely to have been the designated man.\n\n   • THURSDAY (after lunch) – Russell entered the vault with his assistant, Jane, who waited in the doorway.  \n     AT THE SAME MOMENT Peter Zielny came to Robert’s office door and began asking questions about a pending case, obliging Robert to turn away from the vault.  \n     That is the only occasion all week when TWO club members were in precisely the right positions to co-operate: one inside the vault with the key and the other deliberately blocking Robert’s line of sight.  \n     The distraction wasn’t accidental; it was clearly staged.\n\n   • THURSDAY (near closing) – Ronald entered by himself, turned right (box 100 is to the left) and stayed a long time, but no one distracted Robert.  Too exposed.\n\n   • FRIDAY – No relevant visit is mentioned before Robert drew his conclusions.\n\n4.  From those observations two facts stand out:\n   (i)  The only deliberate, pre-arranged distraction occurred while Russell was inside the vault;  \n   (ii)  The only club member standing in Robert’s doorway during that distraction was Peter, Russell’s close friend and partner, who could be relied on to play the part of “decoy”.\n\n   Robert therefore reasoned that the members must have chosen Russell Winwood to place the article, with Peter acting as his confederate.  All the other possibilities either involved no distraction (so Robert would have seen the culprit unlock the left-hand wall) or depended on an unpredictable event (the phone call).\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPeter Zielny, Edward Frates, James Madigan, Russell Winwood, Ronald Finch\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nRussell Winwood\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOn Monday, after Robert left the key on the conference-room table, the Mystery Club decided that Russell Winwood would be the one to carry out the assignment.  Because Robert’s desk looks straight at the vault door, they knew Russell would need a sure-fire distraction.  The simplest plan was to use another member.\n\nOn Thursday, just after lunch, Russell took the keyed brief-case that held the small object to be deposited and walked to the vault, bringing his assistant Jane along so that his presence there would look like routine firm business.  As soon as Russell disappeared through the doorway, Peter appeared at Robert’s office door with a question he could easily have asked at any other time.  While Robert turned away to consult a file and answer Peter, Russell unlocked box 100 on the left-hand wall, placed the article and the slip with his signature inside, relocked the box and walked out.  By the time Robert looked back, Russell was already leaving the vault exactly as though nothing unusual had happened.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Peter Zielny – acted only as the decoy; Robert kept him in sight the whole time on Tuesday, and on Thursday he never entered the vault at all.  \n• Edward Frates – went in carrying a duffel-bag much too large for a 4×6-inch box and was under Robert’s continuous observation; no planned distraction.  \n• James Madigan – the only thing that shielded him was a random telephone call; the club could not have relied on chance.  \n• Ronald Finch – turned right on entering the vault (box 100 is to the left) and had no accomplice to block Robert’s view; Robert watched him almost the entire time.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Robert was so excited that he asked the club members to meet after work the following Monday instead of waiting until next month’s scheduled meeting. They readily agreed. He commenced the meeting by stating, “I know who placed the item.”\nPeter asked, “What is it?”\nRobert replied, “I don’t know. I’m only required to know who placed it and I know who that person is.” Looking at the guilty party, he smiled and said, “It was you!”\nThe guilty one grinned back and said, “Explain.”\nRobert began by saying, “Well, it was indeed a challenge watching the vault all week. But, I stayed in the office late Friday and thought it through. Here are my conclusions:\n“On Tuesday, Peter entered the vault with a client. He escaped my view for a moment, but he was with a client and did not have his jacket on. The only thing he carried with him was the key to the lockbox, so it could not have been him for those reasons. Edward also entered the vault on Tuesday. He carried what appeared to be a duffel bag in with him, but did not have it when he came out. Obviously, he placed it in one of the temporary safes for a client. For sure, it would not fit in a four by six inch lockbox. I also know that James was in the vault with a client on Wednesday. Although I was on the telephone for part of the time he was in there, I know he would not be working our mystery challenge with a client by his side. I also know that Ronald was in the vault by himself just before closing time on Thursday. However, when entering, he turned right – away from lockbox no. 100 to the left.”\nEveryone now stared at Russell. All were smiling as Robert said, “So, it was you. I’m anxious to see what you placed in the box.”\n“Why are you so sure it was me who placed the item? You are going to look foolish if you are wrong.”\n“I’m not wrong. I’ve eliminated everyone else for the reasons stated. Besides, you entered wearing a suit coat and carrying a briefcase. You had ample room to hide an item. Plus, I strongly suspect that Peter helped you. He just happened to come to my office with a question while you were in the vault.”\nThe six men went to the vault and Robert opened lockbox 100 with the firm’s spare key. He found a small box of cheese crackers. A note inside read: Robert, Enjoy the crackers. You’ve earned them! Good job. -Russell Winwood",

As he chewed on his last cheese cracker, the answer came to him. Smiling to himself, he knew he was ready for the next monthly meeting of the Caldwell & Zielny Mystery Club.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Edward Frates; (b) James Madigan; (c) Peter Zielny; (d) Ronald Finch; (e) Russell Winwood",
      "answer": "(e) Russell Winwood",
      "outcome": "Robert was so excited that he asked the club members to meet after work the following Monday instead of waiting until next month’s scheduled meeting. They readily agreed. He commenced the meeting by stating, “I know who placed the item.”\nPeter asked, “What is it?”\nRobert replied, “I don’t know. I’m only required to know who placed it and I know who that person is.” Looking at the guilty party, he smiled and said, “It was you!”\nThe guilty one grinned back and said, “Explain.”\nRobert began by saying, “Well, it was indeed a challenge watching the vault all week. But, I stayed in the office late Friday and thought it through. Here are my conclusions:\n“On Tuesday, Peter entered the vault with a client. He escaped my view for a moment, but he was with a client and did not have his jacket on. The only thing he carried with him was the key to the lockbox, so it could not have been him for those reasons. Edward also entered the vault on Tuesday. He carried what appeared to be a duffel bag in with him, but did not have it when he came out. Obviously, he placed it in one of the temporary safes for a client. For sure, it would not fit in a four by six inch lockbox. I also know that James was in the vault with a client on Wednesday. Although I was on the telephone for part of the time he was in there, I know he would not be working our mystery challenge with a client by his side. I also know that Ronald was in the vault by himself just before closing time on Thursday. However, when entering, he turned right – away from lockbox no. 100 to the left.”\nEveryone now stared at Russell. All were smiling as Robert said, “So, it was you. I’m anxious to see what you placed in the box.”\n“Why are you so sure it was me who placed the item? You are going to look foolish if you are wrong.”\n“I’m not wrong. I’ve eliminated everyone else for the reasons stated. Besides, you entered wearing a suit coat and carrying a briefcase. You had ample room to hide an item. Plus, I strongly suspect that Peter helped you. He just happened to come to my office with a question while you were in the vault.”\nThe six men went to the vault and Robert opened lockbox 100 with the firm’s spare key. He found a small box of cheese crackers. A note inside read: Robert, Enjoy the crackers. You’ve earned them! Good job. -Russell Winwood"
