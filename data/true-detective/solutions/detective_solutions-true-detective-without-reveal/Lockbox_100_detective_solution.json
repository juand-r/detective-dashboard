    "full_text": "Robert Caldwell always looked forward to the fourth Monday of each month. This was when the Mystery Club of the Caldwell and Zielny law firm met to discuss the next mystery challenge. The club was made up of himself, his partner, Peter Zielny, and several young attorneys who were salaried employees. This month, it was Robert’s turn to come up with a mystery challenge. As there were now six members within this group of mystery lovers, Robert knew that he would not have to do this again for several months. So, as his fellow group members entered the firm’s spacious conference room for the meeting, he was pleased with the mystery he had devised for this month. Robert greeted each member warmly with a smile and firm handshake. Coffee, soft drinks and club sandwiches awaited them as the meeting began. He began by saying, “For this month’s mystery challenge, we are going to do something different. We’re not going to participate in a whodunit, as we often do. And we’re not going to discuss a true crime mystery. Rather, this month we will act out our own mystery study right here in our own office.” This captured the attention of the group. Ronald Finch, the youngest and newest employee of Caldwell and Zielny, asked, “So what are we going to do?” Robert smiled. “One of you is going to deposit an item within lockbox 100.” Everyone knew what Robert meant when he mentioned lockbox 100. Within the offices of Caldwell and Zielny, which took up an entire floor of a downtown high-rise office building, there was a commercial vault with safe deposit boxes. The vault in the law office was not as heavy or secure as one would find in a bank, but it was larger in size. Many of the firm’s clients preferred to store valuable legal documents there. “Now, all of you know that the vault is in view of my office. The only thing is -- I can’t see everything inside of the vault because of the narrow doorway. Box 100 is on the left, out of view, and currently vacant. The mystery challenge is this: One of you must place the item within lockbox 100 during working hours when I am in my office. It must be done before close of business this Friday. It will be for you to decide who will do this and the challenge is for me to determine, by our next meeting, who has placed the item in the box.” Russell Winwood, an attorney for the firm who was scheduled to become a full partner within the next few weeks, asked, “What is the item?” “The item can be anything you can fit into the box,” answered Robert. “In case you don’t know, box 100 is a four inch by six inch box – and you are aware that our vault contains boxes as small as 3 x 5 inches and a couple as large as two feet by three feet – safes within a safe where we can store a client’s larger valuables temporarily.” “Anything else we should know?” “The only other requirement is that the chosen person must leave his name written on a piece of paper with the item for verification. Once more, the person placing the item must do it when I am in my office, so that I may see him enter and exit.” Robert placed a lockbox key on the table and said, “Here is the key to box 100. Before leaving, determine the item and the person for our mystery. The challenge starts tomorrow when I arrive for work.” The next morning was Tuesday, so Robert knew that one of his friends would be placing the unknown item into lockbox 100 before close of business Friday. He settled on this mystery in part because he had a light workload and would be able to monitor closely who entered the vault. As you would expect in a busy law office, all of the attorneys entered the vault for one reason or another several times during the week. By 6:00 p.m. Friday, the office had cleared out and he mentally recapped several of the week’s observations. Robert’s full attention was on the mystery. He thought, on Tuesday, Peter had entered the vault with a client. The client’s lockbox was one of those on a sidewall not visible from the doorway and Robert’s view. The client carried a vanilla folder with papers inside and Peter was coatless, carrying only the firm’s key to the lockbox. Later on Tuesday, Robert had seen Edward Frates enter the vault. Edward carried a big duffel bag with him, and upon leaving the vault, he carried only a pencil in his right hand. Robert reflected that on Wednesday, James Madigan entered the vault with a client. His telephone rang as he was observing them and he took his eye off of the vault for a few critical moments. When he looked back up, James and the client were exiting the vault. On Thursday, Robert recalled, as he sipped on a Coke and snacked on peanut butter crackers, Ronald and Russell had both been in the vault. Just after lunch, Russell had approached the vault with Jane Arens, his administrative assistant and asked her to wait at the door while he entered. Russell had his suit coat on and carried a briefcase. While watching the vault, Peter had come to the door of his office and asked a question about a pending legal case. They finished their short conversation just before Robert saw Russell leave the vault with Jane. Ronald had visited the vault later in the day, shortly before closing time. He was alone, and turned right when in the vault, removing himself from Robert’s view. He was in there a long time but finally exited a few minutes after closing time. Robert made a mental note to ask Ronald what he was doing in there so long if he were not the person placing the item. Robert sat at his desk quite a while recalling what he had seen during the week. As he chewed on his last cheese cracker, the answer came to him. Smiling to himself, he knew he was ready for the next monthly meeting of the Caldwell & Zielny Mystery Club.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  First I listed every member of the Mystery Club who could have carried out the assignment:\n   • Peter Zielny   • Edward Frates   • James Madigan   • Russell Winwood   • Ronald Finch  \n   (Robert Caldwell himself set the problem, so he is not a “culprit”.)\n\n2.  I reminded myself of the two absolute conditions Robert had laid down:\n   A.  The object (plus a slip with the offender’s name) had to be placed in 4\"×6\" lock-box 100\n       while Robert was in his office and before close of business on Friday.  \n   B.  The only way to open that box is with the key Robert placed on the table Monday\n       afternoon; therefore, whoever actually placed the item must have taken that key\n       away from the Monday meeting.\n\n3.  I rewound Robert’s week, noting what each attorney was carrying when he went into the\n    vault and when he came back out.\n\n    • Peter (Tue.): Coatless, holding only the firm’s key to a client’s box; exited in the\n      same condition.  No container for a second key and no writing instrument appeared.\n\n    • Edward (Tue. later): Entered with a large duffel-bag.  When he came back he no longer\n      had the bag – the only thing in his hand was a PENCIL.\n\n    • James (Wed.): Entered with a client; Robert’s ringing telephone distracted him for\n      “a few critical moments”, then James re-appeared still with the client and otherwise\n      empty-handed.  Nothing changed in what James was carrying.\n\n    • Russell (Thu. just after lunch): Took a brief-case into the vault, left with the same\n      brief-case; no new or discarded object in view.  Jane, his secretary, merely waited\n      at the doorway.\n\n    • Ronald (Thu. just before closing): Entered alone, turned right (box 100 is on the\n      left), and stayed so long that he did not re-emerge until a few minutes after\n      closing time.  He was still carrying exactly what he had carried in – nothing that\n      could have been the required key or a writing implement.\n\n4.  The key fact that jumps out is the pencil in Edward Frates’s hand.  \n    • Whoever put the item in box 100 had to leave a sheet of paper with his own name on\n      it – which almost certainly had to be written inside the vault.  Of the five suspects\n      the only one whom Robert ever saw leave the vault with a writing instrument that he\n      had not possessed on the way in was Edward.  \n    • Moreover, Edward went in with a bulky container (the duffel-bag) that would let him\n      smuggle in both the small 4\"×6\" “mystery object” and the key without arousing\n      curiosity.  After he had unloaded the small parcel into box 100 and locked it, he no\n      longer needed the duffel-bag, so he simply put the empty bag into one of the firm’s\n      many larger boxes and walked away with the pencil he had used.\n\n5.  The other four lawyers give Robert no comparable indication that they had either (a) a\n    key they had taken from Monday’s meeting or (b) a pen/pencil they used inside the\n    vault.  The lone, conspicuous pencil in Edward’s hand is therefore the single piece\n    of physical evidence that ties any one of them to the deposit.\n\n6.  No accomplice is necessary.  Edward could carry the key, the object, the blank slip of\n    paper and the pencil all in the duffel-bag, do the deed in total privacy, arrange his\n    belongings as he wished in one of the firm’s larger boxes and walk out looking\n    perfectly innocent – except for the pencil that Robert’s sharp eye noticed.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPeter Zielny, Edward Frates, James Madigan, Russell Winwood, Ronald Finch\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nEdward Frates\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly Tuesday afternoon Edward Frates picked up the key to lock-box 100 (taken from the\nMonday meeting) and slipped it, together with a small object of his choosing, a blank\n3\"×5\" card and a pencil, into a large duffel-bag.  By using the bag he was able to walk\npast Robert’s office without showing anything that might look suspicious.\n\nInside the vault he first opened the vacant larger box that he normally uses for client\ndocuments and placed the duffel-bag itself in that box to get it out of sight.  He next\nunlocked box 100, took the little mystery object from the duffel, wrote “Edward Frates”\non the card with the pencil, laid both item and card inside box 100 and locked it again.\n\nBecause the object was now in place, the pencil had served its only purpose; Edward kept\nit in his hand as he walked back to his office.  That pencil – the one tangible sign that\nany writing had gone on in the vault – is what later triggered Robert’s realisation.\n\nNo one else entered the vault with a fresh writing instrument, no one else came out with\none, and none of the other visits show any change in what the attorney was carrying.  The\nonly person whose outward appearance revealed that anything new had happened inside the\nvault was Edward Frates, and that is how Robert identified him as the depositor.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Peter Zielny was never seen with anything but a single client key; more importantly,\n  nothing he carried into the vault was different when he came out.\n\n• James Madigan was accompanied by a client during his entire visit, and he likewise had\n  no container or writing instrument that appeared or disappeared.\n\n• Russell Winwood carried a brief-case both in and out and had Jane merely stand at the\n  doorway; Robert noticed no item added or removed, nor any writing implement.\n\n• Ronald Finch turned right (box 100 is on the left) and stayed in the vault after\n  closing time; that alone violated the “during business hours” rule, which tells Robert\n  he cannot be the successful depositor.\n\nOnly Edward Frates both (i) changed what he was carrying (the duffel-bag vanished) and\n(ii) displayed a brand-new writing instrument on the way out – exactly what a person who\nhad just written his name for identification inside box 100 would do.  Hence the other\nsuspects are cleared, and Edward stands as the sole, self-evident culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

His telephone rang as he was observing them and he took his eye off of the vault for a few critical moments. When he looked back up, James and the client were exiting the vault. On Thursday, Robert recalled, as he sipped on a Coke and snacked on peanut butter crackers, Ronald and Russell had both been in the vault. Just after lunch, Russell had approached the vault with Jane Arens, his administrative assistant and asked her to wait at the door while he entered. Russell had his suit coat on and carried a briefcase. While watching the vault, Peter had come to the door of his office and asked a question about a pending legal case.

    "reveal_text": "Robert was so excited that he asked the club members to meet after work the following Monday instead of waiting until next month’s scheduled meeting. They readily agreed. He commenced the meeting by stating, “I know who placed the item.”\nPeter asked, “What is it?”\nRobert replied, “I don’t know. I’m only required to know who placed it and I know who that person is.” Looking at the guilty party, he smiled and said, “It was you!”\nThe guilty one grinned back and said, “Explain.”\nRobert began by saying, “Well, it was indeed a challenge watching the vault all week. But, I stayed in the office late Friday and thought it through. Here are my conclusions:\n“On Tuesday, Peter entered the vault with a client. He escaped my view for a moment, but he was with a client and did not have his jacket on. The only thing he carried with him was the key to the lockbox, so it could not have been him for those reasons. Edward also entered the vault on Tuesday. He carried what appeared to be a duffel bag in with him, but did not have it when he came out. Obviously, he placed it in one of the temporary safes for a client. For sure, it would not fit in a four by six inch lockbox. I also know that James was in the vault with a client on Wednesday. Although I was on the telephone for part of the time he was in there, I know he would not be working our mystery challenge with a client by his side. I also know that Ronald was in the vault by himself just before closing time on Thursday. However, when entering, he turned right – away from lockbox no. 100 to the left.”\nEveryone now stared at Russell. All were smiling as Robert said, “So, it was you. I’m anxious to see what you placed in the box.”\n“Why are you so sure it was me who placed the item? You are going to look foolish if you are wrong.”\n“I’m not wrong. I’ve eliminated everyone else for the reasons stated. Besides, you entered wearing a suit coat and carrying a briefcase. You had ample room to hide an item. Plus, I strongly suspect that Peter helped you. He just happened to come to my office with a question while you were in the vault.”\nThe six men went to the vault and Robert opened lockbox 100 with the firm’s spare key. He found a small box of cheese crackers. A note inside read: Robert, Enjoy the crackers. You’ve earned them! Good job. -Russell Winwood",

He settled on this mystery in part because he had a light workload and would be able to monitor closely who entered the vault. As you would expect in a busy law office, all of the attorneys entered the vault for one reason or another several times during the week. By 6:00 p.m. Friday, the office had cleared out and he mentally recapped several of the week’s observations. Robert’s full attention was on the mystery. He thought, on Tuesday, Peter had entered the vault with a client. The client’s lockbox was one of those on a sidewall not visible from the doorway and Robert’s view. The client carried a vanilla folder with papers inside and Peter was coatless, carrying only the firm’s key to the lockbox. Later on Tuesday, Robert had seen Edward Frates enter the vault. Edward carried a big duffel bag with him, and upon leaving the vault, he carried only a pencil in his right hand. Robert reflected that on Wednesday, James Madigan entered the vault with a client. His telephone rang as he was observing them and he took his eye off of the vault for a few critical moments. When he looked back up, James and the client were exiting the vault. On Thursday, Robert recalled, as he sipped on a Coke and snacked on peanut butter crackers, Ronald and Russell had both been in the vault. Just after lunch, Russell had approached the vault with Jane Arens, his administrative assistant and asked her to wait at the door while he entered. Russell had his suit coat on and carried a briefcase. While watching the vault, Peter had come to the door of his office and asked a question about a pending legal case. They finished their short conversation just before Robert saw Russell leave the vault with Jane. Ronald had visited the vault later in the day, shortly before closing time. He was alone, and turned right when in the vault, removing himself from Robert’s view. He was in there a long time but finally exited a few minutes after closing time. Robert made a mental note to ask Ronald what he was doing in there so long if he were not the person placing the item. Robert sat at his desk quite a while recalling what he had seen during the week. As he chewed on his last cheese cracker, the answer came to him. Smiling to himself, he knew he was ready for the next monthly meeting of the Caldwell & Zielny Mystery Club.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Edward Frates; (b) James Madigan; (c) Peter Zielny; (d) Ronald Finch; (e) Russell Winwood",
      "answer": "(e) Russell Winwood",
      "outcome": "Robert was so excited that he asked the club members to meet after work the following Monday instead of waiting until next month’s scheduled meeting. They readily agreed. He commenced the meeting by stating, “I know who placed the item.”\nPeter asked, “What is it?”\nRobert replied, “I don’t know. I’m only required to know who placed it and I know who that person is.” Looking at the guilty party, he smiled and said, “It was you!”\nThe guilty one grinned back and said, “Explain.”\nRobert began by saying, “Well, it was indeed a challenge watching the vault all week. But, I stayed in the office late Friday and thought it through. Here are my conclusions:\n“On Tuesday, Peter entered the vault with a client. He escaped my view for a moment, but he was with a client and did not have his jacket on. The only thing he carried with him was the key to the lockbox, so it could not have been him for those reasons. Edward also entered the vault on Tuesday. He carried what appeared to be a duffel bag in with him, but did not have it when he came out. Obviously, he placed it in one of the temporary safes for a client. For sure, it would not fit in a four by six inch lockbox. I also know that James was in the vault with a client on Wednesday. Although I was on the telephone for part of the time he was in there, I know he would not be working our mystery challenge with a client by his side. I also know that Ronald was in the vault by himself just before closing time on Thursday. However, when entering, he turned right – away from lockbox no. 100 to the left.”\nEveryone now stared at Russell. All were smiling as Robert said, “So, it was you. I’m anxious to see what you placed in the box.”\n“Why are you so sure it was me who placed the item? You are going to look foolish if you are wrong.”\n“I’m not wrong. I’ve eliminated everyone else for the reasons stated. Besides, you entered wearing a suit coat and carrying a briefcase. You had ample room to hide an item. Plus, I strongly suspect that Peter helped you. He just happened to come to my office with a question while you were in the vault.”\nThe six men went to the vault and Robert opened lockbox 100 with the firm’s spare key. He found a small box of cheese crackers. A note inside read: Robert, Enjoy the crackers. You’ve earned them! Good job. -Russell Winwood"
