    "full_text": "\"I ain't no leprechaun!\" snarled Randy. \"I'm not even Irish!\" He was three feet tall, he was dressed in a green suit, and he was beginning to hate St. Patrick's Day. A crowd of children swarmed around him excitedly. \"I caught you!\" one little girl screamed. \"Now give me a pot of gold!\" \"If I had a pot of gold, I wouldn't NEED this job,\" Randy moaned. He'd been so excited when his phone rang that morning and his friend Casey offered him an acting job. But now he knew the bad news: that the audience was two hundred seven-year-olds in a grade school auditorium! \"Let me go!\" Randy pleaded. Suddenly a giant pair of hands lifted Randy from the floor. \"Don't embarrass me,\" Casey teased. \"The Mighty Casey\" was a professional wrestler on television for half of every year. But he spent the other six months appearing at schools and conventions \ntrying to earn some extra money. \"We both need the cash,\" he reminded Randy, lifting him onto his shoulder. \"So wave to the nice crowd.\" Randy laughed with Casey and, safe on his shoulder, waved down at the excited children. \"Maybe I should hand out boxes of Lucky Charms,\" Randy joked. \"This wasn't my idea,\" Casey promised him as they hurried toward the exit. \"My career is being managed by a guy named Tony. He thought I'd look even bigger standing next to you!\" \"Just get me out of here!\" Randy said through a clenched smile, still waving to the crowd. Casey waved too, one last time, as he backed through the door and rushed into the empty school hallway. He carried Randy under a banner for the grade school's football team, the Fighting Leprechauns. \"It figures,\" muttered Randy. \"I'm sorry,\" Casey apologized. \"But this could get my picture in the paper. It'd be quite a shot—you and me both dressed up and celebrating St. Patrick's Day!\" Tony had dropped them both off in front of the school's lobby this morning in his expensive sports car and promised to pick them up when they were finished. \"Can we go home now?\" Randy whined. \"We can't,\" Casey said, lifting him down to the floor. \"I promised the teachers that we'd visit their party in the teacher's lounge.\" Randy groaned and said he hoped they wouldn't think he was a leprechaun too. The children were never allowed behind the mysterious door at the end of the hall, but the school's principal, Mr. Carswell, welcomed the two men inside. The teachers had hung green streamers on the walls to help celebrate St. Patrick's Day, and a table at the end of the room was filled with snacks and punch. \"Sorry the children grabbed you,\" Mr. Carswell said sincerely to Randy. \"But our school is famous for our Fighting Leprechaun football team. They won the state grade school championship back in 1983. Their quarterback that season grew up to be a star—he played all through high school, was wooed by a Big Ten college and went on to become a professional football player. He even played in the Super Bowl.\" \"Did they call him the Fighting Leprechaun?\" Randy asked. Mr. Carswell ignored Randy and continued talking about the school's famous football team. \"I've never heard of him,\" said Casey warmly, \"but they sound like they were quite a team.\" \"Did you see the trophy from that 1983 game? It's at the top of our display case in the lobby. It's over two feet tall, and it's actually worth a lot of money. People like to collect things that remind them of that Super Bowl quarterback. To a collector, it would probably be worth fifty thousand dollars!\" \"Unfortunately, it's gone!\" shouted Mrs. Huntington. The elderly teacher had rushed in the door to the lounge, a worried look on her face. \"I was just coming from the auditorium, finishing my turn at supervising the students’ party when I noticed. Someone smashed the glass on the display case, and they've stolen the trophy!\" Everyone scrambled to the lobby only to see the school's janitor sweeping up broken glass. All the trophies were still standing on the bottom four shelves inside the tall floor-to-ceiling case. But over the top shelf, a large hole had been broken through the glass, and where the famous trophy had been, there was just an empty shelf. \"I bet I know the little devil who's behind this,\" Mr. Carswell said. \"Oh, sure. Blame the little person!\" Randy said angrily. \"Not you,\" said Mr. Carswell. \"I meant a student named Barry. He's a second-grader and the star football player on the team these days. But everyone tells him he's not as good as the 1983 quarterback, and I think he resents it. Barry's always getting into trouble.\" Casey was concerned. \"Who was the last person in this lobby?\" he asked. \"I was,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. \"All the children were already in the auditorium to see 'The Mighty Casey'. I saw the trophy in its case as I closed the auditorium's doors, just as you two came onto the stage.\" \"But what about Barry?\" Casey asked. \"Where was he this whole time?\" \"I was on duty in the auditorium just now, during the party. We teachers watch our students carefully, but an event like this it’s easy to be overwhelmed,” Mrs. Huntington said. \"It's possible that Barry slipped away. But I know I saw him in the auditorium at some point this morning.\" \"Does anyone have a key to the display case?\" Casey asked. \"I have the only key,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. Everyone was concerned about the lost trophy. \"This is the worst St. Patrick's Day party ever,\" Randy complained. But just then, he saw Tony striding down the hall. Casey's manager had finally arrived to pick them up. \"How did it go?\" Tony asked. Casey glared at him and said, \"An elementary school? You couldn't find us some place more glamorous to appear? \"You know the truth is ugly,\" Tony joked. \"I can always use more money, and if you make more appearances, I'll earn more!\" The police arrived. The whole town was anxious about the theft of their famous trophy, and local news reporters were already gathering outside, broadcasting stories about the investigation. In the next hour, the police were busy. They searched every classroom, every desk, the backstage of the auditorium, the teacher’s lounge and even Mr. Carswell's office, but they found no trace of the famous trophy. Everyone stared, discouraged, at the empty display case until suddenly Randy said something that startled them all. \"You can stop searching,\" Randy announced. \"Because I know where the trophy is.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Time–line  \n   • Tony drops Casey and Randy in the lobby – the trophy is still there.  \n   • All pupils and most staff go into the auditorium to watch “The Mighty Casey.”  \n   • Mr Carswell shuts the auditorium doors; Randy and Casey are on stage.  \n   • After the show Randy and Casey are led straight to the teachers’ lounge with Mr Carswell; they are still there when Mrs Huntington bursts in to announce the theft.  \n   • Therefore the trophy must have been taken during the very few minutes in which the auditorium doors were shut and the teachers’ lounge was occupied – i.e. while the corridors were deserted.\n\n2. Who was free at that moment?  \n   • The janitor – he was not in the auditorium or in the lounge; he is first seen already sweeping up the broken glass.  \n   • Barry (the pupil) – but a second-grader is far too short to smash a hole in the *top* of a floor-to-ceiling case, lift out a trophy more than two feet high, and then quietly disappear.  \n   • Tony – he was away in his car and did not even know the trophy was valuable until **after** the theft was discovered.  \n   • Mr Carswell, Casey, Randy, Mrs Huntington and the other teachers were all in the lounge or the auditorium and have one another for eye-witness alibis.\n\n3. Height and access  \n   • The hole was smashed in the glass *above* the top shelf; whoever took the trophy had to be tall enough to reach over six feet.  \n   • That eliminates Barry and strongly suggests an adult such as the janitor.\n\n4. The tell-tale hiding place Randy could see  \n   • When everyone hurried to the lobby, the three-foot-tall Randy was almost at eye level with the open garbage sack on the janitor’s cleaning cart.  \n   • A two-foot-tall golden football trophy concealed under a layer of loose trash would be invisible to the taller adults who only looked down on the cart – but its polished base or handles would be plainly visible from Randy’s lower angle.  \n   • That is why Randy suddenly announced, “You can stop searching, because I know where the trophy is.”\n\n5. Motive  \n   • A school janitor earns little money; the principal had just announced that collectors would pay about $50,000 for that specific trophy.  \n   • Quick smash-and-grab, hide it in the rubbish sack, wheel the cart outside after the excitement dies down – an easy theft.\n\n6. Conclusion – only one person fits *all* of the points above: the janitor.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRandy (actor), Casey (wrestler), Tony (manager), Mr Carswell (principal), Mrs Huntington (teacher), Barry (student), School Janitor\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nSchool Janitor (name not given)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nKnowing that the entire student body and teaching staff would be in the auditorium, the janitor waited until Mr Carswell closed the doors and the corridors were empty.  \nHe wheeled his cleaning cart to the trophy case, unlocked or pried its catch, then smashed the glass high up so it would look as if someone without a key had forced entry.  \nHe lifted the valuable two-foot trophy out, dropped it into the large plastic trash sack on his cart, covered it with paper waste, and immediately began sweeping up the shards so he would appear to be the helpful cleaner who had just arrived.  \nMinutes later the teachers, Randy and Casey rushed in and found him “hard at work.” Because the cart and sack looked like ordinary rubbish no one gave them a second glance—except Randy, whose low angle allowed him to glimpse the shiny object hidden inside.  \nThe janitor intended to wheel the cart outside after the commotion subsided, put the sack in his vehicle and sell the trophy, but Randy’s observation foiled the plan.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Randy and Casey were on stage, then in the lounge with witnesses; Randy is also too short to reach the trophy unaided.  \n• Mr Carswell and several teachers were likewise in the lounge together at the moment the theft occurred.  \n• Barry, a second-grader, lacked the height to smash the top of the case and remove a heavy two-foot trophy, and was being supervised in the auditorium.  \n• Tony was off-site until after the crime and had no knowledge of the trophy’s value beforehand.  \n• Mrs Huntington was in the auditorium supervising the children and is the person who raised the alarm.  \nOnly the janitor had the motive (quick profit), the opportunity (alone in the hallway), the means (adult height, cleaning cart to hide the trophy) and was found in direct contact with the crime scene when the others arrived.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

The teachers had hung green streamers on the walls to help celebrate St. Patrick's Day, and a table at the end of the room was filled with snacks and punch. \"Sorry the children grabbed you,\" Mr. Carswell said sincerely to Randy. \"But our school is famous for our Fighting Leprechaun football team. They won the state grade school championship back in 1983. Their quarterback that season grew up to be a star—he played all through high school, was wooed by a Big Ten college and went on to become a professional football player. He even played in the Super Bowl.\" \"Did they call him the Fighting Leprechaun?\" Randy asked. Mr. Carswell ignored Randy and continued talking about the school's famous football team. \"I've never heard of him,\" said Casey warmly, \"but they sound like they were quite a team.\" \"Did you see the trophy from that 1983 game? It's at the top of our display case in the lobby. It's over two feet tall, and it's actually worth a lot of money. People like to collect things that remind them of that Super Bowl quarterback. To a collector, it would probably be worth fifty thousand dollars!\" \"Unfortunately, it's gone!\" shouted Mrs. Huntington. The elderly teacher had rushed in the door to the lounge, a worried look on her face. \"I was just coming from the auditorium, finishing my turn at supervising the students’ party when I noticed. Someone smashed the glass on the display case, and they've stolen the trophy!\" Everyone scrambled to the lobby only to see the school's janitor sweeping up broken glass. All the trophies were still standing on the bottom four shelves inside the tall floor-to-ceiling case. But over the top shelf, a large hole had been broken through the glass, and where the famous trophy had been, there was just an empty shelf. \"I bet I know the little devil who's behind this,\" Mr. Carswell said. \"Oh, sure. Blame the little person!\" Randy said angrily. \"Not you,\" said Mr. Carswell. \"I meant a student named Barry. He's a second-grader and the star football player on the team these days. But everyone tells him he's not as good as the 1983 quarterback, and I think he resents it. Barry's always getting into trouble.\" Casey was concerned. \"Who was the last person in this lobby?\" he asked. \"I was,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. \"All the children were already in the auditorium to see 'The Mighty Casey'. I saw the trophy in its case as I closed the auditorium's doors, just as you two came onto the stage.\" \"But what about Barry?\" Casey asked. \"Where was he this whole time?\" \"I was on duty in the auditorium just now, during the party. We teachers watch our students carefully, but an event like this it’s easy to be overwhelmed,” Mrs. Huntington said. \"It's possible that Barry slipped away. But I know I saw him in the auditorium at some point this morning.\" \"Does anyone have a key to the display case?\" Casey asked. \"I have the only key,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. Everyone was concerned about the lost trophy. \"This is the worst St. Patrick's Day party ever,\" Randy complained. But just then, he saw Tony striding down the hall. Casey's manager had finally arrived to pick them up. \"How did it go?\" Tony asked. Casey glared at him and said, \"An elementary school? You couldn't find us some place more glamorous to appear? \"You know the truth is ugly,\" Tony joked. \"I can always use more money, and if you make more appearances, I'll earn more!\" The police arrived. The whole town was anxious about the theft of their famous trophy, and local news reporters were already gathering outside, broadcasting stories about the investigation. In the next hour, the police were busy. They searched every classroom, every desk, the backstage of the auditorium, the teacher’s lounge and even Mr. Carswell's office, but they found no trace of the famous trophy. Everyone stared, discouraged, at the empty display case until suddenly Randy said something that startled them all. \"You can stop searching,\" Randy announced. \"Because I know where the trophy is.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Barry; (b) Casey; (c) Mr. Carswell; (d) Tony",
      "answer": "(d) Tony",
      "outcome": "\"Did Barry steal it?\" Mrs. Huntington wondered.\n\"That hole in the glass was on the fifth shelf!\" Randy laughed. \"A second grader like Barry couldn't reach up that high.\"\n\"And neither could you,\" Casey teased.\n\"That's how I know!\" Randy admitted. \"It had to be a grown-up.\"\n\"Maybe Mr. Carswell stole the trophy,\" Tony suggested.\n\"But he has a key!\" Randy said. \"Mr. Carswell would've just unlocked the case, instead of breaking in. If he had replaced the trophy with a duplicate, no one would even know that he'd stolen the original!\"\n\"Maybe Casey stole the trophy,\" Mrs. Huntington said, still suspicious.\n\"But we all saw Casey speaking in the auditorium,\" Mr. Carswell pointed, \"and he was there when the trophy was stolen.\"\n\"There's one clue you all overlooked,\" Randy said with a smile. \"The police searched the entire school. So the trophy couldn't be hidden here. The thief must've been someone who could run off after stealing it.\"\n\"And someone who knew we'd all be in the auditorium for an hour,\" Randy said.\n\"Someone who was by the lobby right before it disappeared, who's hungry for money, and who's a big greedy jerk who made me wear this green suit!\" Randy said, pointing a tiny finger at Tony.\n\"No wonder you wanted me to appear at this school!\" Casey said. \"You wanted me to lure everyone to the auditorium while you snuck into the lobby!\"\n\"You can't prove that it was me!\" Tony said. But the police were already running into the parking lot, followed by the cameras of the news reporters. Casey pointed out Tony's car, and the police demanded Tony's keys. There was nothing inside, but then the police opened Tony's trunk.\nAnd there stood the famous trophy.\n\"I told you I can always use more money,\" said Tony sadly.\n\"It serves you right,\" Randy told Tony, \"for getting us such a lousy gig. But look on the bright side. I bet they'll put our picture in the newspaper now!\"\n\"There's some bad news too,\" Casey warned Randy, looking at his green suit. \"They're probably going to call you the Fighting Leprechaun!\"\n\"Oh no!\" Randy wailed, as everybody laughed."
