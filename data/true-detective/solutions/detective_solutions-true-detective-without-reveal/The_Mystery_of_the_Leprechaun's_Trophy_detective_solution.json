    "full_text": "\"I ain't no leprechaun!\" snarled Randy. \"I'm not even Irish!\" He was three feet tall, he was dressed in a green suit, and he was beginning to hate St. Patrick's Day. A crowd of children swarmed around him excitedly. \"I caught you!\" one little girl screamed. \"Now give me a pot of gold!\" \"If I had a pot of gold, I wouldn't NEED this job,\" Randy moaned. He'd been so excited when his phone rang that morning and his friend Casey offered him an acting job. But now he knew the bad news: that the audience was two hundred seven-year-olds in a grade school auditorium! \"Let me go!\" Randy pleaded. Suddenly a giant pair of hands lifted Randy from the floor. \"Don't embarrass me,\" Casey teased. \"The Mighty Casey\" was a professional wrestler on television for half of every year. But he spent the other six months appearing at schools and conventions \ntrying to earn some extra money. \"We both need the cash,\" he reminded Randy, lifting him onto his shoulder. \"So wave to the nice crowd.\" Randy laughed with Casey and, safe on his shoulder, waved down at the excited children. \"Maybe I should hand out boxes of Lucky Charms,\" Randy joked. \"This wasn't my idea,\" Casey promised him as they hurried toward the exit. \"My career is being managed by a guy named Tony. He thought I'd look even bigger standing next to you!\" \"Just get me out of here!\" Randy said through a clenched smile, still waving to the crowd. Casey waved too, one last time, as he backed through the door and rushed into the empty school hallway. He carried Randy under a banner for the grade school's football team, the Fighting Leprechauns. \"It figures,\" muttered Randy. \"I'm sorry,\" Casey apologized. \"But this could get my picture in the paper. It'd be quite a shot—you and me both dressed up and celebrating St. Patrick's Day!\" Tony had dropped them both off in front of the school's lobby this morning in his expensive sports car and promised to pick them up when they were finished. \"Can we go home now?\" Randy whined. \"We can't,\" Casey said, lifting him down to the floor. \"I promised the teachers that we'd visit their party in the teacher's lounge.\" Randy groaned and said he hoped they wouldn't think he was a leprechaun too. The children were never allowed behind the mysterious door at the end of the hall, but the school's principal, Mr. Carswell, welcomed the two men inside. The teachers had hung green streamers on the walls to help celebrate St. Patrick's Day, and a table at the end of the room was filled with snacks and punch. \"Sorry the children grabbed you,\" Mr. Carswell said sincerely to Randy. \"But our school is famous for our Fighting Leprechaun football team. They won the state grade school championship back in 1983. Their quarterback that season grew up to be a star—he played all through high school, was wooed by a Big Ten college and went on to become a professional football player. He even played in the Super Bowl.\" \"Did they call him the Fighting Leprechaun?\" Randy asked. Mr. Carswell ignored Randy and continued talking about the school's famous football team. \"I've never heard of him,\" said Casey warmly, \"but they sound like they were quite a team.\" \"Did you see the trophy from that 1983 game? It's at the top of our display case in the lobby. It's over two feet tall, and it's actually worth a lot of money. People like to collect things that remind them of that Super Bowl quarterback. To a collector, it would probably be worth fifty thousand dollars!\" \"Unfortunately, it's gone!\" shouted Mrs. Huntington. The elderly teacher had rushed in the door to the lounge, a worried look on her face. \"I was just coming from the auditorium, finishing my turn at supervising the students’ party when I noticed. Someone smashed the glass on the display case, and they've stolen the trophy!\" Everyone scrambled to the lobby only to see the school's janitor sweeping up broken glass. All the trophies were still standing on the bottom four shelves inside the tall floor-to-ceiling case. But over the top shelf, a large hole had been broken through the glass, and where the famous trophy had been, there was just an empty shelf. \"I bet I know the little devil who's behind this,\" Mr. Carswell said. \"Oh, sure. Blame the little person!\" Randy said angrily. \"Not you,\" said Mr. Carswell. \"I meant a student named Barry. He's a second-grader and the star football player on the team these days. But everyone tells him he's not as good as the 1983 quarterback, and I think he resents it. Barry's always getting into trouble.\" Casey was concerned. \"Who was the last person in this lobby?\" he asked. \"I was,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. \"All the children were already in the auditorium to see 'The Mighty Casey'. I saw the trophy in its case as I closed the auditorium's doors, just as you two came onto the stage.\" \"But what about Barry?\" Casey asked. \"Where was he this whole time?\" \"I was on duty in the auditorium just now, during the party. We teachers watch our students carefully, but an event like this it’s easy to be overwhelmed,” Mrs. Huntington said. \"It's possible that Barry slipped away. But I know I saw him in the auditorium at some point this morning.\" \"Does anyone have a key to the display case?\" Casey asked. \"I have the only key,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. Everyone was concerned about the lost trophy. \"This is the worst St. Patrick's Day party ever,\" Randy complained. But just then, he saw Tony striding down the hall. Casey's manager had finally arrived to pick them up. \"How did it go?\" Tony asked. Casey glared at him and said, \"An elementary school? You couldn't find us some place more glamorous to appear? \"You know the truth is ugly,\" Tony joked. \"I can always use more money, and if you make more appearances, I'll earn more!\" The police arrived. The whole town was anxious about the theft of their famous trophy, and local news reporters were already gathering outside, broadcasting stories about the investigation. In the next hour, the police were busy. They searched every classroom, every desk, the backstage of the auditorium, the teacher’s lounge and even Mr. Carswell's office, but they found no trace of the famous trophy. Everyone stared, discouraged, at the empty display case until suddenly Randy said something that startled them all. \"You can stop searching,\" Randy announced. \"Because I know where the trophy is.\"",

The logical deduction from the clues presented\n\nSolve the mystery.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive\n   •  Mr. Carswell – might want the $50,000 the trophy would bring, but as principal he would be the first one suspected if it disappeared.  \n   •  The janitor – could certainly use the money, but nothing in the story hints that he knew the trophy was valuable.  \n   •  Barry – is only a second-grader; the motive would be childish jealousy, not profit.  \n   •  Casey & Randy – they are at the school only to perform; no motive for the theft is shown.  \n   •  Tony – the only character who openly admits that “I can always use more money” and who jokes that “the truth is ugly.”  He is unabashedly greedy.\n\n2.  Opportunity\n   •  Everyone, including all the teachers, the principal, Randy and Casey, was in or around the auditorium from the moment Mr. Carswell closed the auditorium doors until Mrs. Huntington discovered the theft.  \n   •  The janitor was first seen only after the theft, sweeping up glass; there is no indication he had been in the lobby earlier.  \n   •  Tony, after dropping Randy and Casey off, was gone – he could come and go without anyone noticing, because the front doors of an elementary school are never locked during a school day.  During the forty-minute show the lobby was completely empty, giving him time to break the glass, grab the two-foot-high trophy, carry it outside and drive away.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / alibis\n   •  The display-case lock was intact; the glass was smashed.  If Carswell (who owns the only key) had wanted to steal the trophy he would simply have unlocked the case.  Smashing the glass would only draw attention to him.  \n   •  A second-grader (Barry) is far too short to reach a floor-to-ceiling top shelf and drag out a heavy, two-foot trophy through broken glass without standing on something.  Nothing in the lobby had been moved or overturned to serve as a stool.  \n   •  Police searched “every classroom, every desk, the backstage of the auditorium, the teacher’s lounge and even Mr. Carswell’s office” and found nothing.  The only place they did not (and legally could not) search was the inside of Tony’s sports car, parked outside.  Therefore the trophy is no longer in the building.  Only someone who left the building during the show could have got it out.\n\n4.  Deduction\n   •  The lobby was deserted for the entire length of the performance.  \n   •  The only person free to enter, take the trophy out of the building and drive off – and who had a clear cash motive – is Tony.  \n   •  When Tony returned to pick up Randy and Casey, Randy (three feet tall, eye level with the trunk lid of the low-slung sports car) could see something large and shiny under a blanket in the back.  That is why, the instant he looked at the discouraged faces around the empty case, he could say, “You can stop searching … I know where the trophy is.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTony (Casey’s manager), Mr. Carswell (principal), the janitor, Barry (second-grader), Casey, Randy, Mrs. Huntington\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTony  (no last name given in the story)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nTony drove Randy and Casey to the school in his expensive sports car, walked with them through the lobby and noticed the tall 1983 state-championship trophy gleaming on the top shelf of the display case.  A sports collector himself, he knew that anything connected with a Super-Bowl quarterback could bring thousands of dollars.\n\nAfter dropping the two performers off he circled back, parked out of sight and slipped into the now-empty lobby while the show was under way.  Not possessing the key, he smashed the glass, reached in, lifted out the two-foot-high trophy and hurried back to his car, covering the prize with a green blanket he carried in the trunk.\n\nForty minutes later, when the performance ended and the theft was discovered, the police naturally searched only the school building; Tony and his car were outside the scope of their warrant.  Tony then strolled inside to “pick up” his clients, pretending he had just arrived.  But Randy, whose eye level matched the height of the open trunk when Tony drove up, glimpsed a large, gold-colored object under the blanket and instantly understood where the missing trophy had gone.  Hence his confident announcement: “You can stop searching … I know where the trophy is.”\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Mr. Carswell had the key; smashing the glass would incriminate him unnecessarily.  He remained in full view of teachers and Randy/Casey from shortly after the show began until the theft was discovered.  \n•  The janitor was first seen only after the alarm was raised; if he had the trophy it would still have been inside the building and the police search would have found it.  \n•  Barry could not physically reach the top shelf and could not have carried a two-foot trophy out of a locked school without being seen.  \n•  Mrs. Huntington was in the auditorium supervising children until moments before she reported the crime.  \n•  Casey and Randy were on stage, then in the teachers’ lounge, never out of sight long enough to smash a case, spirit away a large trophy and hide it outside the building – and they, too, would still have the trophy inside had they taken it.  \n•  Therefore none of them had both the opportunity and the motive.  Only Tony satisfies all four tests: motive, means, opportunity and a way to remove the evidence from the scene.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It'd be quite a shot—you and me both dressed up and celebrating St. Patrick's Day!\" Tony had dropped them both off in front of the school's lobby this morning in his expensive sports car and promised to pick them up when they were finished. \"Can we go home now?\" Randy whined. \"We can't,\" Casey said, lifting him down to the floor. \"I promised the teachers that we'd visit their party in the teacher's lounge.\" Randy groaned and said he hoped they wouldn't think he was a leprechaun too. The children were never allowed behind the mysterious door at the end of the hall, but the school's principal, Mr. Carswell, welcomed the two men inside. The teachers had hung green streamers on the walls to help celebrate St. Patrick's Day, and a table at the end of the room was filled with snacks and punch. \"Sorry the children grabbed you,\" Mr. Carswell said sincerely to Randy. \"But our school is famous for our Fighting Leprechaun football team. They won the state grade school championship back in 1983. Their quarterback that season grew up to be a star—he played all through high school, was wooed by a Big Ten college and went on to become a professional football player. He even played in the Super Bowl.\" \"Did they call him the Fighting Leprechaun?\" Randy asked. Mr. Carswell ignored Randy and continued talking about the school's famous football team. \"I've never heard of him,\" said Casey warmly, \"but they sound like they were quite a team.\" \"Did you see the trophy from that 1983 game? It's at the top of our display case in the lobby. It's over two feet tall, and it's actually worth a lot of money. People like to collect things that remind them of that Super Bowl quarterback. To a collector, it would probably be worth fifty thousand dollars!\" \"Unfortunately, it's gone!\" shouted Mrs. Huntington. The elderly teacher had rushed in the door to the lounge, a worried look on her face. \"I was just coming from the auditorium, finishing my turn at supervising the students’ party when I noticed. Someone smashed the glass on the display case, and they've stolen the trophy!\" Everyone scrambled to the lobby only to see the school's janitor sweeping up broken glass. All the trophies were still standing on the bottom four shelves inside the tall floor-to-ceiling case. But over the top shelf, a large hole had been broken through the glass, and where the famous trophy had been, there was just an empty shelf. \"I bet I know the little devil who's behind this,\" Mr. Carswell said. \"Oh, sure. Blame the little person!\" Randy said angrily. \"Not you,\" said Mr. Carswell. \"I meant a student named Barry. He's a second-grader and the star football player on the team these days. But everyone tells him he's not as good as the 1983 quarterback, and I think he resents it. Barry's always getting into trouble.\" Casey was concerned. \"Who was the last person in this lobby?\" he asked. \"I was,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. \"All the children were already in the auditorium to see 'The Mighty Casey'. I saw the trophy in its case as I closed the auditorium's doors, just as you two came onto the stage.\" \"But what about Barry?\" Casey asked. \"Where was he this whole time?\" \"I was on duty in the auditorium just now, during the party. We teachers watch our students carefully, but an event like this it’s easy to be overwhelmed,” Mrs. Huntington said. \"It's possible that Barry slipped away. But I know I saw him in the auditorium at some point this morning.\" \"Does anyone have a key to the display case?\" Casey asked. \"I have the only key,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. Everyone was concerned about the lost trophy. \"This is the worst St. Patrick's Day party ever,\" Randy complained. But just then, he saw Tony striding down the hall. Casey's manager had finally arrived to pick them up. \"How did it go?\" Tony asked. Casey glared at him and said, \"An elementary school? You couldn't find us some place more glamorous to appear? \"You know the truth is ugly,\" Tony joked. \"I can always use more money, and if you make more appearances, I'll earn more!\" The police arrived. The whole town was anxious about the theft of their famous trophy, and local news reporters were already gathering outside, broadcasting stories about the investigation. In the next hour, the police were busy. They searched every classroom, every desk, the backstage of the auditorium, the teacher’s lounge and even Mr. Carswell's office, but they found no trace of the famous trophy. Everyone stared, discouraged, at the empty display case until suddenly Randy said something that startled them all. \"You can stop searching,\" Randy announced. \"Because I know where the trophy is.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Barry; (b) Casey; (c) Mr. Carswell; (d) Tony",
      "answer": "(d) Tony",
      "outcome": "\"Did Barry steal it?\" Mrs. Huntington wondered.\n\"That hole in the glass was on the fifth shelf!\" Randy laughed. \"A second grader like Barry couldn't reach up that high.\"\n\"And neither could you,\" Casey teased.\n\"That's how I know!\" Randy admitted. \"It had to be a grown-up.\"\n\"Maybe Mr. Carswell stole the trophy,\" Tony suggested.\n\"But he has a key!\" Randy said. \"Mr. Carswell would've just unlocked the case, instead of breaking in. If he had replaced the trophy with a duplicate, no one would even know that he'd stolen the original!\"\n\"Maybe Casey stole the trophy,\" Mrs. Huntington said, still suspicious.\n\"But we all saw Casey speaking in the auditorium,\" Mr. Carswell pointed, \"and he was there when the trophy was stolen.\"\n\"There's one clue you all overlooked,\" Randy said with a smile. \"The police searched the entire school. So the trophy couldn't be hidden here. The thief must've been someone who could run off after stealing it.\"\n\"And someone who knew we'd all be in the auditorium for an hour,\" Randy said.\n\"Someone who was by the lobby right before it disappeared, who's hungry for money, and who's a big greedy jerk who made me wear this green suit!\" Randy said, pointing a tiny finger at Tony.\n\"No wonder you wanted me to appear at this school!\" Casey said. \"You wanted me to lure everyone to the auditorium while you snuck into the lobby!\"\n\"You can't prove that it was me!\" Tony said. But the police were already running into the parking lot, followed by the cameras of the news reporters. Casey pointed out Tony's car, and the police demanded Tony's keys. There was nothing inside, but then the police opened Tony's trunk.\nAnd there stood the famous trophy.\n\"I told you I can always use more money,\" said Tony sadly.\n\"It serves you right,\" Randy told Tony, \"for getting us such a lousy gig. But look on the bright side. I bet they'll put our picture in the newspaper now!\"\n\"There's some bad news too,\" Casey warned Randy, looking at his green suit. \"They're probably going to call you the Fighting Leprechaun!\"\n\"Oh no!\" Randy wailed, as everybody laughed."
