    "full_text": "Barney was excited as he prepared for bed. After all, tomorrow was his favorite day of the year. For some people, it was Christmas or their birthday, but not Barney, for him, it was always April 1. He loved April Fool’s Day as he loved to play elaborate pranks on everyone that he knew. As he prepared for bed, he thought of all his planned pranks he was going to pull off tomorrow and he could hardly wait. Tomorrow was going to be a good day indeed. As he lay in bed, Barney seemed to be having the strangest of dreams. He thought he heard someone in his bedroom and then smelled ether. Then he dreamed that he was being carried out of his house and put into a car or a truck. What was strange was that he almost felt like he was living the dream, but he was not waking up. Then in his dream, he was carried somewhere and placed on a hard surface where he lay for a while. The last part of the dream was the strangest. He felt like he was moving and heard a constant clackity-clack almost like a train going over the tracks. The dream finally ended when he heard a cell phone ringing and woke up. That was when Barney realized that it was not a strange dream, but that somehow, he was sitting in a boxcar on a moving train. Meanwhile, the cell phone kept ringing, so Barney finally answered it. The voice on the other end was his good friend Fred. “Barney, you may be wondering why you are in a boxcar on a moving train. This is a payback from everyone in your life on whom you have played April Fool’s jokes over the years. We decided that it was time to play one on you. Here is what is happening. You were placed on a train that left New York City this morning at 3:00 am. The train will arrive at its destination at 10:00 am. You have until that time to determine where you are. There are five choices, with a corresponding phone number programmed into this cell phone. By 10 am, you need to call one of the five listed phone numbers. If you get the right answer and call the right number, the door to the boxcar will automatically open and you can get out. There will be a driver there ready to take you to breakfast and then take you home. However, if you dial the wrong number or if you fail to call a number by 10:00 am, you open the latch on the crate at the other end of the boxcar. In that crate are several skunks. You will then have to spend the rest of the day with the skunks. We have ensured that there are clues that will allow you to solve this mystery if you pay attention. Good luck and APRIL FOOL’s.” With that, Fred hung up. Barney was impressed that his friends would go to such great lengths. First, he tried to get his bearings. He was seated with his back up against one wall of the boxcar. From the direction of the motion, he could tell that he was facing in the direction that the train was traveling, so he was in the back of the boxcar. It was just getting light out, so he was able to see into the rest of the boxcar. Up ahead, he could see a large crate with what looked to be a clock on the top of it. That was probably the crate of skunks. He knew his friends and so he believed that they really would release a bunch of skunks into his boxcar if he did not solve the mystery. There was a chair on each side of the boxcar. The chairs were positioned so that by sitting in them, it would be possible to look out a small hole and see outside. There seemed to be something on the floor to the right of the crate, but he could not make it out as it was in the shadow of the crate. He would explore that later. Barney knew that he needed to get started, so he got up and walked to the first chair. There he saw the note taped above the wall. It said: \nHere are the potential destinations: \nPhiladelphia, PA: 94 miles Boston, MA: 216 miles Washington, DC: 229 miles Pittsburgh, PA: 339 miles Raleigh, NC: 511 miles Barney figured it was time to start looking out the peephole, so he sat down and looked out the left side. There was not much to see. Smack dab in the middle of suburbia. He could be anywhere. After a while, the train ran alongside a highway. Barney thought that if he could see all the license plates that he could figure out what state he was in. However, the cars were all going much faster than the train so he could not read the license plates. He tried watching for a little longer in the hopes he would see a highway sign, but no such luck. After a while, he decided to try the other side. As he looked out the right side of the train, Barney saw much the same things as he saw on the left side of the train. At least the scenery was a little better on this side. This side had much more greenery and was much more pleasant to look at. Maybe he would be able to find a clue from this side, so he just kept watching. After a while, a park came into view. In addition to the standard pavilions and ponds, there was a small statue of someone. Barney strained to see who it was, but alas, no luck. He was about to give up when the train came upon a biking trail. Barney tried to yell out to the people who were riding their bikes along the train, asking where he was but each time he yelled to someone, the train was well past them before they could answer back. Obviously, that was not going to help. Barney looked at the timer. He had ten minutes left to come up with an answer. Barney got up and started to pace when he stepped on something to the right of the crate; looking down, he noticed his three juggling balls. Fred obviously put them here knowing that when he truly needed to solve a problem, he always juggled. There was something about juggling these three rubber balls that allowed him to focus on a problem. Fortunately the balls had stayed here at the front of the boxcar during the entire trip. Reaching down to pick them up, he thought \"don’t fail me now\" as he started juggling. With just a minute left as the train was coming to a stop, the balls did the trick. He knew just where he was. Quickly he pulled the phone out of his pocket. Taking a deep breath of fresh air just in case, he dialed the number with thoughts of skunks running through his mind.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • The story clearly states that the stunt is “a pay-back from everyone in your life on whom you have played April Fool’s jokes over the years.”  \n   • Of all the people Barney knows, the ONLY person who positively identifies himself and speaks to Barney is Fred.  \n   • Fred is Barney’s “good friend,” so he would know how badly Barney torments people with April-Fool pranks and would be motivated to organize an elaborate counter-prank.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   • Fred evidently had access to Barney’s bedroom (he drugged him with ether), to a vehicle (to transport Barney to the freight yard), and to the rail-road company (or at least to the yard) to load the crate, the skunks, the chairs and the phone into the boxcar before the 3 a.m. departure.  \n   • None of the other names in the narrative are shown to have carried out any specific act. All the concrete, describable actions (calling Barney, knowing the contents of the car, placing the juggling balls) are attributable to Fred.\n\n3. Physical evidence / alibis  \n   • The ringing cell phone is pre-programmed with the destination numbers—proof that the caller (Fred) arranged the puzzle.  \n   • Fred knows Barney’s private habit of using juggling balls to think. Only someone very close to Barney would bother bringing them and placing them where Barney was sure to find them.  \n   • No one else supplies an alibi that would rule them in or out.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   a. Whoever gives the instructions and controls the “unlock” mechanism must be the principal planner.  \n   b. The ONLY person who fills that role in the text is Fred.  \n   c. Therefore Fred is the mastermind; any other helpers are merely accomplices following his lead.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFred Flintstone, unnamed group of Barney’s friends\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nFred Flintstone\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nUnnamed friends who helped carry Barney, load the skunks and arrange the boxcar\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Late on the night of March 31 / April 1 Fred and several of Barney’s long-suffering prank-victims sneak into Barney Rubble’s bedroom.  \n• Using ether they render Barney unconscious.  \n• They carry him to a truck, drive to a freight yard in New York City and load him—plus a crate holding skunks, two chairs, a pre-programmed cell phone, a note and Barney’s own juggling balls—into a boxcar that is scheduled to be attached to a train leaving at 3 a.m.  \n• Fred programs the phone numbers corresponding to the five possible destinations. He also rigs an automatic latch on the boxcar door that will unlock remotely when the correct number is dialed, or will open the skunk crate if no call comes or a wrong number is dialed.  \n• At about 9 a.m., with roughly an hour left, Fred calls Barney. He explains the rules, thereby starting the “game.”  \n• Barney studies the scenery, eventually recognises where he is, dials the proper number just before 10 a.m., the door unlocks, and Fred’s hired driver is waiting outside to collect him.  \n• The skunks, therefore, never leave their crate, and the elaborate April-Fool’s revenge is complete.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• The story gives no names, acts or direct statements from any other individual; they are anonymous helpers, not principal planners.  \n• Because Fred is the only character who demonstrably had motive, knowledge, access and control, the prank’s conception and execution must be attributed to him.  \n• The unnamed accomplices merely followed instructions and therefore do not qualify as the primary culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Fred answered the phone and laughed. “So, you figured it out.” “Of course I did,” said Barney. “As you said, the clues were all there, I just had to figure them out. The first clue was the shadows cast by the crate of skunks. The shadow was on the right of the crate, which meant that the sun was to the left of the train. It was the morning, so the sun had risen in the East. Therefore, we had to be going south. That eliminated Boston. It did not totally eliminate Pittsburgh, as that is somewhat south of New York. Next, the train was traveling for seven hours. The cars on the highway were passing the train easily, so the train had to be going less than 60 miles an hour. Thus, the total distance had to be less than 420 miles. That eliminated Raleigh. Since most people ride bikes at about 10 or 15 mph and the train passed them easily, I knew we traveled more than 105 miles, which eliminated Philadelphia. The question then was Washington, DC or Pittsburgh. The juggling balls were the answer. While the path from New York to Washington is pretty flat, Pittsburgh is on the other side of the Allegheny Mountains. If the train had gone up the steep slope of the mountain, the balls would have rolled to the back of the boxcar. Since they did not, we did not go over a mountain and I could eliminate Pittsburgh. Thus, it has to be Washington, DC.”",

Reaching down to pick them up, he thought \"don’t fail me now\" as he started juggling. With just a minute left as the train was coming to a stop, the balls did the trick. He knew just where he was. Quickly he pulled the phone out of his pocket. Taking a deep breath of fresh air just in case, he dialed the number with thoughts of skunks running through his mind.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Boston, MA; (b) Philadelphia, PA; (c) Pittsburgh, PA; (d) Raleigh, NC; (e) Washington, DC",
      "answer": "(e) Washington, DC",
      "outcome": "Fred answered the phone and laughed. “So, you figured it out.” “Of course I did,” said Barney. “As you said, the clues were all there, I just had to figure them out. The first clue was the shadows cast by the crate of skunks. The shadow was on the right of the crate, which meant that the sun was to the left of the train. It was the morning, so the sun had risen in the East. Therefore, we had to be going south. That eliminated Boston. It did not totally eliminate Pittsburgh, as that is somewhat south of New York. Next, the train was traveling for seven hours. The cars on the highway were passing the train easily, so the train had to be going less than 60 miles an hour. Thus, the total distance had to be less than 420 miles. That eliminated Raleigh. Since most people ride bikes at about 10 or 15 mph and the train passed them easily, I knew we traveled more than 105 miles, which eliminated Philadelphia. The question then was Washington, DC or Pittsburgh. The juggling balls were the answer. While the path from New York to Washington is pretty flat, Pittsburgh is on the other side of the Allegheny Mountains. If the train had gone up the steep slope of the mountain, the balls would have rolled to the back of the boxcar. Since they did not, we did not go over a mountain and I could eliminate Pittsburgh. Thus, it has to be Washington, DC.”"
