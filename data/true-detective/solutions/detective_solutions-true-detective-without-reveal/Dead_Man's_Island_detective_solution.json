    "full_text": "Families can be strange. Grandpa hated the sunshine, and waited eagerly for dusk. “It's too hot,” he complained bitterly. And then he told them about the treasure. “When I was 5 years old, my grandfather told me a secret,” he said, “and then insisted I make him a promise. ‘If you live past 80 years old, you can tell it to your grandchildren,’ he'd said.” Grandpa fanned himself with a magazine. “This secret has traveled 150 years. It's the story of Dead Man's Island.” Poison was rumored, or perhaps natural causes. No one knew exactly how that famous dead man came to be dead, or even who he the dead man was exactly. “It was a tiny, 120-foot island,” Grandpa said, “and with everyone knowing he'd been buried there, it was the only name they could think of!” Grandpa studied everyone carefully, like he was hoping they could unravel the mystery. “What became California belonged to Spain then,” he told his two grandchildren, “and later to Mexico, though not until 1821.” Grandpa glared at the sun. “Lonely souls came here on ships and traded barrels of food for cowhides from the local Mexican ranchers, which they sold for huge profits when they returned to the East Coast. Enormous herds of cattle roamed the flat lands. It wasn't until later that the city became Los Angeles.” But 150 years ago, a trading ship's sailor shared a secret with Grandpa's grandfather. The captain of the S.S. Charleston had buried a valuable treasure exactly 17 miles due north from the center of Dead Man's Island ― and then 17 paces east. “That night they had to set sail around South America and back to Boston; but it was a stormy night, and their ship was lost at sea. When my grandfather heard the news, he realized he was the only person alive who knew where their treasure was buried.” “Are you making this up?” Bobby challenged. “Why didn't you look for the treasure yourself?” “Because the island disappeared. I though my grandfather might've made it up, and he never gave me a good explanation. But he did tell me the island had disappeared in 1928. And he swore the treasure was nearby, less than 300 miles.” “Maybe it's in Los Angeles,” volunteered Ann, Bobby's sister. “Could be,” Grandpa replied confidently. “Up until about 80 years ago, there were maybe 900,000 people here. Nowhere near the 12 million people that are here today. Then irrigation came, and highways, and big airplane manufacturers. It'd be funny if underneath it all was a forgotten sea captain's buried treasure.” Ann wanted to find the treasure, but only to please Grandpa. Bobby was thinking of everything he could buy with a stake in a 150-year-old treasure. Soon they were asking the local librarian for her newest atlas of maps, and then studying California's coast. There were several islands near San Francisco's coast, and even one that they called Treasure Island. But San Francisco was 400 miles north, and Grandpa's grandfather had insisted that Dead Man's Island was within 300 miles. 25 miles south of San Pedro, California, they found Santa Catalina Island ― but it was over 20 miles long (and 22 miles from the coast)! They wondered if Lisa, the librarian, had given them a defective atlas. Lisa was a young college student, and she seemed eager to help them find any island within 300 miles; especially since Ann told her that if they could find Dead Man's Island, there was treasure just 17 miles north of it ― and then 17 paces east! “I've spent five years at college studying the history of California,” Lisa announced, seeming anxious to prove how knowledgeable and helpful she could be. She pulled down several books about Sacramento. But, still, they never found Dead Man's Island. When they returned to Grandpa's house, a mysterious stranger was talking to him. Grandpa did most of the talking, and the stranger looked like he'd rather keep quiet. “This is my friend Mike, and he gives boat tours to tourists,” Grandpa explained. “He's been sailing our coast for the last 15 years. So I asked him if he'd ever heard of Dead Man's Island.” Mike stared back, silently. “And he said yes!” Grandpa said. “He has a newspaper article that proves it.” They looked hopefully at Mike, who stood still and unsmiling, before walking toward his jeep. Mike returned silently with a book about the history of Los Angeles. He opened the book in front of everyone, turning to a page about the community of San Pedro. Silently, he pointed to a picture on page 128, which displayed a lonely fence traveling down a steep hill; and in the background was the ocean. No more than 120 feet long, close to the shore, was a rocky island. “Dead Man's Island, 1873,” read the picture's caption. Even though it was an hour's away, Ann insisted they go there right away. “It's gone,” Mike muttered. They dredged the harbor in 1928. They wanted to make it easier for ships to enter the port, and they dug away the entire island!” They consulted a map and identified the right location, which was just 17 miles north. “Now let's get going,” shouted Grandpa, “before this afternoon gets any hotter!” They bought four shovels, and Grandpa drove them north, following the driving instructions he'd printed out from the internet. Soon they'd found the location: a big field in back of an abandoned factory. Its high windows were dark, and it was apparent that no one worked there any more. They hoped no one would see them digging. “I'll go scope out the geography,” Mike said quickly, “while the three of you park the car.” He hopped out before anyone said anything, and Grandpa looked for a hidden parking spot. Bobby stared after Mike, wondering if he was going to steal their treasure. As soon as the car stopped, they ran to the field. It was nothing but a giant patch of dirt, at least an acre-wide, and they saw Mike bending over a deep hole towards the center. “Someone's been digging!” Mike shouted. Grandpa arrived last, carrying the four shovels, and became furious when he came upon the emptiness of the hole. “Did they beat us to the treasure?” Ann asked. Grandpa studied the hole intently. But then he began laughing and dancing. “This hole isn't deep enough!” he said. “My grandfather said the treasure was buried six feet down, and this hole is only four feet deep. The treasure's still down there, waiting for us!” Everyone stared thoughtfully for a moment before they grabbed shovels and started digging. The kids dug with an unearthed adrenaline for the rest of the afternoon. Grandpa’s arthritis made it nearly impossible for him to break the surface of the hardened dirt, but his excitement matched the others, and maybe even exceeded it. He continued to cheer and chant until Bobby struck something. It was a pouch with the faded letters, “S.S. Charleston,” branded into the leather. Below the pouch were several layers of something brittle and crumbly, like buried rubber. Grandpa, Mike, and Ann found more in every direction ― for several feet. But there was nothing else but dirt. Had someone gotten here before them and stolen the treasure? As the sun set on the four treasure hunters, Bobby suddenly announced that, not only did he know where the treasure was, he knew who'd been lying.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What exactly is the “crime” that has to be solved?  \n    Nobody is murdered; the only thing that is unquestionably wrong is that somebody is LYING in order to get the treasure for himself (and, in the process, tries to mislead the others with a planted-in-advance hole and a planted leather pouch).  \n    So the “culprit” is the person who has secretly searched for – or already taken – the treasure and is now deceiving the rest of the party.\n\n2.  Who has a motive strong enough to do that?  \n    •  Grandpa – He is the one who brings the whole story up; but neither age nor arthritis would let him sneak out, dig a four-foot hole and re-bury things.  \n    •  Ann and Bobby – They never had a chance to act alone; they are constantly with Grandpa.  \n    •  Lisa – The librarian has no clear way of knowing the precise 17-mile spot; she never leaves the library with them.  \n    •  Mike – A boat-tour skipper who has cruised “our coast for fifteen years,” knows local charts, and is the only one (apart from Grandpa) who could have located Dead Man’s Island on his own.  A treasure would be a perfect windfall for him.\n\n3.  Opportunity and suspicious behaviour:  \n    •  Mike is the ONLY outsider who suddenly “happens” to possess a book showing Dead Man’s Island.  \n    •  He insists on coming with them.  \n    •  When they reach the area he jumps out of the car first – “I’ll go scope out the geography” – giving him time to get to the hole before anyone can see what he is doing.  \n    •  He is already bending over a four-foot-deep pit and is the one who loudly announces: “Someone’s been digging!”  \n    •  A four-foot pit cannot be dug in the few seconds between his leaving the jeep and the family arriving: therefore it must have been dug earlier – logically by the same person who knew the exact spot in advance, i.e., Mike.  \n    •  Inside that pit the party finds a leather pouch marked “S.S. Charleston.”  The find is simply too neat: exactly the right ship’s name, lying only four feet down although Grandpa’s grandfather said the treasure was “six feet” deep.  That pouch is most probably a prop Mike planted beforehand to convince the others that they have now reached the “empty” hiding place.  \n\n4.  Bobby’s deduction  \n    Bobby suddenly realises two things:\n      a) They never bothered to walk the extra “17 paces east” that the captain’s directions specify.  The hole (and the planted pouch) are exactly where Mike wanted them to dig – 17 miles north of the vanished island – but NOT 17 paces east of that point.  \n      b) The one person who steered them to that exact spot, had time to prepare the hole and showed every sign of wanting them to stop searching, is Mike.  \n    Therefore Bobby knows (i) the treasure must still be 17 paces farther east and (ii) Mike is the liar who tried to misdirect them.  \n\n5.  Physical evidence that supports the conclusion  \n    •  The “four-foot” depth that contradicts the “six-foot” story.  \n    •  The impossibility of anyone else having dug that hole between the time the jeep stopped and the family reached the field.  \n    •  The leather pouch with the convenient inscription – too good to be coincidence.  \n    •  Mike’s silence and evasiveness throughout the story.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGrandpa, Mike (boat-tour skipper), Lisa (librarian), Ann, Bobby\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMike (surname not given, known only as “Mike,” skipper of a tourist boat)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Some time after Grandpa told him the family legend, Mike secretly researched the position of Dead Man’s Island, plotted a line exactly 17 miles due north, then located the stretch of waste ground behind the abandoned factory.  \n•  Before the day of the family expedition he dug a hole about four feet deep, planted an old leather pouch stamped “S.S. Charleston” together with rotted scraps of hide or rubber to make it appear that the original treasure had already been found (or had decayed), then refilled the pit loosely.  \n•  On the treasure-hunting day he accompanied the family, insured that they parked in the right place, jumped out first, reopened the loose soil and cried, “Someone’s been digging!”  \n•  His aim was simple: make the family believe the treasure had already been removed (or had disintegrated), stop any further searching and keep for himself whatever he had already recovered or planned to recover later.  \n•  What Mike did NOT anticipate was that Bobby would notice they had not yet walked the vital “17 paces east,” realise they were still standing in the wrong spot, and expose Mike’s ruse.  The real treasure therefore still lies 17 paces east of the bogus hole.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nGrandpa – too old, arthritic and physically unable to dig the four-foot hole in advance; also genuinely thrilled and surprised throughout the search.  \nAnn & Bobby – children who never left Grandpa’s presence and had no chance to stage the deception.  \nLisa – never left the library with them; had no time or means to dig or plant evidence; her only “fault” is ignorance of a now-vanished island.  \nTherefore, all circumstantial and physical evidence, as well as motive and opportunity, point exclusively to Mike.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It's the story of Dead Man's Island.” Poison was rumored, or perhaps natural causes. No one knew exactly how that famous dead man came to be dead, or even who he the dead man was exactly. “It was a tiny, 120-foot island,” Grandpa said, “and with everyone knowing he'd been buried there, it was the only name they could think of!” Grandpa studied everyone carefully, like he was hoping they could unravel the mystery. “What became California belonged to Spain then,” he told his two grandchildren, “and later to Mexico, though not until 1821.” Grandpa glared at the sun. “Lonely souls came here on ships and traded barrels of food for cowhides from the local Mexican ranchers, which they sold for huge profits when they returned to the East Coast. Enormous herds of cattle roamed the flat lands. It wasn't until later that the city became Los Angeles.” But 150 years ago, a trading ship's sailor shared a secret with Grandpa's grandfather. The captain of the S.S. Charleston had buried a valuable treasure exactly 17 miles due north from the center of Dead Man's Island ― and then 17 paces east. “That night they had to set sail around South America and back to Boston; but it was a stormy night, and their ship was lost at sea. When my grandfather heard the news, he realized he was the only person alive who knew where their treasure was buried.” “Are you making this up?” Bobby challenged. “Why didn't you look for the treasure yourself?” “Because the island disappeared. I though my grandfather might've made it up, and he never gave me a good explanation. But he did tell me the island had disappeared in 1928. And he swore the treasure was nearby, less than 300 miles.” “Maybe it's in Los Angeles,” volunteered Ann, Bobby's sister. “Could be,” Grandpa replied confidently. “Up until about 80 years ago, there were maybe 900,000 people here. Nowhere near the 12 million people that are here today. Then irrigation came, and highways, and big airplane manufacturers. It'd be funny if underneath it all was a forgotten sea captain's buried treasure.” Ann wanted to find the treasure, but only to please Grandpa. Bobby was thinking of everything he could buy with a stake in a 150-year-old treasure. Soon they were asking the local librarian for her newest atlas of maps, and then studying California's coast. There were several islands near San Francisco's coast, and even one that they called Treasure Island. But San Francisco was 400 miles north, and Grandpa's grandfather had insisted that Dead Man's Island was within 300 miles. 25 miles south of San Pedro, California, they found Santa Catalina Island ― but it was over 20 miles long (and 22 miles from the coast)! They wondered if Lisa, the librarian, had given them a defective atlas. Lisa was a young college student, and she seemed eager to help them find any island within 300 miles; especially since Ann told her that if they could find Dead Man's Island, there was treasure just 17 miles north of it ― and then 17 paces east! “I've spent five years at college studying the history of California,” Lisa announced, seeming anxious to prove how knowledgeable and helpful she could be. She pulled down several books about Sacramento. But, still, they never found Dead Man's Island. When they returned to Grandpa's house, a mysterious stranger was talking to him. Grandpa did most of the talking, and the stranger looked like he'd rather keep quiet. “This is my friend Mike, and he gives boat tours to tourists,” Grandpa explained. “He's been sailing our coast for the last 15 years. So I asked him if he'd ever heard of Dead Man's Island.” Mike stared back, silently. “And he said yes!” Grandpa said. “He has a newspaper article that proves it.” They looked hopefully at Mike, who stood still and unsmiling, before walking toward his jeep. Mike returned silently with a book about the history of Los Angeles. He opened the book in front of everyone, turning to a page about the community of San Pedro. Silently, he pointed to a picture on page 128, which displayed a lonely fence traveling down a steep hill; and in the background was the ocean. No more than 120 feet long, close to the shore, was a rocky island. “Dead Man's Island, 1873,” read the picture's caption. Even though it was an hour's away, Ann insisted they go there right away. “It's gone,” Mike muttered. They dredged the harbor in 1928. They wanted to make it easier for ships to enter the port, and they dug away the entire island!” They consulted a map and identified the right location, which was just 17 miles north. “Now let's get going,” shouted Grandpa, “before this afternoon gets any hotter!” They bought four shovels, and Grandpa drove them north, following the driving instructions he'd printed out from the internet. Soon they'd found the location: a big field in back of an abandoned factory. Its high windows were dark, and it was apparent that no one worked there any more. They hoped no one would see them digging. “I'll go scope out the geography,” Mike said quickly, “while the three of you park the car.” He hopped out before anyone said anything, and Grandpa looked for a hidden parking spot. Bobby stared after Mike, wondering if he was going to steal their treasure. As soon as the car stopped, they ran to the field. It was nothing but a giant patch of dirt, at least an acre-wide, and they saw Mike bending over a deep hole towards the center. “Someone's been digging!” Mike shouted. Grandpa arrived last, carrying the four shovels, and became furious when he came upon the emptiness of the hole. “Did they beat us to the treasure?” Ann asked. Grandpa studied the hole intently. But then he began laughing and dancing. “This hole isn't deep enough!” he said. “My grandfather said the treasure was buried six feet down, and this hole is only four feet deep. The treasure's still down there, waiting for us!” Everyone stared thoughtfully for a moment before they grabbed shovels and started digging. The kids dug with an unearthed adrenaline for the rest of the afternoon. Grandpa’s arthritis made it nearly impossible for him to break the surface of the hardened dirt, but his excitement matched the others, and maybe even exceeded it. He continued to cheer and chant until Bobby struck something. It was a pouch with the faded letters, “S.S. Charleston,” branded into the leather. Below the pouch were several layers of something brittle and crumbly, like buried rubber. Grandpa, Mike, and Ann found more in every direction ― for several feet. But there was nothing else but dirt. Had someone gotten here before them and stolen the treasure? As the sun set on the four treasure hunters, Bobby suddenly announced that, not only did he know where the treasure was, he knew who'd been lying.",

      "outcome": "“Did Mike double-cross us, and dig the holes himself? Ann asked suspiciously.\n“Even if he could dig that quickly, Grandpa had all the shovels while we were parking the car!” Bobby replied.\n“You thought Grandpa made the whole thing up,” Ann pointed out.\n“I wondered at first,” Bobby admitted reluctantly, “because Grandpa hates the heat. But he couldn't have dug the holes because of his arthritis.”\n“Maybe his own grandfather made the whole story up!” Mike said with concern.\n“There's a leather pouch from the S.S. Charleston,” Grandpa replied. “So it sounds like my grandfather was telling the truth.”\n“But one person wasn't telling the truth. Our librarian!”\n“She kept trying to give us books about cities like San Francisco,” Ann said, “which is 400 miles away ― and even landlocked Sacramento! As someone who has studied California, she must've known she was misleading us! She got here before us, and started looking for the treasure!”\n“But the joke's on her, because there is no treasure,” Bobby announced. “The sailor that Grandpa's grandfather spoke to was working on a trading ship,” he pointed out. “They carried nothing of value except barrels of food, which they traded for...”\n“Leather hides!” said Grandpa, looking down at the brittle layers of cowhide beneath him. “It was the most valuable thing that his ship carried, and at that time, it might've been worth the equivalent of maybe $40,000 today.”\n“But it spent the last 150 years decomposing into nothing,” Mike said sadly.\nAnn was disappointed, but Bobby knew exactly what to say: “After all this time, you really did find where the treasure was buried, Grandpa!”\n“And besides,” Grandpa replied, “we have something worth more than any treasure.\nEach other! And now you have a story you can tell your grandchildren. You don't even have to wait 80 years!”\n“Right!” Bobby agreed. “Now let's get out of this heat!”"
