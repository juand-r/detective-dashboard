    "full_text": "Erik’s friends began showing up for the backyard sleepover late in the afternoon. It was spring break and unseasonably warm – perfect weather for spending the night outside. Martin, Justin, Trevor and Stephen had been Erik’s best friends since grade school. They took turns spending the night in each other’s homes and, during the spring and summer months, would often engage in these all night camp outs. Tonight, the first sleepover of the year would be in Erik Taylor’s backyard. While Erik’s mother, Jenee Taylor, grilled hamburgers for the boys on the huge commercial grill beneath the covered patio, Erik began to feel nervous. He was hosting tonight’s party, and he would also be the one to solve a mystery perpetrated by his friends. After dark, one of his friends would pull a practical joke on him. Tomorrow morning, he would have to figure out what the joke was and who had been the prankster. But, for now, the friends enjoyed hamburgers and soft drinks. Erik, a skilled guitar player, serenaded his guests with favorite ballads until darkness overtook the backyard. After visiting under the moonlight until midnight, the boys began to think about breaking up for the night. Each boy had his own pup tent in the Taylor backyard. The tents were arranged as a backfield formation on a football team using the old split T offense. Erik’s tent was in front, perhaps 20 feet in front of the patio. The remaining four tents were set up in a straight line in back of him, the top of the “T,” out of his line of sight and approximately 20 feet back. As the boys prepared to call it a night, Erik reviewed the rules of the game for them. “We’ve been doing this long enough that I shouldn’t have to review the rules, but I will anyway. After we say goodnight, each of you may leave your tent once before sunrise. I may observe what you do from my tent, but I may not leave it.” Erik paused for a moment and then continued, “As you know, our backyard is very dark. There is a faint night light on the patio and there is just enough light from the streetlamp in front of our next door neighbor’s house to be able to see movement back here. It is up to me to stay alert and be able to figure out tomorrow morning what the stunt is and who did it.” The boys grinned, said goodnight to each other and headed towards their respective tents. About an hour later, Erik heard an almost inaudible noise. He looked out the flap of his tent and saw one of his friends softly open the patio door to go inside, probably to use the restroom. He could not tell who it was; his clothing was as dark as the night. However, even in the dim light he noticed his shoes were lighter than the rest of his clothing. A few minutes later, the patio door opened and the dark-clothed friend was careful to return to his tent by walking in the shadows of the stockade fence surrounding the Taylor backyard. Once he had stepped in back of Erik’s tent and line of sight, there was no way to tell who it was. Less than an hour later, Erik heard another faint noise. This time, he saw a figure step out of the shadows and onto the patio. Even though this person appeared to be wearing a white pullover shirt, he could not tell who it was because of the darkness. He did see a silhouette of a person pouring a glass of water from the picnic table and drinking it. Again, the mystery person escaped to the shadows and got behind Erik before he could identify him. Later on, around 3:00 a.m. Erik heard a faint rustling noise coming from the patio. He had dozed off and barely caught it in time. Looking out the tent flap, he saw a shadowy movement on the patio but could not determine who it was or what the figure was doing. Erik thought that, whoever it was, he was good: disciplined with quiet patience. Had he not been expecting a prank, he would never have suspected anyone in the group was up and about, much less moving around on the patio. He was sure though, that it was this unidentified friend who was pulling the prank. This prankster was away, hidden in the shadows, far longer than any of the others. Finally, Erik saw the grayish black outline of his friend creeping along the fence back to his tent. Erik knew there would be one more disturbance before daylight. Sure enough, around 4:00 a.m. Erik heard the now familiar slight rustle of a pup tent flap. As the last night- walker came dimly into view, he saw that he kept within the fence shadows as the others had, but went towards the fence gate, opened it and exited the backyard. A few minutes later, the gate reopened and the unknown chum re-entered the backyard, returning to his tent as the others had. Erik thought he saw the brief glint of a pair of eyeglasses on this person’s forehead. As Erik knew all four of his friends had taken turns outside of their respective tents, he now relaxed and decided to get a couple of hours sleep before breakfast.   Around 8:00 a.m., Jenee fixed pancakes for the boys on the outside grill. It had not taken Erik long to figure out what the prank was. His guitar was missing from its stand on the patio. Now, all he had to do was figure out who took it. There was not much discussion during breakfast. The boys were tired and hungry. It gave Erik time to think through what he had seen – and not seen – during the long dark night. Biting into a piece of bacon, he noticed that Martin was wearing a new pair of athletic shoes. Grass stains had spoiled their pristine newness and added a green tinge to the bright white leather. He also considered it odd that Stephen wore a sweat suit this morning even though it was already warm. It was not just any sweat suit. It was very expensive nylon with matching pants, a windbreaker and white shirt, all sporting the maker’s logo. His mind was racing now. Erik knew that Trevor and Stephen wore contact lenses and Justin wore glasses. As the boys finished breakfast, Erik seriously considered the situation. Think, Erik, think, he said to himself, as he knew his friends would shortly be eager for him to guess which one of them took his guitar. Erik considered what he knew about his friends, hoping he would think of something to help him solve the mystery. He recalled that Trevor was a duck hunter, used to long periods of minimal movement and silence when stalking his prey. As he studied his friend’s faces, it came to him. Without waiting for his mother to leave them, he said, “I know which one of you took my guitar.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Match each of the four nocturnal trips with what Erik was able to see in the darkness and with what the boys are wearing at breakfast.\n\n • Trip #1 (≈1 a.m.) – Person all in dark clothes except for noticeably lighter shoes.  \n  Breakfast clue: only Martin is wearing brand-new bright-white athletic shoes that are now grass-stained, so the first walker is Martin.\n\n • Trip #2 (≈2 a.m.) – Person in a white pullover shirt gets a drink of water.  \n  Breakfast clue: Stephen turns up in an expensive nylon warm-up suit that includes a white top with a logo. That pegs Stephen as the second walker.\n\n • Trip #3 (≈3 a.m.) – Shadowy figure who stays on the patio a long time, moving very quietly. No white shoes, no white shirt, no glint of glasses.  \n  Breakfast clues:  \n   – Justin is the only boy who wears glasses, so absence of a glass-glint rules him out.  \n   – Martin’s white shoes would have shown; they did not.  \n   – Stephen’s white top would have shown; it did not.  \n   – That leaves Trevor. Trevor is a duck-hunter—accustomed to sitting still and moving silently for long stretches—exactly the skills the culprit displayed.\n\n • Trip #4 (≈4 a.m.) – Person whose glasses briefly glint in the faint light, leaves the yard through the gate and returns.  \n  Breakfast clue: only Justin wears glasses, so Justin is the fourth walker.\n\n2. Since each boy is allowed only one outing, the prankster must be the boy who was out on Trip #3, the only outing long enough to steal the guitar.\n\n3. Therefore, Trevor is the only person who had both the required opportunity (the long, silent third outing) and no contradictory clothing clue.\n\n4. Motive is merely the agreed-upon game: each sleep-over someone plays a prank for Erik to solve. As an avid hunter, Trevor would relish being the “stealth” prankster this time.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMartin, Justin, Trevor, Stephen\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTrevor\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• After midnight all five boys turn in.  \n• About 1 a.m. Martin slips into the house to use the bathroom, trampling wet grass on his way back and staining his new white shoes.  \n• About 2 a.m. Stephen, thirsty, walks to the patio in his white-logo pullover, pours a glass of water, drinks, and returns to bed.  \n• About 3 a.m. Trevor quietly leaves his tent, hugs the fence line, reaches the patio and, taking advantage of his hunter’s patience and night-movement skill, lifts Erik’s guitar from its stand. He carries it back inside his own tent and conceals it, taking noticeably longer than the others.  \n• About 4 a.m. Justin, who wears glasses, pushes them up on his forehead (the flash Erik sees) and goes out the back gate—perhaps to the front yard or driveway for a brief look at the sky—then returns.  \n• At dawn the guitar is gone, breakfast is served, and Erik pieces the clues together.  \n• He identifies Trevor as the only one whose nighttime trip and clothing fit the thief’s profile.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Martin’s bright white shoes were seen on the first walker, who merely entered the house and quickly returned; the thief stayed out far longer and wore no white shoes.  \n• Stephen’s conspicuous white pullover makes him the second walker who only paused for water; the thief wore no white shirt.  \n• Justin’s eyeglasses identify him as the fourth walker, but the thief’s outing showed no glint of glasses and occurred an hour earlier.  \nThus none of them had the combination of clothing and lengthy opportunity required to remove the guitar, leaving Trevor as the sole possible culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Erik winked at the guilty party, who winked back at him. The others did not notice. The guilty one asked, innocently, “So, who took your guitar?”\nHe began speaking, forcefully like the trial lawyer he hoped one day to be. He said, “I know that it was Martin who entered the house around 1:00 a.m. to use the restroom. The light was so dim I could barely see anything, which was the idea, of course, but I was able to tell he was wearing white shoes. At no time was he near the guitar and I certainly didn’t see him touch it.” Pointing at Martin’s feet, he added, “I see they are a bit grass stained this morning, but no doubt they can be easily cleaned. We’ll do it before you go home, if you wish.” Erik continued, “It couldn’t have been Stephen, either. I saw a person at the table pour a glass of water shortly before 2:00. This person had on a white pullover shirt, the type Stephen is wearing now, and he didn’t touch the guitar. Now we are down to two suspects, Trevor and Justin. At around 4:00, I saw a person creeping along the fence to the gate. I glimpsed just for an instant moonlight on a pair of eyeglasses. Justin is the only one in our group who wears eyeglasses.”\nTrevor grinned and said, “Well done, but surely you have some reason you suspect me?”\nErik smiled back and replied, “Yes, I do. Around 3:00 I saw and heard very quiet and stealthy movements. You are a duck hunter and very capable of both. You are also the only one I cannot say for certain did not touch the guitar, because I could not see what you were doing on the patio. I’m guessing you hid it somewhere very close.” Looking around the patio, the huge grill Jenee Taylor had cooked so many delicious meals on stuck out at him like a sore thumb. He said, “Mom, be careful not to clean the grill until I retrieve my guitar. Unless I am mistaken, Trevor hid it behind the grill.”",

Martin, Justin, Trevor and Stephen had been Erik’s best friends since grade school. They took turns spending the night in each other’s homes and, during the spring and summer months, would often engage in these all night camp outs. Tonight, the first sleepover of the year would be in Erik Taylor’s backyard. While Erik’s mother, Jenee Taylor, grilled hamburgers for the boys on the huge commercial grill beneath the covered patio, Erik began to feel nervous. He was hosting tonight’s party, and he would also be the one to solve a mystery perpetrated by his friends. After dark, one of his friends would pull a practical joke on him. Tomorrow morning, he would have to figure out what the joke was and who had been the prankster. But, for now, the friends enjoyed hamburgers and soft drinks. Erik, a skilled guitar player, serenaded his guests with favorite ballads until darkness overtook the backyard. After visiting under the moonlight until midnight, the boys began to think about breaking up for the night. Each boy had his own pup tent in the Taylor backyard. The tents were arranged as a backfield formation on a football team using the old split T offense. Erik’s tent was in front, perhaps 20 feet in front of the patio. The remaining four tents were set up in a straight line in back of him, the top of the “T,” out of his line of sight and approximately 20 feet back. As the boys prepared to call it a night, Erik reviewed the rules of the game for them. “We’ve been doing this long enough that I shouldn’t have to review the rules, but I will anyway. After we say goodnight, each of you may leave your tent once before sunrise. I may observe what you do from my tent, but I may not leave it.” Erik paused for a moment and then continued, “As you know, our backyard is very dark. There is a faint night light on the patio and there is just enough light from the streetlamp in front of our next door neighbor’s house to be able to see movement back here. It is up to me to stay alert and be able to figure out tomorrow morning what the stunt is and who did it.” The boys grinned, said goodnight to each other and headed towards their respective tents. About an hour later, Erik heard an almost inaudible noise. He looked out the flap of his tent and saw one of his friends softly open the patio door to go inside, probably to use the restroom. He could not tell who it was; his clothing was as dark as the night. However, even in the dim light he noticed his shoes were lighter than the rest of his clothing. A few minutes later, the patio door opened and the dark-clothed friend was careful to return to his tent by walking in the shadows of the stockade fence surrounding the Taylor backyard. Once he had stepped in back of Erik’s tent and line of sight, there was no way to tell who it was. Less than an hour later, Erik heard another faint noise. This time, he saw a figure step out of the shadows and onto the patio. Even though this person appeared to be wearing a white pullover shirt, he could not tell who it was because of the darkness. He did see a silhouette of a person pouring a glass of water from the picnic table and drinking it. Again, the mystery person escaped to the shadows and got behind Erik before he could identify him. Later on, around 3:00 a.m. Erik heard a faint rustling noise coming from the patio. He had dozed off and barely caught it in time. Looking out the tent flap, he saw a shadowy movement on the patio but could not determine who it was or what the figure was doing. Erik thought that, whoever it was, he was good: disciplined with quiet patience. Had he not been expecting a prank, he would never have suspected anyone in the group was up and about, much less moving around on the patio. He was sure though, that it was this unidentified friend who was pulling the prank. This prankster was away, hidden in the shadows, far longer than any of the others. Finally, Erik saw the grayish black outline of his friend creeping along the fence back to his tent. Erik knew there would be one more disturbance before daylight. Sure enough, around 4:00 a.m. Erik heard the now familiar slight rustle of a pup tent flap. As the last night- walker came dimly into view, he saw that he kept within the fence shadows as the others had, but went towards the fence gate, opened it and exited the backyard. A few minutes later, the gate reopened and the unknown chum re-entered the backyard, returning to his tent as the others had. Erik thought he saw the brief glint of a pair of eyeglasses on this person’s forehead. As Erik knew all four of his friends had taken turns outside of their respective tents, he now relaxed and decided to get a couple of hours sleep before breakfast.   Around 8:00 a.m., Jenee fixed pancakes for the boys on the outside grill. It had not taken Erik long to figure out what the prank was. His guitar was missing from its stand on the patio. Now, all he had to do was figure out who took it. There was not much discussion during breakfast. The boys were tired and hungry. It gave Erik time to think through what he had seen – and not seen – during the long dark night. Biting into a piece of bacon, he noticed that Martin was wearing a new pair of athletic shoes. Grass stains had spoiled their pristine newness and added a green tinge to the bright white leather. He also considered it odd that Stephen wore a sweat suit this morning even though it was already warm. It was not just any sweat suit. It was very expensive nylon with matching pants, a windbreaker and white shirt, all sporting the maker’s logo. His mind was racing now. Erik knew that Trevor and Stephen wore contact lenses and Justin wore glasses. As the boys finished breakfast, Erik seriously considered the situation. Think, Erik, think, he said to himself, as he knew his friends would shortly be eager for him to guess which one of them took his guitar. Erik considered what he knew about his friends, hoping he would think of something to help him solve the mystery. He recalled that Trevor was a duck hunter, used to long periods of minimal movement and silence when stalking his prey. As he studied his friend’s faces, it came to him. Without waiting for his mother to leave them, he said, “I know which one of you took my guitar.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Justin Scott; (b) Martin Simmons; (c) Stephen Kennelly; (d) Trevor Sutherland",
      "answer": "(d) Trevor Sutherland",
      "outcome": "Erik winked at the guilty party, who winked back at him. The others did not notice. The guilty one asked, innocently, “So, who took your guitar?”\nHe began speaking, forcefully like the trial lawyer he hoped one day to be. He said, “I know that it was Martin who entered the house around 1:00 a.m. to use the restroom. The light was so dim I could barely see anything, which was the idea, of course, but I was able to tell he was wearing white shoes. At no time was he near the guitar and I certainly didn’t see him touch it.” Pointing at Martin’s feet, he added, “I see they are a bit grass stained this morning, but no doubt they can be easily cleaned. We’ll do it before you go home, if you wish.” Erik continued, “It couldn’t have been Stephen, either. I saw a person at the table pour a glass of water shortly before 2:00. This person had on a white pullover shirt, the type Stephen is wearing now, and he didn’t touch the guitar. Now we are down to two suspects, Trevor and Justin. At around 4:00, I saw a person creeping along the fence to the gate. I glimpsed just for an instant moonlight on a pair of eyeglasses. Justin is the only one in our group who wears eyeglasses.”\nTrevor grinned and said, “Well done, but surely you have some reason you suspect me?”\nErik smiled back and replied, “Yes, I do. Around 3:00 I saw and heard very quiet and stealthy movements. You are a duck hunter and very capable of both. You are also the only one I cannot say for certain did not touch the guitar, because I could not see what you were doing on the patio. I’m guessing you hid it somewhere very close.” Looking around the patio, the huge grill Jenee Taylor had cooked so many delicious meals on stuck out at him like a sore thumb. He said, “Mom, be careful not to clean the grill until I retrieve my guitar. Unless I am mistaken, Trevor hid it behind the grill.”"
