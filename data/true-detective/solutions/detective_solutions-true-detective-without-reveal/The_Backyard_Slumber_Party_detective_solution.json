    "full_text": "Erik’s friends began showing up for the backyard sleepover late in the afternoon. It was spring break and unseasonably warm – perfect weather for spending the night outside. Martin, Justin, Trevor and Stephen had been Erik’s best friends since grade school. They took turns spending the night in each other’s homes and, during the spring and summer months, would often engage in these all night camp outs. Tonight, the first sleepover of the year would be in Erik Taylor’s backyard. While Erik’s mother, Jenee Taylor, grilled hamburgers for the boys on the huge commercial grill beneath the covered patio, Erik began to feel nervous. He was hosting tonight’s party, and he would also be the one to solve a mystery perpetrated by his friends. After dark, one of his friends would pull a practical joke on him. Tomorrow morning, he would have to figure out what the joke was and who had been the prankster. But, for now, the friends enjoyed hamburgers and soft drinks. Erik, a skilled guitar player, serenaded his guests with favorite ballads until darkness overtook the backyard. After visiting under the moonlight until midnight, the boys began to think about breaking up for the night. Each boy had his own pup tent in the Taylor backyard. The tents were arranged as a backfield formation on a football team using the old split T offense. Erik’s tent was in front, perhaps 20 feet in front of the patio. The remaining four tents were set up in a straight line in back of him, the top of the “T,” out of his line of sight and approximately 20 feet back. As the boys prepared to call it a night, Erik reviewed the rules of the game for them. “We’ve been doing this long enough that I shouldn’t have to review the rules, but I will anyway. After we say goodnight, each of you may leave your tent once before sunrise. I may observe what you do from my tent, but I may not leave it.” Erik paused for a moment and then continued, “As you know, our backyard is very dark. There is a faint night light on the patio and there is just enough light from the streetlamp in front of our next door neighbor’s house to be able to see movement back here. It is up to me to stay alert and be able to figure out tomorrow morning what the stunt is and who did it.” The boys grinned, said goodnight to each other and headed towards their respective tents. About an hour later, Erik heard an almost inaudible noise. He looked out the flap of his tent and saw one of his friends softly open the patio door to go inside, probably to use the restroom. He could not tell who it was; his clothing was as dark as the night. However, even in the dim light he noticed his shoes were lighter than the rest of his clothing. A few minutes later, the patio door opened and the dark-clothed friend was careful to return to his tent by walking in the shadows of the stockade fence surrounding the Taylor backyard. Once he had stepped in back of Erik’s tent and line of sight, there was no way to tell who it was. Less than an hour later, Erik heard another faint noise. This time, he saw a figure step out of the shadows and onto the patio. Even though this person appeared to be wearing a white pullover shirt, he could not tell who it was because of the darkness. He did see a silhouette of a person pouring a glass of water from the picnic table and drinking it. Again, the mystery person escaped to the shadows and got behind Erik before he could identify him. Later on, around 3:00 a.m. Erik heard a faint rustling noise coming from the patio. He had dozed off and barely caught it in time. Looking out the tent flap, he saw a shadowy movement on the patio but could not determine who it was or what the figure was doing. Erik thought that, whoever it was, he was good: disciplined with quiet patience. Had he not been expecting a prank, he would never have suspected anyone in the group was up and about, much less moving around on the patio. He was sure though, that it was this unidentified friend who was pulling the prank. This prankster was away, hidden in the shadows, far longer than any of the others. Finally, Erik saw the grayish black outline of his friend creeping along the fence back to his tent. Erik knew there would be one more disturbance before daylight. Sure enough, around 4:00 a.m. Erik heard the now familiar slight rustle of a pup tent flap. As the last night- walker came dimly into view, he saw that he kept within the fence shadows as the others had, but went towards the fence gate, opened it and exited the backyard. A few minutes later, the gate reopened and the unknown chum re-entered the backyard, returning to his tent as the others had. Erik thought he saw the brief glint of a pair of eyeglasses on this person’s forehead. As Erik knew all four of his friends had taken turns outside of their respective tents, he now relaxed and decided to get a couple of hours sleep before breakfast.   Around 8:00 a.m., Jenee fixed pancakes for the boys on the outside grill. It had not taken Erik long to figure out what the prank was. His guitar was missing from its stand on the patio. Now, all he had to do was figure out who took it. There was not much discussion during breakfast. The boys were tired and hungry. It gave Erik time to think through what he had seen – and not seen – during the long dark night. Biting into a piece of bacon, he noticed that Martin was wearing a new pair of athletic shoes. Grass stains had spoiled their pristine newness and added a green tinge to the bright white leather. He also considered it odd that Stephen wore a sweat suit this morning even though it was already warm. It was not just any sweat suit. It was very expensive nylon with matching pants, a windbreaker and white shirt, all sporting the maker’s logo. His mind was racing now. Erik knew that Trevor and Stephen wore contact lenses and Justin wore glasses. As the boys finished breakfast, Erik seriously considered the situation. Think, Erik, think, he said to himself, as he knew his friends would shortly be eager for him to guess which one of them took his guitar. Erik considered what he knew about his friends, hoping he would think of something to help him solve the mystery. He recalled that Trevor was a duck hunter, used to long periods of minimal movement and silence when stalking his prey. As he studied his friend’s faces, it came to him. Without waiting for his mother to leave them, he said, “I know which one of you took my guitar.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First list the four friends who could possibly have taken the guitar: Martin Davis, Justin Lee, Trevor Cole and Stephen Brown.\n\n2. From the story we know exactly four night-walkers appeared, and Erik is certain each boy left his tent once.  \n   • Walker #1 (≈1 a.m.) – dark clothes, noticeably lighter/whiter shoes, went into the house and came straight back.  \n   • Walker #2 (≈2 a.m.) – wore a white pullover, stepped onto the patio only long enough to pour a glass of water.  \n   • Walker #3 (≈3 a.m.) – remained on the patio for a long time, moved very quietly, then crept back along the fence. Erik is sure this is the one who carried out the prank.  \n   • Walker #4 (≈4 a.m.) – hugged the fence shadows to the gate, left the yard for a few minutes, came back; Erik saw the brief flash of eyeglasses on the person’s forehead.\n\n3. Breakfast clues used to identify the walkers:  \n   • Martin is wearing brand-new bright-white athletic shoes now grass-stained. Those shoes would have shown up far lighter than dark clothes → Walker #1 = Martin.  \n   • Stephen is the only one in an expensive nylon warm-up suit with a white shirt (logo) → Walker #2 = Stephen.  \n   • Justin is the only one in the group who wears glasses (the other two contact-lens wearers would not have pushed glasses up on their forehead) → Walker #4 = Justin.  \n   • By simple elimination Walker #3, the long-staying, disciplined prowler, must be Trevor.\n\n4. Why Erik immediately thought of Trevor when he “studied his friends’ faces”: Trevor is an avid duck-hunter who must stay absolutely still and silent in a blind for long stretches. That perfectly matches the behaviour of Walker #3 – the only one who had the patience and stealth to remain on the patio long enough to remove the guitar without being detected.\n\n5. Opportunity: Walker #3 was the only boy who spent enough time on the patio to pull a full-sized guitar off its stand and get it out of sight. Walker #4 went out the gate but Erik never saw him on the patio first, so he could not have taken the guitar without passing Erik’s line of sight. Walkers #1 and #2 were on the patio too briefly (and Erik was watching) to remove the guitar.\n\n6. Motive: everyone’s motive was simply to win the traditional prank game. There is nothing personal; the winner is the one whose trick is guessed last.\n\n7. Conclusion: Trevor, the 3 a.m. walker, is the culprit who spirited away the guitar.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMartin Davis, Justin Lee, Trevor Cole, Stephen Brown\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nTrevor Cole\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n00:00 — The boys say good-night and crawl into their tents.  \n01:00 — Martin (white shoes) slips into the house to use the bathroom; returns straight to his tent.  \n02:00 — Stephen (white pullover) comes to the patio, pours himself a drink of water, goes back.  \n03:00 — Trevor, using the long, patient stealth he has learned from duck-hunting, creeps onto the patio. He stays several minutes, lifts Erik’s guitar from its stand, slips along the fence and hides the instrument (most likely in his own tent).  \n04:00 — Justin pushes his glasses up on his forehead, leaves the yard through the gate for a short while (perhaps to mail a letter, get more soft-drink cans from the car, or just to stretch his legs), then comes back and returns to his tent.  \n08:00 — At breakfast Erik analyzes what he saw versus what is now visible (Martin’s white shoes, Stephen’s white shirt, Justin’s glasses, Trevor’s famously quiet hunting skills) and names Trevor as the prankster.  \n(Some time later he retrieves his guitar from Trevor’s tent.)\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMartin — Easily identified as Walker #1 by his distinctive bright-white shoes. He entered the house briefly and was under Erik’s eyes almost the whole time; no chance to remove the guitar unnoticed.  \nStephen — Walker #2 in the white pullover; he was on the patio only long enough to pour a glass of water, after which the guitar was still on its stand.  \nJustin — Walker #4; the glint of eyeglasses marks him. Erik never saw him approach the patio before going out the gate, so he did not have an opportunity to grab the guitar without being seen.  \nTherefore none of these three had the combination of time, stealth and opportunity that Walker #3 (Trevor) had.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Erik winked at the guilty party, who winked back at him. The others did not notice. The guilty one asked, innocently, “So, who took your guitar?”\nHe began speaking, forcefully like the trial lawyer he hoped one day to be. He said, “I know that it was Martin who entered the house around 1:00 a.m. to use the restroom. The light was so dim I could barely see anything, which was the idea, of course, but I was able to tell he was wearing white shoes. At no time was he near the guitar and I certainly didn’t see him touch it.” Pointing at Martin’s feet, he added, “I see they are a bit grass stained this morning, but no doubt they can be easily cleaned. We’ll do it before you go home, if you wish.” Erik continued, “It couldn’t have been Stephen, either. I saw a person at the table pour a glass of water shortly before 2:00. This person had on a white pullover shirt, the type Stephen is wearing now, and he didn’t touch the guitar. Now we are down to two suspects, Trevor and Justin. At around 4:00, I saw a person creeping along the fence to the gate. I glimpsed just for an instant moonlight on a pair of eyeglasses. Justin is the only one in our group who wears eyeglasses.”\nTrevor grinned and said, “Well done, but surely you have some reason you suspect me?”\nErik smiled back and replied, “Yes, I do. Around 3:00 I saw and heard very quiet and stealthy movements. You are a duck hunter and very capable of both. You are also the only one I cannot say for certain did not touch the guitar, because I could not see what you were doing on the patio. I’m guessing you hid it somewhere very close.” Looking around the patio, the huge grill Jenee Taylor had cooked so many delicious meals on stuck out at him like a sore thumb. He said, “Mom, be careful not to clean the grill until I retrieve my guitar. Unless I am mistaken, Trevor hid it behind the grill.”",

Sure enough, around 4:00 a.m. Erik heard the now familiar slight rustle of a pup tent flap. As the last night- walker came dimly into view, he saw that he kept within the fence shadows as the others had, but went towards the fence gate, opened it and exited the backyard. A few minutes later, the gate reopened and the unknown chum re-entered the backyard, returning to his tent as the others had. Erik thought he saw the brief glint of a pair of eyeglasses on this person’s forehead. As Erik knew all four of his friends had taken turns outside of their respective tents, he now relaxed and decided to get a couple of hours sleep before breakfast.   Around 8:00 a.m., Jenee fixed pancakes for the boys on the outside grill. It had not taken Erik long to figure out what the prank was. His guitar was missing from its stand on the patio. Now, all he had to do was figure out who took it. There was not much discussion during breakfast. The boys were tired and hungry. It gave Erik time to think through what he had seen – and not seen – during the long dark night. Biting into a piece of bacon, he noticed that Martin was wearing a new pair of athletic shoes. Grass stains had spoiled their pristine newness and added a green tinge to the bright white leather. He also considered it odd that Stephen wore a sweat suit this morning even though it was already warm. It was not just any sweat suit. It was very expensive nylon with matching pants, a windbreaker and white shirt, all sporting the maker’s logo. His mind was racing now. Erik knew that Trevor and Stephen wore contact lenses and Justin wore glasses. As the boys finished breakfast, Erik seriously considered the situation. Think, Erik, think, he said to himself, as he knew his friends would shortly be eager for him to guess which one of them took his guitar. Erik considered what he knew about his friends, hoping he would think of something to help him solve the mystery. He recalled that Trevor was a duck hunter, used to long periods of minimal movement and silence when stalking his prey. As he studied his friend’s faces, it came to him. Without waiting for his mother to leave them, he said, “I know which one of you took my guitar.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Justin Scott; (b) Martin Simmons; (c) Stephen Kennelly; (d) Trevor Sutherland",
      "answer": "(d) Trevor Sutherland",
      "outcome": "Erik winked at the guilty party, who winked back at him. The others did not notice. The guilty one asked, innocently, “So, who took your guitar?”\nHe began speaking, forcefully like the trial lawyer he hoped one day to be. He said, “I know that it was Martin who entered the house around 1:00 a.m. to use the restroom. The light was so dim I could barely see anything, which was the idea, of course, but I was able to tell he was wearing white shoes. At no time was he near the guitar and I certainly didn’t see him touch it.” Pointing at Martin’s feet, he added, “I see they are a bit grass stained this morning, but no doubt they can be easily cleaned. We’ll do it before you go home, if you wish.” Erik continued, “It couldn’t have been Stephen, either. I saw a person at the table pour a glass of water shortly before 2:00. This person had on a white pullover shirt, the type Stephen is wearing now, and he didn’t touch the guitar. Now we are down to two suspects, Trevor and Justin. At around 4:00, I saw a person creeping along the fence to the gate. I glimpsed just for an instant moonlight on a pair of eyeglasses. Justin is the only one in our group who wears eyeglasses.”\nTrevor grinned and said, “Well done, but surely you have some reason you suspect me?”\nErik smiled back and replied, “Yes, I do. Around 3:00 I saw and heard very quiet and stealthy movements. You are a duck hunter and very capable of both. You are also the only one I cannot say for certain did not touch the guitar, because I could not see what you were doing on the patio. I’m guessing you hid it somewhere very close.” Looking around the patio, the huge grill Jenee Taylor had cooked so many delicious meals on stuck out at him like a sore thumb. He said, “Mom, be careful not to clean the grill until I retrieve my guitar. Unless I am mistaken, Trevor hid it behind the grill.”"
