    "full_text": "“He's the worst clown ever.” “He's got the worst luck.” “But he's a fantastic kisser!” Whispers buzzed backstage minutes before they started filming the TV show. Distracted stagehands walked by, listening to their earpieces. I was listening to the gossip. “Did he go to clown college?” “He got kicked out.” “Maybe he wasn't funny enough.” “Maybe he was too unlucky!” The stagehands continued ignoring us, until I told the gossipers there was fresh cake in the waiting room. “That cake is for our guest,” one young stage manager said firmly, “and you will treat him with respect.” “It's the way of the world,” joked a comedy writer in a green suit. “No matter where you go, you've got to respect Bumbo.” There was a poster of Bumbo in the hall outside the studio. In it, he wore an enormous frown painted on his face, surrounded by brown greasepaint like an unshaven beard. His ugly face repulsed me (and fascinated me). But even the poster seemed sad, with his black clown's eyes staring helplessly below a torn hat. “Once he got in a cab, and the cab crashed,” the comedy writer continued. “So then he missed his flight to Miami. And then the airplane crashed!” “That's an urban legend,” said a blonde actress. She'd heard the same stories, but over the years she'd met actors who'd actually known Bumbo. “He's bad at math and he's a cheapskate, but he never crashed in a taxi.” She wasn't Bumbo's usual assistant, but they'd hired her to help suggest a circus. She was wearing a top hat, like a ringmaster, and a sparkly black costume. She seemed just as down on the clown as everyone else, even if she had heard that he was a terrific kisser. I was nervous about meeting real show people. It was just yesterday I'd received that frantic phone call about appearing on TV. The bank where I worked raised $10,000 to help poor children -- and they planned to donate it to Bumbo's favorite charity. As a special treat, Bumbo would receive the money on a local variety show that was broadcast to the entire state every Saturday night. I'd represent the bank, standing formally in a suit and tie, while Bumbo would slip, do a somersault, and pretend to drop the suitcase filled with money. They'd prepared green strips of paper that Bumbo would chase after comically, slipping and somersaulting all across the stage. At the end of the skit, I'd hold up a second suitcase -- the one filled with real money -- and Bumbo would sadly shrug his shoulders at the audience. At least, that's what we'd thought was going to happen ... “That's more money than I earned all year,” joked the blonde actress. Her name was Dusty, and she seemed both glamorous and gloomy, wearing heavy makeup hiding the signs of age on her face. She'd been dressed in a leotard for two hours, and her legs looked chilly. “I used to want to be rich and famous. Now I'd settle for just rich.” “Heck, I'd settle for a piece of Bumbo's cake,” said the comedy writer. “I hear it's pretty good.” The comedy writer was always laughing. He was confident and sharp, even while donning a green, pin stripe suit. “Heck, I'd settle for $10,000,” he added, though no one was laughing at his jokes. A few minutes ago when he'd showed up in his green suit, Dusty whispered a catty secret about the writer's wardrobe. In his bedroom closet hung six suits, each one a different shade of green. He thought they'd help people remember his name, which I found out later was -- coincidentally -- Mr. Green. “Stop jabbering,” the stage manager snapped. “The show starts in eight minutes.” Enormous lights pointed towards the empty stage next to us, as even more stagehands began clustering in the wings and behind cameras. He stared at me like he was studying an insect, and then asked “Are you the pie thrower?” No, I explained nervously, I'm from the bank. I hand Bumbo the suitcase of money. “And then you smash a pie into his face,” said the stage manager. “Didn't you read your script?” “Script?” I asked. I'd memorized a statement from the bank, but they hadn't said anything about a pie. “Ouch! Bumbo's not going to like that,” teased Mr. Green. The stage manager seemed irritated. Fighting back anger, he instructed: “Watch for my signal. When I smash my right hand into my left hand … smash the pie into Bumbo's face. Got it?” I nodded nervously. “Don't be scared,” Dusty said. “Bumbo's just like you and me. Except famous.” “And rich,” added Mr. Green. “Why don't you go and talk to him?” “Are you crazy?” Mr. Green answered. “Bumbo's afraid of people! He hides in his dressing room until show time!” Dusty assured me this was just another urban legend, as she pointed me toward the famous clown's dressing room. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Peeking around the corner, I saw that the hallway was empty. All the stagehands had gone to the stage, and the rest of the building looked deserted. But I wasn't sure I was allowed to be there -- even if Dusty said it was OK. Would the clown be frightened by a stranger visiting? Would I be frightened by the visiting clown? Soon my shoes were echoing down the white tile floor. For a moment I just stood outside his door, not sure if I should knock. I checked for the fussy stage manager, but there was no one around, so I took a deep breath, and rapped on the door. It suddenly swung open. I nearly jumped out of my skin. There was that enormous white frown, and cheeks covered with dark brown makeup. But the face didn't move. It just stared at me silently. Not sad, but bored. “Yes?” Bumbo asked. Classical music came from the room behind him. There was a thick Russian novel on a table next to a bottle of vodka. There were makeup dishes in front of the mirror, but the room was completely empty. Bumbo had arrived at the studio already in costume, and though I couldn't be sure, he'd apparently waited alone in his dressing room. “I'm supposed to smash a pie into your face,” I said. “I know,” said Bumbo. “I read the script.” He saw that I was staring at the thick book on his table, and smiled to himself. “Clowns pretend to be stupid,” he said. “But that’s us acting. We're actually very clever.” “Is it difficult to pretend you're stupid?” Bumbo glared back, but didn't speak for a moment. Then he said, “Clowns exist in our mind already.” And now he was really starting to freak me out ... *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* When I stepped out of Bumbo's room, a police officer grabbed me. “Come with me,” he commanded. “But I'm supposed to throw a pie!” “Not any more, you're not,” he said, and led me to two more police officers. Their hair was short, and their uniforms were black. They looked like they never smiled. “Take him upstairs,” the police officer commanded. “No, seriously! I'm supposed to throw a pie!” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* In the back of the TV studio was a second floor conference room where the windows didn't open. It looked out over the parking lot, where I could see two police cars. In the back of the room was the fussy stage manager, insisting that the show had to go on. “I checked with your director,” one of the officers relayed, “and he can delay the taping for another half hour. “And besides,” he said, leaning his face towards the young man. “There's nothing to film. You don't have $10,000 to give to Bumbo. Because somebody stole it!” The stage manager had hidden the suitcase with the money backstage, along with the other suitcase filled with the little green strips of paper. He was going to hand the suitcase with the fake money to Bumbo, and then at the end of the skit, hand the second suitcase to Dusty, who would carry it out to me. But minutes before show time, he'd discovered that there was only one suitcase left. He was sure that he'd secretly tucked both of them into the backstage props closet, and no one knew they were there -- except the stage manager and Dusty. But I was a suspect too, because everyone assumed I'd been carefully watching the bank's money. But I hadn't! And now I'd created a lot of trouble. “Mr. Green knew the money was there, too,” said the stage manager. “He's worked here for years, so he'd know the suitcase had to be in the prop closet before filming. And he'd know it was full of money, since he wrote the skit himself.” “Maybe he needed it to buy more green suits” muttered Dusty. “Anyone else know where the cash was hidden?” asked the police officer. “Bumbo,” said the stage manager. “He always likes to know where his props are.” “And you,” added Bumbo, darkly from the door. We looked up to see him being led in. I expected them to say “trick or treat,” but instead of candy, one of us was going to jail. They frisked Bumbo and the rest of us, but nobody had $10,000 in their pockets. And then the police reviewed the few facts of the case. For the last hour, there'd been a cameraman standing by the prop closet who swore that no one had gone near it. And before that, his camera had been pointed towards the floor, which meant someone in the control booth could see the ground in front of the closet for the previous hour. Exactly one person had entered the closet -- zipping in and out in less than two seconds -- but unfortunately, they couldn't tell who. They'd caught a brief glimpse of a pant leg, but that was useless without the color of the pants, which they couldn't remember. “Heck, it could've been the clown, for all we know,” the policeman complained. “We have to film this show today!” the stage manager complained. But I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  MOTIVE  \n   •  Mr Green and Dusty both joke that they would love to get their hands on the $10 000, but only one person is shown actually needing the show to go on “no matter what” – the young stage–manager.  \n   •  The manager is the only one who had already had the cash literally in his hands, knew exactly where every penny was and could take it without arousing suspicion.  \n   •  If the money vanished, production would be halted – unless the stage-manager could blame someone else and keep shooting.  Calling the police himself and acting indignant is a handy way to deflect suspicion.\n\n2.  OPPORTUNITY  \n   •  According to the video feed, in the whole hour before the cameraman began guarding the door only one person slipped in or out of the prop-closet, taking less than two seconds.  \n   •  Whoever it was had to know in advance which of the two identical cases held the cash; otherwise there would have been time spent opening, checking, closing – impossible in two seconds.  Only the man who actually put the cases in the closet (the stage-manager) could do that.  \n   •  After the theft the same man could simply order a cameraman to stand beside the door “for safety”, guaranteeing that nobody else would be able to approach and that when the loss was discovered every other suspect would already have an alibi.\n\n3.  PHYSICAL EVIDENCE / ALIBIS  \n   •  Bumbo: has been sitting in make-up since early afternoon; the narrator actually sees him there only minutes before the police arrive.  Had he darted down the hall in clown trousers, the control-room people would have remembered the bright, baggy costume rather than “some trouser-leg”.  \n   •  Dusty: is wearing a ring-master’s leotard and tights – no trouser-legs to be seen.  \n   •  Mr Green: is famous for his loud green pin-striped suit; a green flash on the monitor would have been memorable, yet the observers could not even remember the colour.  \n   •  The narrator (bank representative) never learned where the prop closet was, and the only time he is alone is while visiting Bumbo – well after the guard has taken up post at the closet.  \n   •  The only ordinary, forgettable pair of dark trousers belongs to the young stage-manager – a detail that matches the “unmemorable” pant-leg on the monitor.\n\n4.  LOGICAL DEDUCTION  \n   •  The thief needed (a) certain knowledge of which identical suitcase held real money and (b) the chance to get in and out almost instantaneously.  \n   •  The stage-manager alone satisfies both conditions and, being the person who discovered and announced the loss, also had the strongest reason to plant a false trail, e.g., by summoning the police at once.  \n   •  All other suspects either lacked the information, the opportunity, or would have appeared conspicuously on the monitor.\n\nTherefore the stage-manager is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nYoung Stage-Manager, Dusty (the blonde actress), Mr Green (the comedy-writer), Bumbo the Clown, Bank Representative (narrator)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nYoung Stage-Manager  – real name not given\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Earlier in the day the stage-manager placed the real-money suitcase and the prop suitcase side-by-side in the prop closet, knowing exactly which was which.  \n•  A short while later – during the hour when only the overhead camera was pointed at the floor – he returned, opened the door, grabbed the money case (already the one nearest the door), and was out again in under two seconds; the monitor in the control booth caught only a fleeting glimpse of a plain dark trouser-leg.  \n•  He immediately stationed a cameraman beside the closet “to keep people from bumping the camera,” guaranteeing nobody else could approach – and giving himself a perfect alibi when the loss was “discovered.”  \n•  He then raised the alarm, insisted the police be called, and tried to steer suspicion toward Bumbo, Mr Green, Dusty, or even the bewildered banker.  The cash is now hidden elsewhere (very likely in his car in the parking lot the conference-room windows overlook).\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Bumbo: would have been noticed in loud clown pants; moreover he never left his dressing-room until the police brought him upstairs.  \n•  Dusty: wore a leotard/tights, not trousers, so the “pant-leg” on the monitor cannot be hers.  Also she could not have entered the closet unnoticed while standing on stage rehearsing with the others.  \n•  Mr Green: his trademark green suit would have stood out on the monitor feed; the observers would certainly have remembered a bright green blur instead of “can’t recall the colour.”  \n•  Bank Representative: did not even know where the closet was, spent the crucial minute speaking with Bumbo, and was marched off by police shortly afterwards; impossible timing.  \n•  Police officers: arrived only after the theft was reported.\n\nThus only the stage-manager had the knowledge, the means, the forgettable clothing, and the split-second opportunity required to steal the $10 000.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

At least, that's what we'd thought was going to happen ... “That's more money than I earned all year,” joked the blonde actress.

Would the clown be frightened by a stranger visiting? Would I be frightened by the visiting clown? Soon my shoes were echoing down the white tile floor. For a moment I just stood outside his door, not sure if I should knock. I checked for the fussy stage manager, but there was no one around, so I took a deep breath, and rapped on the door. It suddenly swung open. I nearly jumped out of my skin. There was that enormous white frown, and cheeks covered with dark brown makeup. But the face didn't move. It just stared at me silently. Not sad, but bored. “Yes?” Bumbo asked. Classical music came from the room behind him. There was a thick Russian novel on a table next to a bottle of vodka. There were makeup dishes in front of the mirror, but the room was completely empty. Bumbo had arrived at the studio already in costume, and though I couldn't be sure, he'd apparently waited alone in his dressing room. “I'm supposed to smash a pie into your face,” I said. “I know,” said Bumbo. “I read the script.” He saw that I was staring at the thick book on his table, and smiled to himself. “Clowns pretend to be stupid,” he said. “But that’s us acting. We're actually very clever.” “Is it difficult to pretend you're stupid?” Bumbo glared back, but didn't speak for a moment. Then he said, “Clowns exist in our mind already.” And now he was really starting to freak me out ... *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* When I stepped out of Bumbo's room, a police officer grabbed me. “Come with me,” he commanded. “But I'm supposed to throw a pie!” “Not any more, you're not,” he said, and led me to two more police officers. Their hair was short, and their uniforms were black. They looked like they never smiled. “Take him upstairs,” the police officer commanded. “No, seriously! I'm supposed to throw a pie!” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* In the back of the TV studio was a second floor conference room where the windows didn't open. It looked out over the parking lot, where I could see two police cars. In the back of the room was the fussy stage manager, insisting that the show had to go on. “I checked with your director,” one of the officers relayed, “and he can delay the taping for another half hour. “And besides,” he said, leaning his face towards the young man. “There's nothing to film. You don't have $10,000 to give to Bumbo. Because somebody stole it!” The stage manager had hidden the suitcase with the money backstage, along with the other suitcase filled with the little green strips of paper. He was going to hand the suitcase with the fake money to Bumbo, and then at the end of the skit, hand the second suitcase to Dusty, who would carry it out to me. But minutes before show time, he'd discovered that there was only one suitcase left. He was sure that he'd secretly tucked both of them into the backstage props closet, and no one knew they were there -- except the stage manager and Dusty. But I was a suspect too, because everyone assumed I'd been carefully watching the bank's money. But I hadn't! And now I'd created a lot of trouble. “Mr. Green knew the money was there, too,” said the stage manager. “He's worked here for years, so he'd know the suitcase had to be in the prop closet before filming. And he'd know it was full of money, since he wrote the skit himself.” “Maybe he needed it to buy more green suits” muttered Dusty. “Anyone else know where the cash was hidden?” asked the police officer. “Bumbo,” said the stage manager. “He always likes to know where his props are.” “And you,” added Bumbo, darkly from the door. We looked up to see him being led in. I expected them to say “trick or treat,” but instead of candy, one of us was going to jail. They frisked Bumbo and the rest of us, but nobody had $10,000 in their pockets. And then the police reviewed the few facts of the case. For the last hour, there'd been a cameraman standing by the prop closet who swore that no one had gone near it. And before that, his camera had been pointed towards the floor, which meant someone in the control booth could see the ground in front of the closet for the previous hour. Exactly one person had entered the closet -- zipping in and out in less than two seconds -- but unfortunately, they couldn't tell who. They'd caught a brief glimpse of a pant leg, but that was useless without the color of the pants, which they couldn't remember. “Heck, it could've been the clown, for all we know,” the policeman complained. “We have to film this show today!” the stage manager complained. But I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

      "mystery_text": "“He's the worst clown ever.” “He's got the worst luck.” “But he's a fantastic kisser!” Whispers buzzed backstage minutes before they started filming the TV show. Distracted stagehands walked by, listening to their earpieces. I was listening to the gossip. “Did he go to clown college?” “He got kicked out.” “Maybe he wasn't funny enough.” “Maybe he was too unlucky!” The stagehands continued ignoring us, until I told the gossipers there was fresh cake in the waiting room. “That cake is for our guest,” one young stage manager said firmly, “and you will treat him with respect.” “It's the way of the world,” joked a comedy writer in a green suit. “No matter where you go, you've got to respect Bumbo.” There was a poster of Bumbo in the hall outside the studio. In it, he wore an enormous frown painted on his face, surrounded by brown greasepaint like an unshaven beard. His ugly face repulsed me (and fascinated me). But even the poster seemed sad, with his black clown's eyes staring helplessly below a torn hat. “Once he got in a cab, and the cab crashed,” the comedy writer continued. “So then he missed his flight to Miami. And then the airplane crashed!” “That's an urban legend,” said a blonde actress. She'd heard the same stories, but over the years she'd met actors who'd actually known Bumbo. “He's bad at math and he's a cheapskate, but he never crashed in a taxi.” She wasn't Bumbo's usual assistant, but they'd hired her to help suggest a circus. She was wearing a top hat, like a ringmaster, and a sparkly black costume. She seemed just as down on the clown as everyone else, even if she had heard that he was a terrific kisser. I was nervous about meeting real show people. It was just yesterday I'd received that frantic phone call about appearing on TV. The bank where I worked raised $10,000 to help poor children -- and they planned to donate it to Bumbo's favorite charity. As a special treat, Bumbo would receive the money on a local variety show that was broadcast to the entire state every Saturday night. I'd represent the bank, standing formally in a suit and tie, while Bumbo would slip, do a somersault, and pretend to drop the suitcase filled with money. They'd prepared green strips of paper that Bumbo would chase after comically, slipping and somersaulting all across the stage. At the end of the skit, I'd hold up a second suitcase -- the one filled with real money -- and Bumbo would sadly shrug his shoulders at the audience. At least, that's what we'd thought was going to happen ... “That's more money than I earned all year,” joked the blonde actress. Her name was Dusty, and she seemed both glamorous and gloomy, wearing heavy makeup hiding the signs of age on her face. She'd been dressed in a leotard for two hours, and her legs looked chilly. “I used to want to be rich and famous. Now I'd settle for just rich.” “Heck, I'd settle for a piece of Bumbo's cake,” said the comedy writer. “I hear it's pretty good.” The comedy writer was always laughing. He was confident and sharp, even while donning a green, pin stripe suit. “Heck, I'd settle for $10,000,” he added, though no one was laughing at his jokes. A few minutes ago when he'd showed up in his green suit, Dusty whispered a catty secret about the writer's wardrobe. In his bedroom closet hung six suits, each one a different shade of green. He thought they'd help people remember his name, which I found out later was -- coincidentally -- Mr. Green. “Stop jabbering,” the stage manager snapped. “The show starts in eight minutes.” Enormous lights pointed towards the empty stage next to us, as even more stagehands began clustering in the wings and behind cameras. He stared at me like he was studying an insect, and then asked “Are you the pie thrower?” No, I explained nervously, I'm from the bank. I hand Bumbo the suitcase of money. “And then you smash a pie into his face,” said the stage manager. “Didn't you read your script?” “Script?” I asked. I'd memorized a statement from the bank, but they hadn't said anything about a pie. “Ouch! Bumbo's not going to like that,” teased Mr. Green. The stage manager seemed irritated. Fighting back anger, he instructed: “Watch for my signal. When I smash my right hand into my left hand … smash the pie into Bumbo's face. Got it?” I nodded nervously. “Don't be scared,” Dusty said. “Bumbo's just like you and me. Except famous.” “And rich,” added Mr. Green. “Why don't you go and talk to him?” “Are you crazy?” Mr. Green answered. “Bumbo's afraid of people! He hides in his dressing room until show time!” Dusty assured me this was just another urban legend, as she pointed me toward the famous clown's dressing room. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Peeking around the corner, I saw that the hallway was empty.
