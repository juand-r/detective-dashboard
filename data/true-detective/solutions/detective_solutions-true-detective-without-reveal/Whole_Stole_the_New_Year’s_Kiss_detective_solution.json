    "full_text": "For years, the five families had gotten together several times a year. They had first become friends long ago when they all lived at the Keswick Apartment complex together as young couples. Over the years, they had all advanced in their careers and long since moved out of the apartment complex. Yet, they had all remained friends. In addition to the occasional party in which they all got together, they always rented a great big house on the Outer Banks of North Carolina for four days over New Year’s. One of the things that made it easier for all of them to remain friends was that each couple had children that were all about the same age. Each couple had a teenager between 14 and 16. They all also had children in the 8 to 10 year old range, a total of eight children in this age range among the five families. All of the children had been friends since the day they were born, all of the older kids having been born while their parents lived at the apartment complex. While the younger children were evenly split into four boys and four girls, the same was not the case with the older children. For the older children, there were four boys and just a single girl: Aly. For most of the time growing up, Aly was a tomboy who fit in perfectly with the other boys, but this New Year’s was different. While she was still an athlete who enjoyed sports, Aly was turning into an attractive young woman. That fact was most certainly not lost on the four boys. Aly’s dad Tom certainly made note of the attention that his daughter was now receiving from the boys. He was going to do his best to keep an eye on his oldest daughter. As was tradition when the families went to the Outer Banks, the families split into two groups. The adults took over the giant great room on the top floor next to the kitchen. There they would play cards, talk and watch TV while everyone took turns in the kitchen. Meanwhile, the children went to the playroom on the bottom floor. This room had a pool table, a ping-pong table, plenty of couches and a big screen TV. It was not problem keeping the kids occupied. Long ago, the kids had set up a rule of winner stays on the table for the ping-pong and pool tables. All of the little kids hoped that someday they would be able to unseat the long time champs. Danny owned the ping-pong table. As always, he got on the table and won every game he played. His plan was to see if he could play from right after dinner until sunrise without losing a game. Meanwhile, Reese owned the pool table. He fancied himself as a pool shark and he certainly seemed to play like one. Having heard Danny’s challenge, his goal was to do exactly the same thing on the pool table. All of the other children took turns challenging first one and then the other. Everyone knew that if anyone ever beat Danny or Reese, there would most certainly be a loud celebration. For the most part, Tom was prepared to enjoy New Year’s Eve. When everyone first arrived, he had scoured the house to ensure that there was no lingering mistletoe that might prompt one of the young boys to steal a kiss from Aly. However, he was really worried that at the stroke of midnight, one of them would be tempted to steak a kiss. He knew however that as long as Aly was downstairs with everyone, she would not kiss anyone in front of all the other children. Thus, he put his mind to rest and enjoyed his New Year’s celebration. As she always did just before midnight, Diane took a big plate of her world famous chocolate chip cookies down to the kids. The rule was that as soon as it hit midnight, they were free to pounce on them, but not a moment before. They never lasted for more than a minute or two before the kids had finished them off. As the clock struck midnight, Tom went out onto the top deck with all of the other parents to watch the fireworks that always went off a few minutes after midnight. That was when he saw his daughter climb over the sand dune and head back into the house. Although Tom did not see any of the boys with Aly, he was pretty certain that Aly had been on the other side of the sand dune at midnight with one of the boys. While he was confident that Aly would tell him the truth about kissing one of the boys if she did it, he also knew that she would never tell him who it was. Thus, he was going to have to figure it out for himself if he was going to ever know. Telling his wife Diane that he would be back in a few minutes, Tom went downstairs to talk with Aly and the other kids. The first thing that he did when he got downstairs was to ask the kids if anything special had happened tonight. Other than it being just after midnight on New Year’s Eve, there was nothing unusual that happened. He then asked Aly if he could talk to her in private. She giggled and said yes. When he asked her what she was doing out behind the sand dune at midnight, she told him that she had been with one of the boys. She also told him that indeed, she had kissed him. The pounding in his head told Tom that it was going to be a very long year, even if Aly was a really great kid. His next question was who was the boy. As expected, Aly refused to give him the name. It looked like he was going to have to do some investigative work. Jeremy, his face covered in chocolate, came up to Tom and told him that as always, his wife had made the greatest cookies. Tom was too busy to pay attention as he was trying to figure out who it was that had kissed his daughter. Unfortunately, he had no clue whatsoever, so reluctantly Tom headed upstairs to face Diane. After telling everything to Diane, he asked her if she would please try to get Aly to tell her who had kissed her. Diane said that she did not need to ask, as she already knew.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWho could Aly have been with?\n•\tOnly one of the four teenage boys.  The younger 8-to-10-year-olds are too young and all of the adults were on the top deck with Tom when the fireworks began.\n\n2.\tWhich of the four boys had the OPPORTUNITY to slip away at 11:59 p.m.?  \n•\tDanny – champion on the ping-pong table.  If he left, someone else would immediately step up, the game would stop and the “winner-stays-on” streak he was boasting about would be broken.  When Tom came downstairs a few minutes after midnight the ping-pong game was still in full swing and nobody was cheering that Danny had finally been beaten, so Danny never left.  \n•\tReese – champion on the pool table under the same winner-stays-on rule.  For exactly the same reason Reese could not have left; otherwise the other children would have been talking excitedly about finally getting a chance to own the table.  \n•\tJeremy – his face was smeared with chocolate from the cookies.  The cookies could not be eaten until the very second the new year began, and they are always gone “within a minute or two.”  If Jeremy had been outside behind the dune, he would have missed the cookies and would not be covered with chocolate.  Therefore Jeremy was still in the play-room at midnight.  \n•\tThe only remaining teenage boy (his name is never given in the story).  He was not tied to either game table, and Diane, who carried the cookies down a minute before midnight, noticed that he (and Aly) were the two teenagers missing at that moment.\n\n3.\tWhat PHYSICAL / DIRECT evidence is there?  \n•\tThe chocolate on Jeremy’s face keeps him inside.  \n•\tThe uninterrupted reigns of Danny and Reese keep them inside.  \n•\tDiane saw which child was not in the room when she delivered the cookies; therefore she already “knew” who was with Aly.\n\n4.\tLogical deduction  \nAll but one of the teenage boys are proven to have been in the play-room at the critical moment.  The only boy without an alibi is the fourth, unnamed teenage boy.  He is necessarily the one who slipped outside with Aly and received the New-Year’s-Eve kiss.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDanny, Reese, Jeremy, “the other” teenage boy (name not stated)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nThe fourth teenage boy – the only older boy who was not Danny, Reese or Jeremy (his exact first and last name are not supplied in the story)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n23:57 – Diane takes her chocolate-chip cookies downstairs.  \n23:58 – She notices that all of the younger children, Danny (playing ping-pong), Reese (playing pool) and Jeremy (waiting hungrily) are present.  Aly and one other teenage boy are missing.  \n23:59 – Aly and the unnamed boy slip out the back door, cross the small board-walk and crouch behind the sand dune so they will be alone when the new year begins.  \n00:00 – The ball drops; they share a quick New-Year’s kiss.  They separate at once so Aly can get back without being missed.  \n00:01 – Aly climbs back over the dune and is seen by her father from the top-floor deck.  The boy stays hidden until Aly is inside, then re-enters through a downstairs door.  \n00:02 – By the time Tom arrives downstairs all of the children except Aly are pretending nothing happened.  \n00:03 – Jeremy, who has just gorged himself on cookies, thanks Tom for his wife’s baking; his chocolate-smeared face unwittingly supplies Tom with an alibi for him.  \n00:10 – Tom returns upstairs and tells Diane what he has discovered.  Diane, having already observed which boy was absent when she brought the cookies, tells Tom she already knows the answer: the only teenage boy who wasn’t in the room when the cookies were delivered – the fourth, unnamed boy – is Aly’s midnight kisser.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nDanny – Had to stay at the ping-pong table to keep his undefeated streak alive; the game was still running when Tom arrived, which would have been impossible if Danny had slipped out.\n\nReese – Likewise had to remain at the pool table to protect his “shark” reputation; no one celebrated his defeat, showing he never left.\n\nJeremy – His face covered in chocolate proves he was attacking the cookie plate the very instant eating was permitted.  If he were outside kissing Aly, he would have missed the cookies (they disappear in under two minutes) and would not be smeared with chocolate.\n\nTherefore the only possible boy left – the teenager whose name the author never gives – must be and is the one who kissed Aly behind the sand dune.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
