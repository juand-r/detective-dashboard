    "full_text": "The stagecoach rolled to a dusty stop at the Wichita, Kansas station, and four more passengers climbed aboard to join Frank Clairmont, who’d boarded back at Dodge City. He tipped his bowler hat at each fellow traveler in turn: a cowboy, a sheriff, a lady and a gunslinger. Frank’s shrewd brown eyes looked over all four as they settled down onto the two bench seats that faced one another inside the stagecoach. The cowboy was short and squat, bowlegged, with a sunburnt face and neck and an amiable twinkle in his sky-blue eyes. The sheriff was large and bulky with a bushy grey mustache. He was wearing a white twenty-gallon hat and a pair of ivory-handled pistols. The lady was young and pretty, with bright red hair and flashing green eyes, dressed in a black cloak and blue dress and white gloves. While the gunslinger was a lanky man with long fingers, a wan face, and steel-grey eyes, clad entirely in black, the guns strapped to his narrow hips matching the sheriff’s in size and caliber. The driver cracked the reins and the horses whinnied jerking the stage to a start. The long, rough trip across the plains to St. Joseph, Missouri was underway. Frank Clairmont worked for the stagecoach company as a security officer. There had been a rash of hold-ups along this particular route. There had also been numerous complaints from customers about pickpockets and card sharks working the line. Passengers’ personal items had been stolen. Other passengers had been cheated at card games by unscrupulous operators. Frank glanced from face to face, but failed to recognize anybody from the collection of Wanted Posters of known bandits and confidence men and women kept back at headquarters in St. Jo. He didn’t even recognize the sheriff or the gunslinger. But that wasn’t all that unusual – men in those two professions tended to come and go pretty quickly in the Wild West. “How ‘bout a game of cards to pass the time?” the cowboy asked good-naturedly, half-an-hour into the hot, bumpy journey. Frank’s ears pricked up. The sheriff and the gunslinger’s eyes narrowed. The lady smiled demurely at the roughhewn cowhand and said, “All right.” The gunslinger instantly whipped a deck of cards out of his jacket pocket. “Any objections?” The sheriff grunted. “Fine with me as long as no one objects to me doing most of the dealing?” “Fine with me,” the gunslinger said, “I like to keep my hands free, anyway, just in case I need them for something else.” He fingered the butt of a revolver with his left hand. The lady and the cowboy nodded. Then the lady removed her cloak and spread it over the four sets of knees, as the other players crowded closer, forming a crude sort of table. She smiled sweetly at Frank. “Would you like to partake in our friendly game of cards, sir?” she enquired. Frank shook his head. “No, thanks. I’m saving all my money to buy a homestead down in Abilene.” “Deal,” the gunslinger said, tossing the deck of cards to the sheriff. The game was straight poker. Frank pushed his bowler hat down and pretended to doze off to the sway and jostle of the stagecoach. Actually, though, he was watching the proceedings and the people closely, looking for signs of cheating. He also kept an eye on the window of the stagecoach, for signs of trouble outside, an ear cocked for the thump of the guard’s shotgun up top, which would signal trouble. The card game could well be a ruse for a hold-up. But as they bounced along the rutted trail, through the shimmering grasslands, Frank didn’t detect anything untoward. The cowboy lost steadily, the lady won moderately, and the gunslinger and the sheriff traded the larger pots back and forth. The sheriff played his cards close to the vest, literally, holding them tight to his vest up by his five-pointed tin star, sinking his chin down into his chest to look them over, careful to reveal nothing. While the lady held her cards daintily up in front of her, constantly fanning them out or shuffling them around, or even fanning herself with them. The gunslinger kept his cards facedown in his lap, allowing his hands to remain free, only peeling back the top edges of the cards every so often to see what he had. The cowboy held his cards right up close to his face, like he had trouble seeing them. This also helped to keep the other players from reading his rather expressive eyes. The lady won a small pot, the gunslinger won a large one against the ever more despondent cowboy, and then the sheriff won a large one against all three players. Finally, Frank, getting bored, asked to be dealt into a hand. He scooped up the five cards with his right hand and pushed them apart with his thumb: a three of clubs, six of diamonds, ten of hearts, king of clubs, and the ace of spades. He grimaced at the so-so hand, rubbing his thumb across the face of the ace of spades. And then Frank grinned. “Hmm,” he mused, “there seems to be a small scratch on the face of this card.” With narrowed eyes that appeared ice cold, the gunslinger barked, “What’s that?” “Yes, a small vertical scratch, almost unnoticeable – unless you’re feeling for it.” Frank rubbed the king of clubs, in the middle. “And this card has a horizontal scratch on it, if you feel really close.” “You saying that somebody’s marked the cards, mister?” the sheriff growled, slowly setting the deck down. “I believe he’s saying that someone is cheating, yes,” the lady helpfully provided. The gunslinger and the sheriff’s right hands moved towards their pistols. The cowboy’s red face went almost pale, his strangled gulp sounding loud and clear in the hot, crackling air. “Somebody’s cheating, for sure,” Frank stated calmly. He raised the small Derringer pistol he’d kept hidden under the cloak with his left hand. “And I’m taking them into custody, on behalf of the Overland Express Stagecoach Company.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Goal of Frank Clairmont: locate the “card-shark” who has been plying the Overland Express line.\n2. Only one of the four new passengers could have brought a pre-marked deck aboard, because Frank had no cards and the cowboy merely proposed the game – he did not produce a deck.\n3. The deck is produced by the GUNSLINGER. That gives him sole opportunity to prepare the pack in advance and mark it.\n4. Nature of the marks: faint scratches that can be detected more by the fingertips than by sight (“almost unnoticeable – unless you’re feeling for it”).  \n   • Someone who means to USE those scratches will keep his fingertips in constant contact with the card faces, not merely glance at them.  \n   • The gunslinger keeps every card “face-down in his lap” and “only peeled back the top edges of the cards every so often,” leaving both hands free to rest on the card-faces. Perfect for reading the scratches by touch.  \n   • The sheriff, lady and cowboy all hold their cards up where only their eyes— not the pads of their fingers—touch the faces. The lady even wears gloves, killing all tactile sensitivity.  \n   • Therefore the only player whose ordinary posture matches the cheating method is the gunslinger.\n5. Motive and benefit: the gunslinger wins the largest pots; he deliberately lets the sheriff win a few so the stack of chips shifts back and forth and suspicion is spread. Monetary gain is the motive.\n6. Frank’s discovery: the scratches are on two cards he has JUST been dealt. That means the whole pack is already marked; the only one who had time to do that before the trip started is the man who supplied it.\n7. The gunslinger tries to shift suspicion by volunteering the sheriff to deal (“Fine with me as long as no one objects to me doing most of the dealing”). Classic cheat’s trick: let someone else handle the crooked deck so you look innocent.\n8. No one else had both the means (owning the deck), the opportunity (time to prepare it), and the correct method (tactile reading) to cheat.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nThe Cowboy, the Sheriff, the Lady, the Gunslinger\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nThe Gunslinger – alias “Black-Jack” Bill Dawson (true name unknown)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Before boarding, the gunslinger marked an ordinary poker deck with a private code of tiny horizontal and vertical scratches that can be read by touch.  \n• On the stage he keeps the deck hidden until the cowboy proposes “a friendly game.”  \n• Producing the deck himself, he smoothly lets the sheriff do the dealing so nobody will accuse him of manipulating the cards.  \n• While the others look at their hands, the gunslinger rests his fingertips on the card faces in his lap, instantly knowing every card by the pattern of scratches.  \n• He wins the biggest pots, losing the occasional hand to avoid appearing unbeatable.  \n• When Frank finally sits in, he happens to rub two card faces and notices the scratch code.  \n• Realising only the man who supplied the deck could have arranged this, Frank draws his derringer and arrests the gunslinger for fraud and attempted larceny on the Overland Express line.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• The Cowboy never handled the deck before the game began and was the principal loser. He gained nothing and had no chance to mark the cards.  \n• The Lady wore white gloves that would prevent her from feeling the tiny scratches; she also did not bring the cards. Her modest winnings were simply normal poker luck.  \n• The Sheriff acted as dealer, but the deck was handed to him already prepared; his playing style (cards tight to his vest, eyes only) shows he relied on sight, not touch. He was an unknowing dupe.  \nTherefore none of them had the combination of means, opportunity and method possessed by the gunslinger.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
