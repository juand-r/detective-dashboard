    "full_text": "The stagecoach rolled to a dusty stop at the Wichita, Kansas station, and four more passengers climbed aboard to join Frank Clairmont, who’d boarded back at Dodge City. He tipped his bowler hat at each fellow traveler in turn: a cowboy, a sheriff, a lady and a gunslinger. Frank’s shrewd brown eyes looked over all four as they settled down onto the two bench seats that faced one another inside the stagecoach. The cowboy was short and squat, bowlegged, with a sunburnt face and neck and an amiable twinkle in his sky-blue eyes. The sheriff was large and bulky with a bushy grey mustache. He was wearing a white twenty-gallon hat and a pair of ivory-handled pistols. The lady was young and pretty, with bright red hair and flashing green eyes, dressed in a black cloak and blue dress and white gloves. While the gunslinger was a lanky man with long fingers, a wan face, and steel-grey eyes, clad entirely in black, the guns strapped to his narrow hips matching the sheriff’s in size and caliber. The driver cracked the reins and the horses whinnied jerking the stage to a start. The long, rough trip across the plains to St. Joseph, Missouri was underway. Frank Clairmont worked for the stagecoach company as a security officer. There had been a rash of hold-ups along this particular route. There had also been numerous complaints from customers about pickpockets and card sharks working the line. Passengers’ personal items had been stolen. Other passengers had been cheated at card games by unscrupulous operators. Frank glanced from face to face, but failed to recognize anybody from the collection of Wanted Posters of known bandits and confidence men and women kept back at headquarters in St. Jo. He didn’t even recognize the sheriff or the gunslinger. But that wasn’t all that unusual – men in those two professions tended to come and go pretty quickly in the Wild West. “How ‘bout a game of cards to pass the time?” the cowboy asked good-naturedly, half-an-hour into the hot, bumpy journey. Frank’s ears pricked up. The sheriff and the gunslinger’s eyes narrowed. The lady smiled demurely at the roughhewn cowhand and said, “All right.” The gunslinger instantly whipped a deck of cards out of his jacket pocket. “Any objections?” The sheriff grunted. “Fine with me as long as no one objects to me doing most of the dealing?” “Fine with me,” the gunslinger said, “I like to keep my hands free, anyway, just in case I need them for something else.” He fingered the butt of a revolver with his left hand. The lady and the cowboy nodded. Then the lady removed her cloak and spread it over the four sets of knees, as the other players crowded closer, forming a crude sort of table. She smiled sweetly at Frank. “Would you like to partake in our friendly game of cards, sir?” she enquired. Frank shook his head. “No, thanks. I’m saving all my money to buy a homestead down in Abilene.” “Deal,” the gunslinger said, tossing the deck of cards to the sheriff. The game was straight poker. Frank pushed his bowler hat down and pretended to doze off to the sway and jostle of the stagecoach. Actually, though, he was watching the proceedings and the people closely, looking for signs of cheating. He also kept an eye on the window of the stagecoach, for signs of trouble outside, an ear cocked for the thump of the guard’s shotgun up top, which would signal trouble. The card game could well be a ruse for a hold-up. But as they bounced along the rutted trail, through the shimmering grasslands, Frank didn’t detect anything untoward. The cowboy lost steadily, the lady won moderately, and the gunslinger and the sheriff traded the larger pots back and forth. The sheriff played his cards close to the vest, literally, holding them tight to his vest up by his five-pointed tin star, sinking his chin down into his chest to look them over, careful to reveal nothing. While the lady held her cards daintily up in front of her, constantly fanning them out or shuffling them around, or even fanning herself with them. The gunslinger kept his cards facedown in his lap, allowing his hands to remain free, only peeling back the top edges of the cards every so often to see what he had. The cowboy held his cards right up close to his face, like he had trouble seeing them. This also helped to keep the other players from reading his rather expressive eyes. The lady won a small pot, the gunslinger won a large one against the ever more despondent cowboy, and then the sheriff won a large one against all three players. Finally, Frank, getting bored, asked to be dealt into a hand. He scooped up the five cards with his right hand and pushed them apart with his thumb: a three of clubs, six of diamonds, ten of hearts, king of clubs, and the ace of spades. He grimaced at the so-so hand, rubbing his thumb across the face of the ace of spades. And then Frank grinned. “Hmm,” he mused, “there seems to be a small scratch on the face of this card.” With narrowed eyes that appeared ice cold, the gunslinger barked, “What’s that?” “Yes, a small vertical scratch, almost unnoticeable – unless you’re feeling for it.” Frank rubbed the king of clubs, in the middle. “And this card has a horizontal scratch on it, if you feel really close.” “You saying that somebody’s marked the cards, mister?” the sheriff growled, slowly setting the deck down. “I believe he’s saying that someone is cheating, yes,” the lady helpfully provided. The gunslinger and the sheriff’s right hands moved towards their pistols. The cowboy’s red face went almost pale, his strangled gulp sounding loud and clear in the hot, crackling air. “Somebody’s cheating, for sure,” Frank stated calmly. He raised the small Derringer pistol he’d kept hidden under the cloak with his left hand. “And I’m taking them into custody, on behalf of the Overland Express Stagecoach Company.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   –  The only “crime” Frank specifically mentions is cheating at cards.  \n   –  Winning big pots provides the motive.  During the play the sheriff and the gunslinger are the only ones who steadily win sizeable pots; the lady only wins moderately and the cowboy only loses.  \n   –  The one with the greatest immediate profit from the cheating is the sheriff – he wins the really large pot that cleans out the cowboy.\n\n2.  Opportunity  \n   –  The gunslinger produces the deck, but the sheriff immediately says he will do “most of the dealing” and actually does so.  \n   –  A card-sharp who can recognize marked cards gets the maximum edge when he is the dealer: he can locate, retain or slip good cards to himself.  \n   –  While dealing the sheriff alone is holding every card in his hand long enough to feel for scratches on the face.\n\n3.  Physical evidence  \n   –  The scratches Frank finds are on the faces of the cards, not on the backs.  \n   –  You can only feel those scratches while a card is lying flat in your hand – exactly the position it is in while a dealer is holding the pack and peeling off the top card.  \n   –  A player who merely keeps his cards in his lap (the gunslinger), fans them in the air (the lady) or holds them close to his face (the cowboy) would not keep rubbing the flat face of each card with a thumb.  The sheriff, however, keeps his cards tight “up by his vest,” his thumb naturally lying on the face.\n\n4.  Behavioural clues  \n   –  The sheriff is the only one who immediately reacts menacingly when Frank mentions the scratches; his hand moves to his gun.  The truly innocent would first look surprised, not reach for a weapon.  \n   –  He also growls the question, as if challenging anyone to name him.  \n   –  The gunslinger, who supplied the pack, shows no surprise at letting somebody else deal; that strongly suggests he is not working a solo con.  A card-sharp almost never lets a stranger handle a pre-prepared deck.\n\n5.  Logic  \n   –  Scratching an entire deck in a consistent code takes time; therefore the deck had to have been marked before the trip began.  Whoever introduced the deck must know the code.  \n   –  But introducing the deck alone is not enough; you must be able to read the marks while the game is on.  Only the dealer can examine the face of every card.  \n   –  Therefore the culprit must be the person who both knows the code and insisted on dealing: the sheriff.  There is no clear evidence that anyone else shares that code, so no accomplice can be proved.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFrank Clairmont, the cowboy, the sheriff, the lady, the gunslinger\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nThe sheriff (name not given)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBefore boarding, the sheriff prepared a deck whose high-value cards were scratched with a simple tactile code—a vertical nick for aces, a horizontal one for kings, and so on.  \nWhen the gunslinger pulled out his own (clean) deck, the sheriff immediately volunteered to do all the dealing, switched the marked deck for the gunslinger’s while everyone’s attention was on the lady spreading her cloak, and began to deal.\n\nEach time he held the pack he could feel the next card’s value.  If it was a good card he either dealt it to himself or saved it for a later “second” deal, quietly cheating his way to the large pots.  Because the marks were on the faces, no one else noticed anything odd while merely looking at backs.\n\nFrank Clairmont, who had been feigning sleep, finally took a hand himself, felt the scratch on the ace of spades, checked another card and confirmed a pattern.  Realising the cards were marked, he accused the table.  The sheriff, knowing he was caught, reached for his gun, but Frank was faster with his hidden Derringer and placed the sheriff under arrest for cheating the passengers.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Frank Clairmont – company guard whose only interest is catching cheats; he gains nothing by marking cards and voluntarily exposes the fraud.  \n•  The cowboy – loses consistently, showing he is not benefiting from the marks.  His shock when accused is genuine.  \n•  The lady – wins only small pots, handles her cards in mid-air where she could not plausibly feel minute scratches.  \n•  The gunslinger – supplies the deck but never touches it after handing it over; he keeps his hands away, declaring he “likes to keep them free.”  Without handling the pack he could not exploit scratch marks on the faces, and there is no sign he can read them on the backs.  His winnings are smaller than the sheriff’s and evenly traded back, consistent with honest play.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "‘Marking’ cards, especially the high value cards (jack, queen, king, and ace), is a common way of cheating, as it allows the cheater to identify these cards, know who has them, and adjust his betting accordingly. Marking cards can be done in a number of ways: inking or writing on the cards, or bending, tearing, bumping, or scratching the cards (as in this case). The marking is either done to the deck of cards beforehand, prior to any hands being dealt, or during the game itself.\nThe lady is innocent of cheating because she’s wearing gloves, and, therefore, wouldn’t be able to very well feel the scratches, if she’d made them. The cowboy is also innocent, because he’s lost the most money.\nThe gunslinger supplied the deck of cards, so he could’ve marked them beforehand. But the cards have been scratched on their faces, or fronts, not on their backs, so the only advantage in this situation would be to the dealer, who can feel for the scratches and identify the cards as he deals them out. The gunslinger is, therefore, innocent because he never dealt the cards. He likes to keep his hands free.\nThe dealer for most hands was the sheriff. He’d insisted on that at the start of the game, so he could feel the marked cards as he dealt them. He marked the cards as the game was in-progress by scratching them with the points of his tin badge, as he held his cards ‘close to the vest’.",

Marking cards can be done in a number of ways: inking or writing on the cards, or bending, tearing, bumping, or scratching the cards (as in this case). The marking is either done to the deck of cards beforehand, prior to any hands being dealt, or during the game itself.\nThe lady is innocent of cheating because she’s wearing gloves, and, therefore, wouldn’t be able to very well feel the scratches, if she’d made them. The cowboy is also innocent, because he’s lost the most money.\nThe gunslinger supplied the deck of cards, so he could’ve marked them beforehand. But the cards have been scratched on their faces, or fronts, not on their backs, so the only advantage in this situation would be to the dealer, who can feel for the scratches and identify the cards as he deals them out. The gunslinger is, therefore, innocent because he never dealt the cards. He likes to keep his hands free.\nThe dealer for most hands was the sheriff. He’d insisted on that at the start of the game, so he could feel the marked cards as he dealt them. He marked the cards as the game was in-progress by scratching them with the points of his tin badge, as he held his cards ‘close to the vest’."
