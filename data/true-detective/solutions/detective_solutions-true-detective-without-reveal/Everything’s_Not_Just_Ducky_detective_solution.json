    "full_text": "The County Fair was just getting going for the day when Connor and his best friend, Tim, checked in for duty at the Duck Race tent. “Well, look who’s here,” Bethany drawled, tossing her golden-blonde hair back and wrinkling her button nose at Connor. “Finally scrounged up enough money to fix your bike, did you?” Bethany and Connor had been a couple, before Connor had broken up with her for a variety of reasons. Not the least of which was that while his parents were poor, Bethany’s were rich, meaning he just couldn’t keep up with his classmate’s expensive tastes. “Hi, Bethany,” he mumbled, looking sheepish. “No, Tim’s mom gave us a ride.” He glanced over at the other girl standing off to the side, and said, “Hi, Emma.” Emma barely nodded her head, her skinny arms folded across the front of her black t-shirt, her pale face reflecting disinterest and boredom as befitted her goth status. “OK, good, everyone’s finally here,” Milton Siegfried said, glancing nervously at his watch. He was the adult in charge of operating the ‘Duck Stand’ from nine ‘til noon. And although he had plenty of experience handling money (being a bookkeeper by trade), he had little experience handling teenagers. He pushed his wire-rimmed glasses up his bony nose, nervously surveying the four thirteen-year-olds. Then he said, “I’m going to give each of you a tub containing 50 rubber ducks and a cashbox containing 50 tickets and a twenty-dollar ‘change float’. “Each duck has been pre-numbered, corresponding to a matching ticket number. The ducks sell for $5.00 each. So, when a customer gives you the money to buy a duck, you give them the duck and the half of the ticket that matches up with the number on the duck, placing the other ticket-half back in the cashbox. Along with the money, of course.” The teenagers nodded, trying not to look too confused. “The ducks have been prearranged in the tubs to correspond to the numerical order of the tickets in the cashboxes – to make it easier for you … kids.” He smiled proudly. It was a foolproof system he’d personally invented for the event. “But make sure you always visually match up the duck and the ticket number before you hand them over to a customer, just to make sure.” Emma sighed, and stuck her hand halfway up into the air. “Uh, yes, Emma?” “What’re we getting paid for doing all this?” Bethany laughed. “Nobody’s getting paid,” Milton responded, his face turning red. “We’re all volunteers, as you know. If we sell all 10,000 rubber ducks during the course of the fair, we’ll raise $40,000 for the Children’s Hospital. The other $10,000 going to the owner of the duck that crosses the finish line first – after they’re all dumped into the river on Sunday. Yes, Tim?” “We gettin’ any lunch?” Tim was large for his age, and getting larger every day. “You’re free to purchase food from the various concession stands on the Fair Grounds.” Emma snorted and rolled her eyes. She slumped out of her black backpack. Bethany smugly patted the shiny pink purse looped over her shoulder. “Lucky I came prepared,” Tim grinned. He pulled a large paper sack out from under his sweatshirt and shook it happily. The tent was small, green and stuffy, even with the flaps open at the front. Across the front of the tent was a long wooden table, which is where the four teenagers took up their duck-selling stations – Emma on the far left end, and then Bethany, Tim and Connor. And as it was already fast-approaching 9:00 a.m., Milton quickly distributed one cashbox and one tub of ducks to each of his four fellow volunteers. The cashboxes went on top of the table, the tubs underneath. Milton then retreated to the card table he’d set up for himself at the back of the tent. On it was a laptop computer, tickets, deposit books and bank bags. The extra tubs of ducks were stacked in behind and to the sides, in precise order. When all the ducks in a tub had been sold, the seller was to come back to Milton and give him the cashbox and tub. The man would then take out and count the money and the tickets, which would add up to $270 along with 50 tickets, respectively. He would then replenish the cashbox with the change float and a fresh set of tickets, giving out the corresponding tub of ducks to be sold. The system worked fine. And the rubber ducks sold steadily, if not spectacularly. “Sheesh!” Tim exhaled, wiping his brow with a beefy hand. “This is hot, hard work. I sure am hungry.” Connor looked around his friend’s bulk. He saw Emma kicking an empty tub towards Mr. Siegfried, while Bethany played with her new cellphone. “Cover me,” he whispered to Tim. “I’m going to the bathroom.” “But it’s almost noon!” Tim protested. “When you gotta go …” Conner grinned. He latched and patted his cashbox. He then waved at his friend and slipped around the right-hand edge of the table, around the open tent flap. With no one to talk to, Tim scooped up his paper sack full of snacks from under the table. And the overloaded feedbag promptly burst open at the bottom, spilling candy, chocolate bars, and canned drinks all over the ground. “Oops!” the husky teenager gulped, diving down under the table to retrieve his eats. He was just brushing the grass off the knees of his sweatpants when Connor returned. Connor shook his head and grinned at his friend, then unlatched his cashbox. “Hey!” he yelped. The cashbox was empty of money, just unsold tickets left. Milton Siegfried’s bony head shot up from the tub of ducks he’d been counting, which he was about to hand to Emma. He hurried over to Connor at the front of the tent, and anxiously asked, “What happened?” The teenager grimaced. “Someone stole all the bills and coins out of my cashbox … when I went to the bathroom. I wasn’t gone more than a couple of minutes.” Sweat pimpled Milton’s tall forehead. He rifled through the remaining duck tickets in the otherwise empty cashbox, counting 24. Then he stared, panic-stricken, at Connor, Tim, Bethany and Emma. Connor sheepishly turned out the pockets of his patched-up shorts and shrugged his shoulders, plucking at his worn-thin-through-washing t-shirt. “I didn’t see any customers go near Connor’s cashbox,” Tim offered, chewing on a chocolate bar … “I would have seen their legs out front from under the table.” Bethany tossed her head back and smirked, “And I certainly don’t need any measly hundred-and-fifty dollars or whatever.” “I guess someone can afford to repair their bike now,” Emma commented laconically. Milton licked his lips. His voice squeaked when he said, “I, uh, guess I’ll just have to search everyone’s belongings and … persons – to determine who took the money.” Bethany giggled, and Milton’s face turned red. Emma kicked her backpack further under the table. “Unless you got a search warrant, beanpole,” she said defiantly, “you aren’t going through my backpack – or person.” Milton stared blankly at his four charges – that he was responsible for – thinking about the missing money that he was also responsible for. And then, suddenly, a gleam of light shone in his pale blue eyes behind the metal frames. “That actually won’t be necessary,” he stated. “Because I know who took the money.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Who could have taken the money? \n    •  A casual fair-goer is virtually impossible, because a customer would have had to come in behind the sales table, lift the cash-box lid, scoop out the contents and leave again, all inside a crowded, eye-level tent, yet no one saw anyone in front of the table.  \n    •  Therefore the thief must be one of the four teenagers.\n\n2.  Motives.  \n    •  Connor – needs money to repair his bicycle, but he deliberately left the box and walked away.  If he had meant to steal it himself he would have pocketed the cash gradually, not announce that he was leaving the box unattended.  \n    •  Bethany – openly says she has plenty of money and shows off an expensive phone and purse.  \n    •  Emma – is the only one who actually asked about being paid, but at the moment of the theft she was at the back of the tent, handing her empty tub and cash-box to Milton.  \n    •  Tim – has already complained several times about food, produced a sack of snacks, and is physically big enough to block the view of what he is doing.  Most of all, he would like a quick, easy source of spending money for more food.\n\n3.  Opportunity (timing & position).  \n    •  Layout: Emma – Bethany – Tim – Connor, left-to-right behind the table.  \n    •  When Connor left for the toilet he went out of the flap on the extreme right.  \n    •  At that precise moment:  \n          – Emma kicked her empty tub toward Milton and walked to the back with it; she was not near Connor’s station.  \n          – Bethany was absorbed with her new mobile and never left her spot; to reach Connor’s box she would have had to step in front of Tim’s place and would have been seen.  \n          – Tim’s snack sack split; he ducked under the table to pick everything up.  While crouched there he was hidden from everyone, and he was the only person close enough to reach Connor’s cash-box without being seen.  From beneath the table he could simply slide the box down, empty out the loose cash (and the sold ticket stubs that lay loose with it), push the still-latched box back up and stand again, all before Connor returned.\n\n4.  Milton’s deduction.  \n    •  He knew exactly when the money vanished – inside the two-minute interval while Connor was away.  \n    •  He personally watched Emma handing him her tub at the back; she was in his sight the whole time.  \n    •  He could see Bethany from where he was sitting; she never moved away from her station.  \n    •  Tim, however, disappeared under the table – the one unseen place – at precisely the right moment.  \n    •  Therefore, without any search, Milton can name the only person who both had a motive and a completely un-observed chance: Tim.\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nConnor, Tim, Bethany, Emma\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTim\n</CULPRIT>\n\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1.  Just before noon Connor latches his cash-box and heads round the right-hand side of the tent to the toilets.  \n2.  Seconds later Tim’s overloaded food sack gives way.  The “accident” is no accident – it is Tim’s cover.  \n3.  He drops to his knees, then crawls under the table, apparently gathering his scattered snacks.  \n4.  Hidden by the table-front and by his own body, Tim quietly lifts Connor’s cash-box down, flips the catch, scoops out the loose notes, coins and sold ticket halves, stuffs them into the torn snack sack (or a pocket), re-latches the now-empty box and puts it back on the table.  \n5.  He emerges, still pretending to clean grass from his knees, just as Connor walks back in.  \n6.  Connor opens the box, finds it empty, and raises the alarm.  Tim, mouth full of chocolate, announces that he “would have seen anyone’s legs out front”, hoping to steer suspicion toward an imaginary customer and away from himself.  \n7.  Milton mentally reconstructs the two-minute interval, realises the only person out of sight was Tim, and identifies him as the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Connor – was out of the tent the whole time; if he had wanted the money he could simply have slipped it into his pockets instead of leaving it behind and drawing attention to its absence.  \n•  Bethany – never left her station; Milton could see her the entire time and she could not have reached over two places without being noticed.  \n•  Emma – was standing beside Milton at the back of the tent with her own tub and cash-box while the theft occurred; Milton had her in full view.  \nTherefore none of them had both the opportunity and invisibility needed to open the cash-box unobserved; only Tim did.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Milton determined this was the missing total when he counted 24 remaining duck tickets in the cashbox: meaning, 26 tickets sold x $5.00/ticket + $20.00 change float = $150.00 in stolen money.",

It was a foolproof system he’d personally invented for the event. “But make sure you always visually match up the duck and the ticket number before you hand them over to a customer, just to make sure.” Emma sighed, and stuck her hand halfway up into the air. “Uh, yes, Emma?” “What’re we getting paid for doing all this?” Bethany laughed. “Nobody’s getting paid,” Milton responded, his face turning red. “We’re all volunteers, as you know. If we sell all 10,000 rubber ducks during the course of the fair, we’ll raise $40,000 for the Children’s Hospital. The other $10,000 going to the owner of the duck that crosses the finish line first – after they’re all dumped into the river on Sunday. Yes, Tim?” “We gettin’ any lunch?” Tim was large for his age, and getting larger every day. “You’re free to purchase food from the various concession stands on the Fair Grounds.” Emma snorted and rolled her eyes. She slumped out of her black backpack. Bethany smugly patted the shiny pink purse looped over her shoulder. “Lucky I came prepared,” Tim grinned. He pulled a large paper sack out from under his sweatshirt and shook it happily. The tent was small, green and stuffy, even with the flaps open at the front. Across the front of the tent was a long wooden table, which is where the four teenagers took up their duck-selling stations – Emma on the far left end, and then Bethany, Tim and Connor. And as it was already fast-approaching 9:00 a.m., Milton quickly distributed one cashbox and one tub of ducks to each of his four fellow volunteers. The cashboxes went on top of the table, the tubs underneath. Milton then retreated to the card table he’d set up for himself at the back of the tent. On it was a laptop computer, tickets, deposit books and bank bags. The extra tubs of ducks were stacked in behind and to the sides, in precise order. When all the ducks in a tub had been sold, the seller was to come back to Milton and give him the cashbox and tub. The man would then take out and count the money and the tickets, which would add up to $270 along with 50 tickets, respectively. He would then replenish the cashbox with the change float and a fresh set of tickets, giving out the corresponding tub of ducks to be sold. The system worked fine. And the rubber ducks sold steadily, if not spectacularly. “Sheesh!” Tim exhaled, wiping his brow with a beefy hand. “This is hot, hard work. I sure am hungry.” Connor looked around his friend’s bulk. He saw Emma kicking an empty tub towards Mr. Siegfried, while Bethany played with her new cellphone. “Cover me,” he whispered to Tim. “I’m going to the bathroom.” “But it’s almost noon!” Tim protested. “When you gotta go …” Conner grinned. He latched and patted his cashbox. He then waved at his friend and slipped around the right-hand edge of the table, around the open tent flap. With no one to talk to, Tim scooped up his paper sack full of snacks from under the table. And the overloaded feedbag promptly burst open at the bottom, spilling candy, chocolate bars, and canned drinks all over the ground. “Oops!” the husky teenager gulped, diving down under the table to retrieve his eats. He was just brushing the grass off the knees of his sweatpants when Connor returned. Connor shook his head and grinned at his friend, then unlatched his cashbox. “Hey!” he yelped. The cashbox was empty of money, just unsold tickets left. Milton Siegfried’s bony head shot up from the tub of ducks he’d been counting, which he was about to hand to Emma. He hurried over to Connor at the front of the tent, and anxiously asked, “What happened?” The teenager grimaced. “Someone stole all the bills and coins out of my cashbox … when I went to the bathroom. I wasn’t gone more than a couple of minutes.” Sweat pimpled Milton’s tall forehead. He rifled through the remaining duck tickets in the otherwise empty cashbox, counting 24. Then he stared, panic-stricken, at Connor, Tim, Bethany and Emma. Connor sheepishly turned out the pockets of his patched-up shorts and shrugged his shoulders, plucking at his worn-thin-through-washing t-shirt. “I didn’t see any customers go near Connor’s cashbox,” Tim offered, chewing on a chocolate bar … “I would have seen their legs out front from under the table.” Bethany tossed her head back and smirked, “And I certainly don’t need any measly hundred-and-fifty dollars or whatever.” “I guess someone can afford to repair their bike now,” Emma commented laconically. Milton licked his lips. His voice squeaked when he said, “I, uh, guess I’ll just have to search everyone’s belongings and … persons – to determine who took the money.” Bethany giggled, and Milton’s face turned red. Emma kicked her backpack further under the table. “Unless you got a search warrant, beanpole,” she said defiantly, “you aren’t going through my backpack – or person.” Milton stared blankly at his four charges – that he was responsible for – thinking about the missing money that he was also responsible for. And then, suddenly, a gleam of light shone in his pale blue eyes behind the metal frames. “That actually won’t be necessary,” he stated. “Because I know who took the money.”",

      "answer": "(a) Bethany",
      "outcome": "No customers were near Connor’s end of the table during the minutes he was away from his cashbox. It had to be an ‘inside job’ – one of the four teenagers took the money. Not Tim, since he was on the ground gathering up his junk food the whole time. Not Emma, as she was with Milton Siegfried. Connor could have taken the money and just faked his surprise when he reported the theft, but when he emptied his pockets and plucked out his t-shirt, it seemed to indicate that he had no place to hide a sizable wad of cash and coins.\nLeaving Bethany, who somehow knew the exact total of the missing money, $150, which she blurted out. Milton determined this was the missing total when he counted 24 remaining duck tickets in the cashbox: meaning, 26 tickets sold x $5.00/ticket + $20.00 change float = $150.00 in stolen money."
