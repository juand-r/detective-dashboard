    "full_text": "Who would have thought that this intolerable job would give me the chance to show my skills as a detective? Not me! The paper is sending someone over to interview me shortly, so I’ve got just enough time to tell you what happened. I’m Sam Jaspers, and I work the night shift, cleaning up and washing the dishes here at the Palace Diner. Some Palace! The counters are so old that the yellow stains are permanent. The regulars would miss them if they ever got scrubbed away, my boss said. Oh yes, the boss (and chef) is Tom Greene. He has owned the place for years. Some say he won it in a crap game. If you ask me, I bet he lost the crap game, and had to take it over! But, as I was saying, I clean the place during the night shift, from 11:00 p.m. to six o’clock in the morning. There’s nobody here after 2:00 a.m., except the occasional trucker, or student pulling an all-nighter to study for exams. My work is really done by around 3:00 a.m., so I get to put in a couple of hours studying, too. I catch up on sleep in the afternoon, after classes. I’m at the university on the top of the hill. But my “scholarship” comes from working at the Palace Diner! Anyway, last night Tom Greene left early. There was just one regular, Mary Ingram, in the restaurant then, around midnight I’d say. The waitress on duty was Louisa Perry. Typically, after Tom leaves, she does whatever short order cooking is necessary, from a grill behind the counter. Well, last night a college student I know, John Beddington, came in to have a cup of coffee, and to fill me in on an assignment that I had missed. I was there in class, but slept through the lecture! Let’s see, the only other person there wasn’t a regular, but she struck up a talk with Mary, and then shared her table. She said her name was Sarah Upton. At one o’clock things had calmed down considerably, so I decided to clean the rest rooms, the one chore I really hate. But it’s a matter of pride to do it right. I did the men’s room first. Then, as usual, I checked with Louisa, and she went into the ladies’ room, opening the door and calling to make sure the room was empty. It was. Then Louisa went back to the counter, and I put my sign on the outer door, then went in and started to clean, the sinks and whatnot. Well, when I do a job, I do it carefully. So it wasn’t long before I saw, hanging on a hook inside the last toilet stall on the other side of the faucets, a handbag. Actually, it looked like a tapestry bag, rather large, with colorful designs. I took a peek inside the bag. It was full of money! I didn’t want to count it then and there. I was on the verge of coming out, when I remembered -- there had been an old lady earlier, who had trouble getting around. She had a walker. I remembered seeing her with that tapestry bag. Her bag was hung up on the back of her booth. Then it hit me -- it had still been there when she left! I didn’t think anything of it at the time. For one thing, lost and found is not my concern. The waitresses usually take care of that sort of problem, taking possession of anything that has been lost by mistake. And I’m too busy with my own chores to bother looking for new ones. But this was odd. Then I thought of something else. I hadn’t remembered the old lady going to the ladies’ room. Come to think of it, she couldn’t have gone, even if she wanted to. There are steps that a handicapped person couldn’t climb. I always thought this would get Tom Greene in big trouble, since there are public access laws in this state, but it hadn’t yet. Maybe we were too small and insignificant to bother with. Or maybe the people who do the enforcing hadn’t had the pleasure of real world eating at the Palace Diner! Anyway, this was an emergency, so I did what Tom always told his new employees to do (but never expected that anyone would really ever do): I got out my cell phone and called him at home. I was in luck. He wasn’t asleep yet. He took it all in, thought a minute, and then asked me to count the money. I did -- it was more than one thousand dollars! There were also some family pictures in the bag, one of them of the old lady herself. And, of course, there was a name and an address. She would have no trouble getting her property back. Tom was pleased. He told me to take possession of the bag, and that he’d be back at the diner inside an hour. I wrapped the tapestry bag up in some large vacuum cleaner bags that were on my cleaning cart. I unlocked my locker, got out a history book, put the tapestry bag into my locker, and went to a back table with my history book. I planned to get in some reading for class before Tom returned. When I looked around, there was Louisa at the counter, with a clear view of both rest rooms. She was doing some inventory work for the day shift, orders to be made for butter, hamburger, rolls and cheese, probably. We sell a lot of cheeseburgers during the night shift, and Tom monitors all supplies carefully. John came back to say good night, and with a yawn, said he was heading back up the hill, to his dormitory. I thanked him again for his help with the assignment. He said it was nothing, and also mentioned that we served the worst cup of coffee he’d ever had! Mary Ingram finished her third cup of coffee, then went back to the ladies’ room. Had I remembered? Yes, I had taken the “No Admission” sign off the door. Wearing fresh makeup, Mary came out a few minutes later, said a cheery good night to Louisa and me, and left the diner. “See you again tonight,” she waved. She was always there. We were, she pointed out, her family, after all. That left Sarah Upton, and I felt almost sorry for her. She clearly didn’t want to leave, and seemed to have no place to go. She seemed to postpone leaving as long as she could. After Mary left she went up to the counter, but Louisa’s foul mood discouraged conversation. Sarah Upton tried to pull herself and her remaining dignity together, and with a shrug of the shoulders, waved a goodbye to me, and left the diner. At that point, Tom Greene entered. He quickly came over to me. I nodded, to assure him that I had the tapestry bag, safe and sound. “But I can do better than that, Tom. I know who the thief was, too!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Where did the money bag come from?  \n   • The elderly woman with the walker had carried it.  \n   • She never entered the ladies’ room (she could not climb the steps).  \n   • Therefore she could not be the one who hung it in the last stall; someone else had to move it.\n\n2. When could it have been moved?  \n   • Between the moment the old lady left (bag still hanging on her booth) and 1:00 a.m., when Sam began to clean the rest-rooms.  \n   • During that interval the only people present were: waitress Louisa Perry, regular customer Mary Ingram, newcomer Sarah Upton and student John Beddington.\n\n3. Who could safely carry the big tapestry bag into the ladies’ room without creating a scene?  \n   • A woman has a natural reason to enter the ladies’ room; a man would look conspicuous.  \n   • That narrows the realistic movers to Louisa, Mary or Sarah.\n\n4. The decisive clue – who tried to pick it up again?  \n   • After Sam removed the bag and locked it away, only one person went back into the ladies’ room: Mary Ingram.  \n   • She emerged a few minutes later and hurried out, offering a cheerful but abrupt goodbye.  \n   • If she were innocent she would have had no reason to re-enter; the thief, however, would naturally return for the hidden loot.\n\n5. Why not Louisa or Sarah?  \n   • Louisa never left the counter after Sam removed the bag; she could see both rest-room doors.  \n   • Sarah Upton never entered the ladies’ room after the bag had disappeared; she lingered at the counter and eventually walked out empty-handed.  \n   • Only Mary acted exactly as the thwarted thief would.\n\n6. Motive & opportunity for Mary  \n   • She had been sitting in the same booth area as the elderly woman’s bag.  \n   • She knew the floor plan and could easily hide the bag where she thought no one would notice until she reclaimed it.  \n   • Regular customers sometimes feel “at home” enough to attempt such a risk, especially late at night with little staff on duty.\n\nHence every physical, temporal and behavioural clue points to Mary Ingram.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLouisa Perry, Mary Ingram, Sarah Upton, John Beddington, Tom Greene\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMary Ingram\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly after midnight the elderly woman with the walker finished her meal and left, accidentally leaving her large tapestry handbag hanging on the back of the booth.  \nMary Ingram, drinking coffee in the next booth and chatting with Sarah Upton, noticed the forgotten bag, peeked inside, saw the large roll of cash and decided to steal it.  \nTo keep it hidden until she was ready to leave, Mary carried the tapestry bag into the ladies’ room and hung it on the hook inside the farthest stall. She then returned to the dining area as though nothing had happened.  \nAround 1:00 a.m. Sam closed the ladies’ room for cleaning, found the hidden bag and—after telephoning the owner—locked it away in his locker.  \nUnaware of this, Mary later excused herself, walked back into the ladies’ room to retrieve the loot, discovered it gone, repaired her make-up to cover her agitation and hurried out of the diner, bidding everyone a quick good night.  \nMoments later the owner Tom Greene arrived, and Sam was able to identify Mary as the only person who both had the opportunity to hide the bag and subsequently tried to reclaim it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Louisa Perry – She was behind the counter the whole time after the bag was secured and never re-entered the ladies’ room; moreover, if she had been the thief she would have known immediately that the bag was gone when Sam carried it past her view.  \n• Sarah Upton – Although she was seated near Mary, she never went back into the ladies’ room after Sam’s cleaning; she left the diner empty-handed and disappointed.  \n• John Beddington – He is male (unlikely to walk into the ladies’ room unnoticed) and had already left the diner before Sam finished cleaning.  \n• Tom Greene – He was not in the diner during the critical time period and returned only after Sam phoned him.  \nTherefore none of them had both the actions and the behaviour that fit the thief; only Mary Ingram did.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Louisa Perry, the waitress, tried to steal the bag full of money. She noticed it had been left when the old lady exited the diner. She thought the safest place to hide the bag was in the ladies’ room. If it were found in her locker, there would be no defense to a larceny charge.\nSince she had a clear view of both rest rooms from her station, Louisa would have noticed if John Beddington had, by mistake, gone into the ladies’ room.\nSarah Upton did not use the ladies’ room before she left the diner. That eliminates her as a suspect, as she would have gone to the ladies’ room to retrieve the bag had she stolen it.\nMary Ingram used the ladies’ room before she left the diner. She freshened her makeup. However, she showed no signs of concern as she said good night to the waitress and custodian, as she would have done if she had searched in vain for the stolen handbag.\nOn the contrary, it was Louisa the waitress who was curt to the point of rudeness when the last customer left. Waitresses depend upon tips for their income, and are cheerful whether they feel that way or not. Clearly, she wanted the last customer to clear out, so that she could go back to the ladies’ room. Plus, Sam points out that waitresses are responsible for lost and found items.\nIt was Sam’s conscientious work ethic that enabled him to find the handbag, solve the case, and when a delighted university president read about it in the Daily Clarion later that week, receive a room and board scholarship that put an end to his late nights as custodian of the Palace Diner.",

When I looked around, there was Louisa at the counter, with a clear view of both rest rooms. She was doing some inventory work for the day shift, orders to be made for butter, hamburger, rolls and cheese, probably. We sell a lot of cheeseburgers during the night shift, and Tom monitors all supplies carefully. John came back to say good night, and with a yawn, said he was heading back up the hill, to his dormitory. I thanked him again for his help with the assignment. He said it was nothing, and also mentioned that we served the worst cup of coffee he’d ever had! Mary Ingram finished her third cup of coffee, then went back to the ladies’ room. Had I remembered? Yes, I had taken the “No Admission” sign off the door. Wearing fresh makeup, Mary came out a few minutes later, said a cheery good night to Louisa and me, and left the diner. “See you again tonight,” she waved. She was always there. We were, she pointed out, her family, after all. That left Sarah Upton, and I felt almost sorry for her. She clearly didn’t want to leave, and seemed to have no place to go. She seemed to postpone leaving as long as she could. After Mary left she went up to the counter, but Louisa’s foul mood discouraged conversation. Sarah Upton tried to pull herself and her remaining dignity together, and with a shrug of the shoulders, waved a goodbye to me, and left the diner. At that point, Tom Greene entered. He quickly came over to me. I nodded, to assure him that I had the tapestry bag, safe and sound. “But I can do better than that, Tom. I know who the thief was, too!”",
      "answer_options": "(a) John Beddington; (b) Louisa Perry; (c) Mary Ingram; (d) Sarah Upton",
      "answer": "(b) Louisa Perry",
      "outcome": "Louisa Perry, the waitress, tried to steal the bag full of money. She noticed it had been left when the old lady exited the diner. She thought the safest place to hide the bag was in the ladies’ room. If it were found in her locker, there would be no defense to a larceny charge.\nSince she had a clear view of both rest rooms from her station, Louisa would have noticed if John Beddington had, by mistake, gone into the ladies’ room.\nSarah Upton did not use the ladies’ room before she left the diner. That eliminates her as a suspect, as she would have gone to the ladies’ room to retrieve the bag had she stolen it.\nMary Ingram used the ladies’ room before she left the diner. She freshened her makeup. However, she showed no signs of concern as she said good night to the waitress and custodian, as she would have done if she had searched in vain for the stolen handbag.\nOn the contrary, it was Louisa the waitress who was curt to the point of rudeness when the last customer left. Waitresses depend upon tips for their income, and are cheerful whether they feel that way or not. Clearly, she wanted the last customer to clear out, so that she could go back to the ladies’ room. Plus, Sam points out that waitresses are responsible for lost and found items.\nIt was Sam’s conscientious work ethic that enabled him to find the handbag, solve the case, and when a delighted university president read about it in the Daily Clarion later that week, receive a room and board scholarship that put an end to his late nights as custodian of the Palace Diner."
