    "full_text": "Who would have thought that this intolerable job would give me the chance to show my skills as a detective? Not me! The paper is sending someone over to interview me shortly, so I’ve got just enough time to tell you what happened. I’m Sam Jaspers, and I work the night shift, cleaning up and washing the dishes here at the Palace Diner. Some Palace! The counters are so old that the yellow stains are permanent. The regulars would miss them if they ever got scrubbed away, my boss said. Oh yes, the boss (and chef) is Tom Greene. He has owned the place for years. Some say he won it in a crap game. If you ask me, I bet he lost the crap game, and had to take it over! But, as I was saying, I clean the place during the night shift, from 11:00 p.m. to six o’clock in the morning. There’s nobody here after 2:00 a.m., except the occasional trucker, or student pulling an all-nighter to study for exams. My work is really done by around 3:00 a.m., so I get to put in a couple of hours studying, too. I catch up on sleep in the afternoon, after classes. I’m at the university on the top of the hill. But my “scholarship” comes from working at the Palace Diner! Anyway, last night Tom Greene left early. There was just one regular, Mary Ingram, in the restaurant then, around midnight I’d say. The waitress on duty was Louisa Perry. Typically, after Tom leaves, she does whatever short order cooking is necessary, from a grill behind the counter. Well, last night a college student I know, John Beddington, came in to have a cup of coffee, and to fill me in on an assignment that I had missed. I was there in class, but slept through the lecture! Let’s see, the only other person there wasn’t a regular, but she struck up a talk with Mary, and then shared her table. She said her name was Sarah Upton. At one o’clock things had calmed down considerably, so I decided to clean the rest rooms, the one chore I really hate. But it’s a matter of pride to do it right. I did the men’s room first. Then, as usual, I checked with Louisa, and she went into the ladies’ room, opening the door and calling to make sure the room was empty. It was. Then Louisa went back to the counter, and I put my sign on the outer door, then went in and started to clean, the sinks and whatnot. Well, when I do a job, I do it carefully. So it wasn’t long before I saw, hanging on a hook inside the last toilet stall on the other side of the faucets, a handbag. Actually, it looked like a tapestry bag, rather large, with colorful designs. I took a peek inside the bag. It was full of money! I didn’t want to count it then and there. I was on the verge of coming out, when I remembered -- there had been an old lady earlier, who had trouble getting around. She had a walker. I remembered seeing her with that tapestry bag. Her bag was hung up on the back of her booth. Then it hit me -- it had still been there when she left! I didn’t think anything of it at the time. For one thing, lost and found is not my concern. The waitresses usually take care of that sort of problem, taking possession of anything that has been lost by mistake. And I’m too busy with my own chores to bother looking for new ones. But this was odd. Then I thought of something else. I hadn’t remembered the old lady going to the ladies’ room. Come to think of it, she couldn’t have gone, even if she wanted to. There are steps that a handicapped person couldn’t climb. I always thought this would get Tom Greene in big trouble, since there are public access laws in this state, but it hadn’t yet. Maybe we were too small and insignificant to bother with. Or maybe the people who do the enforcing hadn’t had the pleasure of real world eating at the Palace Diner! Anyway, this was an emergency, so I did what Tom always told his new employees to do (but never expected that anyone would really ever do): I got out my cell phone and called him at home. I was in luck. He wasn’t asleep yet. He took it all in, thought a minute, and then asked me to count the money. I did -- it was more than one thousand dollars! There were also some family pictures in the bag, one of them of the old lady herself. And, of course, there was a name and an address. She would have no trouble getting her property back. Tom was pleased. He told me to take possession of the bag, and that he’d be back at the diner inside an hour. I wrapped the tapestry bag up in some large vacuum cleaner bags that were on my cleaning cart. I unlocked my locker, got out a history book, put the tapestry bag into my locker, and went to a back table with my history book. I planned to get in some reading for class before Tom returned. When I looked around, there was Louisa at the counter, with a clear view of both rest rooms. She was doing some inventory work for the day shift, orders to be made for butter, hamburger, rolls and cheese, probably. We sell a lot of cheeseburgers during the night shift, and Tom monitors all supplies carefully. John came back to say good night, and with a yawn, said he was heading back up the hill, to his dormitory. I thanked him again for his help with the assignment. He said it was nothing, and also mentioned that we served the worst cup of coffee he’d ever had! Mary Ingram finished her third cup of coffee, then went back to the ladies’ room. Had I remembered? Yes, I had taken the “No Admission” sign off the door. Wearing fresh makeup, Mary came out a few minutes later, said a cheery good night to Louisa and me, and left the diner. “See you again tonight,” she waved. She was always there. We were, she pointed out, her family, after all. That left Sarah Upton, and I felt almost sorry for her. She clearly didn’t want to leave, and seemed to have no place to go. She seemed to postpone leaving as long as she could. After Mary left she went up to the counter, but Louisa’s foul mood discouraged conversation. Sarah Upton tried to pull herself and her remaining dignity together, and with a shrug of the shoulders, waved a goodbye to me, and left the diner. At that point, Tom Greene entered. He quickly came over to me. I nodded, to assure him that I had the tapestry bag, safe and sound. “But I can do better than that, Tom. I know who the thief was, too!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What crime has to be explained?  \n    Somebody took the old lady’s tapestry-handbag, stuffed with more than a thousand\n    dollars, and hid it in the last stall of the ladies’ room.  \n    Whoever did that intended to come back for it.\n\n2.  Facts that cannot be disputed  \n    •  The old woman could not have put it there (she could not climb the steps).  \n    •  At 1:00 a.m. Louisa opened the ladies’-room door, called inside and found no one\n       there – yet the bag was already hanging in the far stall.  \n    •  Sam found the bag a few minutes after 1:00.  \n    •  After Sam finished, removed the “No Admission” sign and locked the bag away,\n       only one customer made a quick trip to the ladies’ room – Mary Ingram.  \n    •  A few minutes later, disappointed Sarah Upton left; she never went near the\n       ladies’ room after the sign came down.  \n    •  John Beddington (male) could not enter the ladies’ room unnoticed.  \n    •  Louisa stood at the counter with an unobstructed view of both wash-rooms from\n       the moment Sam started cleaning until Mary’s visit, so no one could have\n       slipped into the ladies’ room during that interval.\n\n3.  Opportunity – who could have put the bag in the stall BEFORE 1:00 a.m.?  \n    •  Louisa – she is female, knows the layout, but also knows Sam cleans the ladies’\n      room every night at 1:00 and would inevitably discover anything hidden there.  \n    •  Mary – was in the restaurant the whole time, is familiar with the\n      routine, and had at least one chance to go to the ladies’ room before Sam\n      blocked it off.  \n    •  Sarah – also had the physical opportunity, but as a first-time customer she\n      could not know Sam’s cleaning schedule, so she would take the risk of the bag\n      being discovered.  \n    •  John – cannot go into the ladies’ room inconspicuously.  \n    •  Sam and Tom – narrating detective & owner, no motive why they would hide it.\n\n4.  Behaviour after the bag had been hidden  \n    •  The real thief would naturally want to reclaim the bag as soon as the\n      wash-room reopened.  \n    •  When Sam took the “No Admission” sign down, only one person hurried into the\n      ladies’ room – Mary – and she emerged a couple of minutes later with *nothing*\n      in her hands and immediately decided to go home.  That looks exactly like\n      somebody who expected to find something that was no longer there.  \n    •  Sarah, the only other woman present, *did not* go to the ladies’ room.  She\n      simply left, looking rather crest-fallen, but never tried to recover the bag.  \n    •  Louisa could have fetched the bag at any moment after Sam had locked it away\n      (she had the keys to the employee lockers while Sam was busy), yet she made no\n      move at all.\n\n5.  Motive  \n    Mary is described as a lonely regular who practically lives at the diner.  An\n    unattended handbag bulging with cash would be a strong temptation.  She also\n    knew Sam’s nightly cleaning routine – perfect knowledge for hiding the bag until\n    near closing time.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMary Ingram, Louisa Perry, Sarah Upton, John Beddington, Tom Greene, Sam Jaspers\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMary Ingram\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Shortly before midnight an elderly, handicapped woman finished her meal, paid,\n   and struggled out of the Palace Diner, accidentally leaving her large tapestry\n   handbag hanging on the back of her booth.  \n•  Mary Ingram, a nightly regular, noticed the forgotten bag, opened it, and found\n   a thick wad of money.  \n•  Knowing that Sam always cleans the ladies’ room around 1 a.m., Mary carried the\n   handbag into the far stall of that wash-room and hung it on the hook, planning\n   to reclaim it after the cleaning was over and just before she went home.  \n•  At 1:00 a.m. Sam began his routine, blocked off the ladies’ room, and discovered\n   the hidden bag.  \n•  He telephoned Tom, wrapped the bag, locked it in his locker, removed the sign,\n   and sat down to study.  \n•  Convinced that the coast was clear, Mary trotted straight to the ladies’ room to\n   retrieve her loot, only to find the stall empty.  She applied some make-up to\n   mask her anger and disappointment, returned, wished everyone a cheerful good\n   night, and left the diner.  \n•  A few minutes later Tom arrived, and Sam was able to tell him who the thief had\n   been and why.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Louisa Perry: She knows the rest-room-cleaning routine better than anyone; she\n  would never hide stolen property where Sam was certain to find it minutes later.\n  Her continuous presence behind the counter (noted by Sam) also left her no\n  unnoticed opportunity to carry the bulky tapestry bag to the ladies’ room.  \n\n•  Sarah Upton: Although she had the physical opportunity beforehand, she made no\n  attempt to enter the ladies’ room once it reopened, which the real thief would\n  certainly have done.  Her reluctance to leave is explained by having nowhere\n  else to go, not by waiting for the bag.  \n\n•  John Beddington: As a male he could not reasonably use the ladies’ room as a\n  hiding place, and Sam saw him leave before the bag could have been recovered.  \n\n•  Tom Greene: Was at home the entire time and only entered the diner after Sam\n  had secured the handbag.  No opportunity.  \n\n•  Sam Jaspers: Narrator, found the bag, reported it immediately, and locked it\n  away.  His actions are inconsistent with the behaviour of a thief.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Louisa Perry, the waitress, tried to steal the bag full of money. She noticed it had been left when the old lady exited the diner. She thought the safest place to hide the bag was in the ladies’ room. If it were found in her locker, there would be no defense to a larceny charge.\nSince she had a clear view of both rest rooms from her station, Louisa would have noticed if John Beddington had, by mistake, gone into the ladies’ room.\nSarah Upton did not use the ladies’ room before she left the diner. That eliminates her as a suspect, as she would have gone to the ladies’ room to retrieve the bag had she stolen it.\nMary Ingram used the ladies’ room before she left the diner. She freshened her makeup. However, she showed no signs of concern as she said good night to the waitress and custodian, as she would have done if she had searched in vain for the stolen handbag.\nOn the contrary, it was Louisa the waitress who was curt to the point of rudeness when the last customer left. Waitresses depend upon tips for their income, and are cheerful whether they feel that way or not. Clearly, she wanted the last customer to clear out, so that she could go back to the ladies’ room. Plus, Sam points out that waitresses are responsible for lost and found items.\nIt was Sam’s conscientious work ethic that enabled him to find the handbag, solve the case, and when a delighted university president read about it in the Daily Clarion later that week, receive a room and board scholarship that put an end to his late nights as custodian of the Palace Diner.",

At one o’clock things had calmed down considerably, so I decided to clean the rest rooms, the one chore I really hate. But it’s a matter of pride to do it right. I did the men’s room first. Then, as usual, I checked with Louisa, and she went into the ladies’ room, opening the door and calling to make sure the room was empty. It was. Then Louisa went back to the counter, and I put my sign on the outer door, then went in and started to clean, the sinks and whatnot. Well, when I do a job, I do it carefully. So it wasn’t long before I saw, hanging on a hook inside the last toilet stall on the other side of the faucets, a handbag. Actually, it looked like a tapestry bag, rather large, with colorful designs. I took a peek inside the bag. It was full of money! I didn’t want to count it then and there. I was on the verge of coming out, when I remembered -- there had been an old lady earlier, who had trouble getting around. She had a walker. I remembered seeing her with that tapestry bag. Her bag was hung up on the back of her booth. Then it hit me -- it had still been there when she left! I didn’t think anything of it at the time. For one thing, lost and found is not my concern. The waitresses usually take care of that sort of problem, taking possession of anything that has been lost by mistake. And I’m too busy with my own chores to bother looking for new ones. But this was odd. Then I thought of something else. I hadn’t remembered the old lady going to the ladies’ room. Come to think of it, she couldn’t have gone, even if she wanted to. There are steps that a handicapped person couldn’t climb. I always thought this would get Tom Greene in big trouble, since there are public access laws in this state, but it hadn’t yet. Maybe we were too small and insignificant to bother with. Or maybe the people who do the enforcing hadn’t had the pleasure of real world eating at the Palace Diner! Anyway, this was an emergency, so I did what Tom always told his new employees to do (but never expected that anyone would really ever do): I got out my cell phone and called him at home. I was in luck. He wasn’t asleep yet. He took it all in, thought a minute, and then asked me to count the money. I did -- it was more than one thousand dollars! There were also some family pictures in the bag, one of them of the old lady herself. And, of course, there was a name and an address. She would have no trouble getting her property back. Tom was pleased. He told me to take possession of the bag, and that he’d be back at the diner inside an hour. I wrapped the tapestry bag up in some large vacuum cleaner bags that were on my cleaning cart. I unlocked my locker, got out a history book, put the tapestry bag into my locker, and went to a back table with my history book. I planned to get in some reading for class before Tom returned. When I looked around, there was Louisa at the counter, with a clear view of both rest rooms. She was doing some inventory work for the day shift, orders to be made for butter, hamburger, rolls and cheese, probably. We sell a lot of cheeseburgers during the night shift, and Tom monitors all supplies carefully. John came back to say good night, and with a yawn, said he was heading back up the hill, to his dormitory. I thanked him again for his help with the assignment. He said it was nothing, and also mentioned that we served the worst cup of coffee he’d ever had! Mary Ingram finished her third cup of coffee, then went back to the ladies’ room. Had I remembered? Yes, I had taken the “No Admission” sign off the door. Wearing fresh makeup, Mary came out a few minutes later, said a cheery good night to Louisa and me, and left the diner. “See you again tonight,” she waved. She was always there. We were, she pointed out, her family, after all. That left Sarah Upton, and I felt almost sorry for her. She clearly didn’t want to leave, and seemed to have no place to go. She seemed to postpone leaving as long as she could. After Mary left she went up to the counter, but Louisa’s foul mood discouraged conversation. Sarah Upton tried to pull herself and her remaining dignity together, and with a shrug of the shoulders, waved a goodbye to me, and left the diner. At that point, Tom Greene entered. He quickly came over to me. I nodded, to assure him that I had the tapestry bag, safe and sound. “But I can do better than that, Tom. I know who the thief was, too!”",
      "answer_options": "(a) John Beddington; (b) Louisa Perry; (c) Mary Ingram; (d) Sarah Upton",
      "answer": "(b) Louisa Perry",
      "outcome": "Louisa Perry, the waitress, tried to steal the bag full of money. She noticed it had been left when the old lady exited the diner. She thought the safest place to hide the bag was in the ladies’ room. If it were found in her locker, there would be no defense to a larceny charge.\nSince she had a clear view of both rest rooms from her station, Louisa would have noticed if John Beddington had, by mistake, gone into the ladies’ room.\nSarah Upton did not use the ladies’ room before she left the diner. That eliminates her as a suspect, as she would have gone to the ladies’ room to retrieve the bag had she stolen it.\nMary Ingram used the ladies’ room before she left the diner. She freshened her makeup. However, she showed no signs of concern as she said good night to the waitress and custodian, as she would have done if she had searched in vain for the stolen handbag.\nOn the contrary, it was Louisa the waitress who was curt to the point of rudeness when the last customer left. Waitresses depend upon tips for their income, and are cheerful whether they feel that way or not. Clearly, she wanted the last customer to clear out, so that she could go back to the ladies’ room. Plus, Sam points out that waitresses are responsible for lost and found items.\nIt was Sam’s conscientious work ethic that enabled him to find the handbag, solve the case, and when a delighted university president read about it in the Daily Clarion later that week, receive a room and board scholarship that put an end to his late nights as custodian of the Palace Diner."
