    "full_text": "\"I'm proud of my dog,\" said Mark. \"Macca's my dog too!\" shouted Taylor. Mark and Taylor lived with their parents on a farm near the woods. Mark had gotten a puppy for his birthday two years ago, and now the puppy had grown into a proud-looking Husky. Mark agreed to let his younger sister Taylor help look after the dog, but Mark still always thought of Macca as belonging just to him. \"Macca likes everybody,\" Mark said. \"He likes me more!\" Taylor teased. Macca barked. \"He's agreeing with me!\" squealed Taylor. \"He is not,\" Mark laughed. But he was glad to have something to argue about, since it took his mind off the wintry cold. Dad had sent them down the driveway to pick up today's mail -- but their driveway was over a quarter of a mile long, and it was covered with snow. It ran between two fields where they'd grow strawberries in the spring, but now even those were also covered with snow. For the long, cold trip to the mail box, Mark and Taylor had brought Macca along to keep them company. Suddenly they saw an enormous paw print in the snow ahead of them. It had five toes -- like a person -- but each one ended with a sharp claw. \"It's huge!\" shouted Taylor. \"It's six inches long at least!\" Mark hurried to look around for the creature that made it, but all he saw was the afternoon sunlight on the snow, and bare tree trunks at the edge of the field. A trail of paw prints led off into the trees which grew thicker further up the hill, forming the beginning of a wide forest. \"Come on!\" said Taylor. \"Let's follow the paw prints.\" \"Let's not,\" said Mark. He knew what creature to which the paw prints belonged. \"It's Old Mugger.\" \"Who's Old Mugger?\" asked Taylor. Old Mugger was a giant black bear. Late one night last summer, the bear had surprised everybody -- including the farmers -- by making an unexpected attack from the forest. The bear started clawing a horse on the nearby farm, but the horse quickly galloped away. The clever horse had survived, but the next morning when the farmer woke up, he'd seen a trail of fierce claw marks running down the horse's side. Mark had seen the claw marks too -- and he'd known right then that he never wanted to meet Old Mugger the bear. There was more bad news that afternoon. After all that walking, Mark and Taylor discovered that their mailbox was empty. They'd walked a long way for nothing. As they headed back down the driveway, Mark wondered if that bear was still around. And then Macca suddenly started barking at something behind them. Had he seen the bear? Mark turned quickly to look, but it was just a truck coming up the road. Then he recognized the truck, and shouted excitedly to Taylor. \"It's the mailman! Maybe we'll get some mail after all!\" Taylor sighed loudly to show that she didn't want to walk back to the mailbox, and then said \"We have the fattest mailman ever.\" \"That's not polite,\" said Mark. \"But it's true,\" Taylor said smugly. Mark and Taylor watched as Orville, their mailman, struggled to gather up the mail in his truck. His truck tilted as Orville reached over for the magazines he was delivering, and then it tilted back the other way as he straightened up and stepped out its door. But then the magazines went flying into the air as Orville slipped and fell into the snow. \"Oof!\" said Orville, as his body plopped into a white snow drift. And magazines landed gently all around him. Taylor ran to pick up the magazines out of the snow. \"Thanks,\" said Orville. \"Dad doesn't like it when his magazines get wet,\" Taylor said, ignoring Orville altogether. She quickly scooped up all the magazines, then began running back to the house. Mark picked up two more letters that had fallen into the snow, as Orville stood up without saying anything, brushing the chunks of snow off his trousers. Then he noticed Mark's dog. \"His name's Macca,\" Mark said. \"Don't worry, he won't bite you.\" Macca barked playfully. \"Mailmen always worry about getting bitten by dogs,\" Orville said warily. \"Especially me -- I'm terrified of dogs, because I'm too fat to outrun them!\" Mark laughed, and said \"Don't worry. My dog's very well behaved -- and he's a purebred!\" Orville still had chunks of snow in his hair, but he tossed his head and looked strangely at the dog. \"Is that right?\" said Orville. \"My brother breeds dogs. He sells them to rich people who are looking for the purest breed of a dog. I bet your dog would be worth a lot of money!\" Mark laughed, but then realized that the mailman wasn't making a joke. \"My dog's not for sale!\" Mark said. Orville didn't say anything back. There was an awkward silence. Mark checked the ground for any more letters that their mailman had dropped, but Orville was already revving up the engine on his mail truck. Before Mark could say anything, Orville was already driving away down the road. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Back at the house, Mark told his father that he and Tina had seen been bear tracks in the snow. Mark's father looked worried, and his mother tried to change the subject. \"We need to take Macca to the vet soon for his annual check up!\" she said casually. But it didn't work. Mark was still worried about the bear. After dinner that night, Mark let Macca out into their back yard. \"I wouldn't sell you for a million dollars,\" he told his dog -- and Macca barked once, wagging his tail happily. The weather was unpredictable, and an inch of snow had already piled up on the tall fence that ran around their yard, so Mark was glad that Macca had a warm doghouse to sleep in. But that night, Mark had a nightmare. Macca was lost on their farm, and no matter how hard Mark looked, he couldn't find his beloved dog anywhere. Mark tried calling out for Macca in the night, but then he flopped down into a big drift of snow -- just like Orville their mailman had done that afternoon. In the dream, Mark's sister Taylor skipped up and stole all the mail out of Mark's hands. When Mark woke up that morning, he was in a frustrated mood. He leaped out of bed and went straight to the backyard to say hi to Macca. But Macca was gone. It had snowed in the night -- there were now two inches of snow along the fence around the yard. All sounds seemed to be muffled by the snow, filling the yard with a strange silence. An empty winter wind blew across the sunny sky. But there was no sign of Macca. \"Macca's missing!\" Mark said. \"Maybe a bear ate him,\" said Taylor. She was already awake, wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt that said, \"I WILL be seen and I WILL be heard.\" She'd come out of her room to see why Mark was upset. \"A bear did not eat my dog!\" Mark said angrily. But he ran out into the front yard to look for clues. All he saw was snow -- the driveway was completely covered with a smooth blanket, and it muffled all the sounds, making everything seem dangerously quiet. It was just like his nightmare last night... Suddenly Mark heard his dad's voice, shouting out from the house. \"It's too cold for you to be running around outside!\" \"But Dad!\" Mark shouted back. \"At least let me get your jackets out of your rooms.\" \"Dad!\" Mark said insistently. \"We need to talk to you!\" \"And I'm warm enough already,\" shouted Taylor. As they walked back to the house, Taylor asked \"Do you think mom just took Macca to the vet this morning?\" \"Or maybe Orville the mailman stole him,\" Mark said. \"He has a brother that sells dogs to rich people.\" But by the time they reached the house, Mark had suddenly put all the clues together. He turned to his father and said, \"Macca's gone from the back yard. And I know who's responsible!\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Orville has a clear financial motive (his brother sells pure-bred dogs).  \n   • A hungry bear would take a dog only for food, but it would leave signs of violence.  \n   • Mark’s parents have a protective motive: keep Macca safe from the increasing cold and from the rumored bear.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   • Orville would have to drive a truck up the long drive in the dark; fresh snow shows no tire tracks or footprints.  \n   • A bear (or any outside thief) would have to climb the fence, leaving tracks in the two inches of new snow—there are none.  \n   • Mom or Dad can step out the back door before the snowfall is finished, lift the latch, call the dog, and bring him inside; later snow erases their own footprints.\n\n3. Physical evidence / clues  \n   • Smooth, unbroken snow on the driveway and in the yard = nobody came from outside after the snowfall started.  \n   • No blood, no broken fencing, no scattered straw from the doghouse = no bear attack.  \n   • Dad repeatedly tells the children it is “too cold” outside and rushes to fetch their jackets.  Anyone that worried about the cold would have worried about Macca even more.  \n   • Mom merely “mentioned” a vet trip; Dad actively shows concern and takes action.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   a) If the dog left the yard before the snowfall, only a household member could have done it without leaving new tracks.  \n   b) Dad was the one overtly concerned about cold; the moment he shouts from the house, Mark sees the parallel: if it is too cold for the children, Dad must have thought it was too cold for Macca and taken him in.  \n   c) Therefore the person “responsible” for the dog’s disappearance from the yard is Dad.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDad (Mr. ­­­[surname not given]), Mom, Taylor, Orville the mailman, Orville’s dog-breeder brother, Old Mugger the bear\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDad (Mr. –, Mark and Taylor’s father)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring the evening, heavy snow and dropping temperatures made Dad uneasy about leaving Macca outside.  Remembering the freshly sighted bear tracks as well, he decided the dog would be safer and warmer indoors.  Before the worst of the snowfall, Dad slipped outside, opened the back-yard gate, called Macca, and led him into the house, perhaps into the mud-room or basement so he would not disturb the sleeping children.  Overnight two more inches of snow fell, wiping out Dad’s footprints.  In the morning Mark finds an empty yard and untouched snow and panics.  When Dad calls out, “It’s too cold for you to be running around outside!” and goes to fetch jackets, Mark suddenly realizes Dad would never have left the dog out in that same cold.  Macca is not lost or stolen at all—he is safe inside, thanks to Dad.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mom: There is no evidence she went anywhere that morning; she merely suggested a future vet visit.  \n• Taylor: She was still indoors, wearing only a T-shirt; she could not have crossed the snowy yard unnoticed.  \n• Orville: His truck would have left tracks on the long drive, and someone would have heard the engine.  The fresh, untouched snow rules him out.  \n• Orville’s brother: Never appears on scene; same lack-of-tracks argument applies.  \n• Old Mugger the bear: A bear would leave clawed prints, blood, torn fence boards or a damaged doghouse—none are present.  The yard snow is perfectly smooth.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

For the long, cold trip to the mail box, Mark and Taylor had brought Macca along to keep them company. Suddenly they saw an enormous paw print in the snow ahead of them. It had five toes -- like a person -- but each one ended with a sharp claw. \"It's huge!\" shouted Taylor. \"It's six inches long at least!\" Mark hurried to look around for the creature that made it, but all he saw was the afternoon sunlight on the snow, and bare tree trunks at the edge of the field. A trail of paw prints led off into the trees which grew thicker further up the hill, forming the beginning of a wide forest. \"Come on!\" said Taylor. \"Let's follow the paw prints.\" \"Let's not,\" said Mark. He knew what creature to which the paw prints belonged. \"It's Old Mugger.\" \"Who's Old Mugger?\" asked Taylor. Old Mugger was a giant black bear. Late one night last summer, the bear had surprised everybody -- including the farmers -- by making an unexpected attack from the forest. The bear started clawing a horse on the nearby farm, but the horse quickly galloped away. The clever horse had survived, but the next morning when the farmer woke up, he'd seen a trail of fierce claw marks running down the horse's side. Mark had seen the claw marks too -- and he'd known right then that he never wanted to meet Old Mugger the bear. There was more bad news that afternoon. After all that walking, Mark and Taylor discovered that their mailbox was empty. They'd walked a long way for nothing. As they headed back down the driveway, Mark wondered if that bear was still around. And then Macca suddenly started barking at something behind them. Had he seen the bear? Mark turned quickly to look, but it was just a truck coming up the road. Then he recognized the truck, and shouted excitedly to Taylor. \"It's the mailman! Maybe we'll get some mail after all!\" Taylor sighed loudly to show that she didn't want to walk back to the mailbox, and then said \"We have the fattest mailman ever.\" \"That's not polite,\" said Mark. \"But it's true,\" Taylor said smugly. Mark and Taylor watched as Orville, their mailman, struggled to gather up the mail in his truck. His truck tilted as Orville reached over for the magazines he was delivering, and then it tilted back the other way as he straightened up and stepped out its door. But then the magazines went flying into the air as Orville slipped and fell into the snow. \"Oof!\" said Orville, as his body plopped into a white snow drift. And magazines landed gently all around him. Taylor ran to pick up the magazines out of the snow. \"Thanks,\" said Orville. \"Dad doesn't like it when his magazines get wet,\" Taylor said, ignoring Orville altogether. She quickly scooped up all the magazines, then began running back to the house. Mark picked up two more letters that had fallen into the snow, as Orville stood up without saying anything, brushing the chunks of snow off his trousers. Then he noticed Mark's dog. \"His name's Macca,\" Mark said. \"Don't worry, he won't bite you.\" Macca barked playfully. \"Mailmen always worry about getting bitten by dogs,\" Orville said warily. \"Especially me -- I'm terrified of dogs, because I'm too fat to outrun them!\" Mark laughed, and said \"Don't worry. My dog's very well behaved -- and he's a purebred!\" Orville still had chunks of snow in his hair, but he tossed his head and looked strangely at the dog. \"Is that right?\" said Orville. \"My brother breeds dogs. He sells them to rich people who are looking for the purest breed of a dog. I bet your dog would be worth a lot of money!\" Mark laughed, but then realized that the mailman wasn't making a joke. \"My dog's not for sale!\" Mark said. Orville didn't say anything back. There was an awkward silence. Mark checked the ground for any more letters that their mailman had dropped, but Orville was already revving up the engine on his mail truck. Before Mark could say anything, Orville was already driving away down the road. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Back at the house, Mark told his father that he and Tina had seen been bear tracks in the snow. Mark's father looked worried, and his mother tried to change the subject. \"We need to take Macca to the vet soon for his annual check up!\" she said casually. But it didn't work. Mark was still worried about the bear. After dinner that night, Mark let Macca out into their back yard. \"I wouldn't sell you for a million dollars,\" he told his dog -- and Macca barked once, wagging his tail happily. The weather was unpredictable, and an inch of snow had already piled up on the tall fence that ran around their yard, so Mark was glad that Macca had a warm doghouse to sleep in. But that night, Mark had a nightmare. Macca was lost on their farm, and no matter how hard Mark looked, he couldn't find his beloved dog anywhere. Mark tried calling out for Macca in the night, but then he flopped down into a big drift of snow -- just like Orville their mailman had done that afternoon. In the dream, Mark's sister Taylor skipped up and stole all the mail out of Mark's hands. When Mark woke up that morning, he was in a frustrated mood. He leaped out of bed and went straight to the backyard to say hi to Macca. But Macca was gone. It had snowed in the night -- there were now two inches of snow along the fence around the yard. All sounds seemed to be muffled by the snow, filling the yard with a strange silence. An empty winter wind blew across the sunny sky. But there was no sign of Macca. \"Macca's missing!\" Mark said. \"Maybe a bear ate him,\" said Taylor. She was already awake, wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt that said, \"I WILL be seen and I WILL be heard.\" She'd come out of her room to see why Mark was upset. \"A bear did not eat my dog!\" Mark said angrily. But he ran out into the front yard to look for clues. All he saw was snow -- the driveway was completely covered with a smooth blanket, and it muffled all the sounds, making everything seem dangerously quiet. It was just like his nightmare last night... Suddenly Mark heard his dad's voice, shouting out from the house. \"It's too cold for you to be running around outside!\" \"But Dad!\" Mark shouted back. \"At least let me get your jackets out of your rooms.\" \"Dad!\" Mark said insistently. \"We need to talk to you!\" \"And I'm warm enough already,\" shouted Taylor. As they walked back to the house, Taylor asked \"Do you think mom just took Macca to the vet this morning?\" \"Or maybe Orville the mailman stole him,\" Mark said. \"He has a brother that sells dogs to rich people.\" But by the time they reached the house, Mark had suddenly put all the clues together. He turned to his father and said, \"Macca's gone from the back yard. And I know who's responsible!\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Mom; (b) Old Mugger; (c) Orville; (d) Taylor",
      "answer": "(d) Taylor",
      "outcome": "\"Orville the mailman has a brother that sells purebred dogs,\" Mark said. \"But I don't think he stole Macca. He's terrified of dogs!\"\n\"Because he's too fat to outrun them!\" said Taylor. \"I heard him talking to you last night.\"\nMark's dad laughed, and said \"Your mom wanted to take Macca to the vet -- but she didn't do that this morning.\"\n\"I know that,\" Mark replied. \"If she had, there'd be tire tracks down our driveway -- but instead, it's perfectly smooth.\"\nTaylor looked at Mark with wide eyes and asked, \"Was it Old Mugger the bear? Did he eat your dog?\"\n\"No!\" said Mark. \"Even if Mugger could climb over our fence, he would've knocked off some snow while he did. But there's still two inches of snow along the top of the fence, all the way around the yard.\" Taylor just sneezed, and her father said she needed her coat.\n\"That was the final clue,\" said Mark. \"Taylor has to be cold in that short-sleeved t-shirt. But for some reason she didn't want Dad going into her room.\"\n\"It was so cold yesterday,\" Taylor said, \"and I didn't want Macca to have to sleep outside.\" Last night she'd called Macca into her room, where he'd curled up on blanket and slept all night. \"And I just wanted to pretend that he was my dog -- just for one night.\"\nMark was touched by Taylor's obvious love for the dog. \"He's our dog,\" he said finally. \"And he's lucky to have a friend like you.\""
