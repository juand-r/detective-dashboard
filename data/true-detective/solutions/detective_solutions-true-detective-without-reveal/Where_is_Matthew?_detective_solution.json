    "full_text": "Five -year- old Andy, (5 1/2, as he would tell you), came to his father early one evening and said, “Matthew is hiding. Can you tell where he is Dad knew that the boys liked to play games with him and their mother. He also knew that Andy expected some questions. He started by asking, “I suppose you know where he is?” Andy, who expressed himself quite well for a five year old, replied, “Yes, I’ve been with him all afternoon. I know where he is but we want you to find him.” “OK. Tell me where you’ve been.” Andy started speaking hurriedly, causing Dad to have to remind him to slow down. Andy started again, forcing himself to speak more slowly. “Well, we’ve been in Matthew’s room, my room, the garage, the tree house and the hall closet.” Andy grinned, laughed, and said, “I bet you can’t find him!” Dad chuckled. This wouldn’t be too hard. At least, he did not think it would be. Three-year-old Matthew had an advanced way of losing things – and himself! Dad took a long look at his oldest son, as he often did. There were grass stains on his feet and the remnants of a chocolate bar around his lips. A typical five year old, he thought, before saying, “OK, but after we find him, you need a bath!” Almost shouting, Andy pleaded, “Tell me where he is!” Dad answered, “First, let’s takes a look around The first thing they inspected was the hall closet. The hall closet was right off of the entrance to the den. Dad had seen them open the closet door and shut it earlier in the afternoon before they headed upstairs. Next, they went upstairs to Andy’s room. There was a big water spill right at the entrance. Andy had brought an uncovered glass of water upstairs against his mother’s wishes earlier that morning and dropped it when opening the door to his room. Dad noticed with irritation the puddle was just as he had seen it several hours ago as nobody had bothered to wipe up the puddle. Andy was grinning and giggling. He was certain he and his little brother were putting one over on Dad. Dad said nothing but motioned for them to journey next to Matthew’s room. Matthew’s room was unusual. The closet was directly opposite the room entrance and had no door. The slide doors had been removed long ago and one could easily see everything in the closet. Looking over at Matthew’s crib bed, he realized he and Mom were going to have to get him a “big boy” bed soon. Mom was going to have to find another place to store the short pile of books, which were underneath the crib. Interestingly enough, the room had no other furniture. Dad and Mom could and, usually, did inventory everything in the room just by a quick scan from the hall when something of Matthew’s was missing, which was often. Next, Dad and Andy went outside to survey the tree house, which sat in the middle of the large back yard. Dad frowned as he remembered that Mom had chided him for watering the yard earlier. Now, he couldn’t mow until tomorrow. He looked down and saw his shoes were damp from the still wet grass. He silently berated himself for wearing his new house shoes outside. He could already see a green tinge on one of them. Finally, they went to the garage, departing through the kitchen. Andy was a little hesitant to go there. He knew Dad and Mom got mad if he or Matthew went to the garage without one of them, although that did not stop either of them from doing it occasionally. Not only did Dad have a room full of tools and chemicals that were not kid friendly, but the garage floor had many years of grime on it. Invariably, when Matthew or Andy would venture there alone, they would track oily grime onto the kitchen floor upon returning back into the house. Dad looked around for a moment and said, “OK, Andy, let’s go back into the house.” Back in the den, Andy became excited again, asking, “Where is he, where is he?” Dad grinned and said, gently, “I know where he is. Let’s go get him.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Clarify the “mystery”.  No one has been murdered or robbed; what Dad has to solve is where the missing little boy (Matthew) is hiding.  The “culprit”, therefore, is simply the person who is concealing himself.\n\n2. List every place Andy said the boys had been:  \n   • Matthew’s room • Andy’s room • Garage • Tree-house • Hall closet  \n\n3. Compare each statement with the physical evidence Dad notices while he and Andy make their tour.  \n\n   A. Andy’s room – The big puddle Andy made that morning is still exactly as it was.  \n      If the boys had “been in Andy’s room all afternoon” the puddle would have been\n      smeared, stepped in, or mopped up.  No footprints, no splashes = nobody has gone\n      through that doorway since the morning.  Andy’s claim is false.  \n\n   B. Garage –  The kitchen floor is spotless: no black, oily tracks, no grime.  \n      Whenever either boy really goes into the garage, they invariably track filth\n      back across the kitchen tiles.  Therefore the boys have not been in the garage\n      either.  Another false claim.  \n\n   C. Tree-house – To reach it one must cross the still-wet, newly watered lawn.  \n      Dad’s slippers get wet green streaks in the short walk; Andy’s bare feet,\n      inspected before they went outside, were only grass-stained but perfectly dry.  \n      So the boys did not cross that wet grass earlier in the afternoon.  \n      Another part of Andy’s story that cannot be true.  \n\n   D. Matthew’s room – From the doorway Dad can see the whole room, the open closet,\n      and even the books under the crib; Matthew obviously isn’t there.  \n\n   E. Hall closet – This is the only place where (i) Dad actually saw the boys fooling\n      with the door earlier in the day, and (ii) none of the physical evidence rules\n      out their presence.  When Dad and Andy “inspected” it the first time, Dad just\n      glanced in; he never shoved the coats aside or looked behind them.  A three-\n      year-old could stand on the boot box at the back and be completely hidden by the\n      hanging coats.  \n\n4. Conclusion: the four other locations are disproved by positive physical evidence;\n   the hall closet is the sole remaining possibility.  Therefore Matthew must still\n   be inside the hall closet, tucked behind the coats, exactly where Dad saw the boys\n   playing with the door earlier.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAndy (Andrew), Matthew, Dad, Mom\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMatthew\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly in the afternoon the two boys decided to play a trick on Dad.  \nThey opened the hall-closet door; Matthew stepped in and climbed onto the boot\nbox behind the coats; Andy shut the door.  \nAndy then ran off and invented an impressive list of places they had supposedly\nvisited, hoping to send Dad on a wild-goose chase.  \nBecause no one has entered Andy’s room since the morning\n(the water puddle is untouched), because the kitchen floor is still clean\n(the garage story is false), and because crossing the wet lawn would have left\nAndy’s feet wet and green (the tree-house story is also false), Dad is able to\nrule out every other hiding place.  \nThe only plausible spot left—the one place Dad actually saw the boys fooling\nwith and the only place not eliminated by evidence—is the hall closet.\nAfter the tour Dad returns to the den, tells Andy he has solved the puzzle,\nwalks back to the closet, parts the coats, and lifts a giggling Matthew down.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMom – Nowhere near the game; no opportunity or involvement.  \nDad – Investigator only.  \nAndy – He was an accomplice in the prank but not the one who was “lost”.  \nOnly Matthew is literally responsible for the “disappearance”, so only he can\nbe called the culprit of this very gentle crime.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
