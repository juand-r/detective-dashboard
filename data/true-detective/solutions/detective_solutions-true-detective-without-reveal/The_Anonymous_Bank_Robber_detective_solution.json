    "full_text": "Somewhere in the United States heartland, there were five elderly men gathered around the Lierman fireplace on a cold evening in January. Lester Barton, Larry Brooks, Edward Cantrell, Oscar Jordan and Patrick Lierman, all over the age of 80, had been friends since World War II. They were all widowers, Oscar’s wife being the last spouse to pass away late last year. Recently, Patrick learned something about a friend in the group -- one of the old men had been a bank robber in the 1930s. He had spent time in a federal penitentiary. Patrick learned of this from an anonymous letter sent to him by the guilty party. In the letter, the friend detailed his life of crime in the desperate days of the dust bowl and depression era, emphasizing that nobody had ever been harmed during the course of his criminal activities. The letter writer insisted that he wouldn’t have committed such crimes under normal circumstances, but his family had been suffering from extreme deprivation and starvation on the meager family farm. He had no choice. The writer offered, “Life was very grim. All of our cattle and horses died of exposure and disease, and crops were scarce during the dust bowl years.” He also wrote that, although he had served prison time, he still felt guilt and remorse over his actions. Thus, he wanted to come clean with his oldest and closest friends. “But first,” he had written, “let’s gather and see if you and our friends can figure out who wrote this letter. Guys our age can use the mental exercise.” So, it was with no small degree of anticipation and excitement that Patrick welcomed the group into his home on a cold January evening. After serving warm apple cider and brandy to his guests, he read them the letter. Then, giving them time to digest the information he stated, simply, “So, one of us is a convicted bank robber. We are to figure out who he is. May we all agree that all questions will be answered truthfully?” There were affirmative replies and nods all around. Patrick, a retired trial lawyer, nodded also and said, “Good, let’s begin. This is going to be interesting.” Patrick had had time to decide how he would question each of his friends. He started by asking Larry Brooks, “Explain to me why you are not the bank robber?” Larry, a retired missionary, said, “In the 1930s our family was in Mexico.” Everyone in the room knew that the Brooks family had a long and impressive history helping the poor in Juarez. Patrick nodded and continued, asking Lester Barton, “So, tell us about your early life, Lester.” Lester, a retired dry goods wholesaler who still maintained a couple of old crony accounts, grimaced and replied, “Life was tough for our family. Dad couldn’t get work at home, so the family packed up and headed south. Dad worked whatever jobs he could get. One distinct memory I have is from 1938. We were in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Dad drove a horse drawn milk and ice wagon, working from before sunrise until after sundown. I remember the night he was still out and the Orson Welles radio show “War of the Worlds” came on. Most of the time I was with him helping with the wagon and deliveries, but not on this night. People all over the country were panicking because everyone thought we were being attacked by martians. I was afraid Dad had heard it and gotten scared.” Patrick cocked an eyebrow and asked, “Do you recall the date of the Welles broadcast?” “Yes. I remember it very well. It was October 30, 1938.” Patrick was satisfied with this answer and turned to Oscar Jordan. He wished to be easier on Oscar, because of the recent death of his wife, but they had to know if he was the one who wrote the letter. Gently, he asked Oscar, “What were the depression years like for you, Oscar?” “Not too good,” he answered, dryly. “During my senior year of high school, I was laid up in bed with tuberculosis. A few months after that, I contracted polio.” Oscar shuddered, “It took me a long time to learn to walk again, and my hand and arm muscles were weak for many years. Today, you would call what I did to recover as ‘extensive rehab.’” Patrick studied him thoughtfully for a long moment before moving to the last person in the group, Edward Cantrell. Edward, a retired US Army colonel, was the oldest in the group. At age 95, he had been in his early thirties during the war. Patrick asked him, “What do you know of the mounted infantry?” Edward was surprised by this question, but answered, “A little bit. There were still a few horse cavalry troops around in the 1930s and 40s … but only a few.” “Can you ride a horse?” Patrick asked. Still puzzled, Edward answered, “Yes.” Patrick then asked, “What branch of the US Army were you in? “Armor. I was a tank officer.” Proudly, he offered, “I knew Patton.” Patrick smiled at him and announced to the group, “… and I know who our bank robber is.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  The letter says the robber acted only because his family’s farm was ruined during the Dust-Bowl years – a motive that fits someone who was already an adult in the early 1930s and would have felt responsible for feeding a family.  \n2.  Opportunity (age, place and physical capacity in the 1930s)  \n   •  Edward Cantrell – 95 now → born about 1915 → 18-25 during the Depression – old enough to rob banks.  \n   •  Larry Brooks – 82-83 now → only 6-12 in the early 1930s and claims his missionary family was in Mexico.  \n   •  Lester Barton – about 82-83 now → was 11-12 in 1933; in 1938 he was still delivering milk with his father.  \n   •  Oscar Jordan – same age range as Lester but bedridden with tuberculosis his senior year and struck by polio immediately afterward – he could hardly walk, let alone hold a gun.  \n   •  Patrick Lierman – the recipient, not a suspect.  \n3.  Physical evidence / alibis drawn from their answers  \n   •  Larry’s “We were in Mexico” places him outside the USA, and everyone present knows that missionary history.  \n   •  Lester’s vivid memory of the 1938 “War of the Worlds” broadcast shows he was a child helping his father – not a fugitive bank robber.  \n   •  Oscar’s illness is a solid physical alibi.  \n   •  Edward alone had no disqualifying alibi. He confirmed he could ride horses – a natural skill for a farm boy even though, as the letter states, the family’s own animals had died.  \n4.  Logical deduction  \n   •  If you remove every man who, by age, location or health, could not possibly have robbed banks in the early 1930s, only one name remains: Edward Cantrell.  \n   •  Patrick’s last questions (about mounted infantry, horse riding and branch of service) were designed to check whether Cantrell possessed the right background for someone who grew up on a farm before entering the army. He did.  \n   •  Patrick therefore announced the solution immediately after Cantrell’s answers.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPatrick Lierman, Larry Brooks, Lester Barton, Oscar Jordan, Edward Cantrell\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nEdward Cantrell\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEdward Cantrell was born on a small Mid-western farm. When the Dust Bowl struck, drought and disease killed the family’s livestock and ruined their crops. Desperate to support his parents and siblings, Edward drifted into a short-lived career of non-violent bank robberies between 1932 and 1935. He was eventually arrested by federal agents and served time in a federal penitentiary.\n\nReleased before World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, where wartime manpower needs and his clean disciplinary record after release allowed him to rise through the ranks, eventually becoming an armor officer and later a colonel. He never told his wartime buddies of his youthful crimes.\n\nIn old age the guilt still bothered him, especially after the death of Oscar’s wife reminded him of life’s brevity. Wanting to come clean, he wrote an anonymous letter to Patrick Lierman challenging the group to discover his identity. Patrick’s methodical questioning eliminated every man except Edward, whose age, background and lack of any disqualifying alibi matched the facts in the letter. Thus Patrick named him the former bank robber.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Patrick Lierman – received the letter; obviously not the writer.  \n•  Larry Brooks – Too young to rob banks in the early 1930s and lived in Mexico then; therefore lacked both age and opportunity.  \n•  Lester Barton – Only a boy during the Depression; his detailed 1938 memory places him at his father’s side, not in prison.  \n•  Oscar Jordan – Spent his late teens and early twenties fighting tuberculosis and polio; physically incapable of armed robbery.  \nOnly Edward Cantrell meets every requirement stated in the anonymous confession.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
