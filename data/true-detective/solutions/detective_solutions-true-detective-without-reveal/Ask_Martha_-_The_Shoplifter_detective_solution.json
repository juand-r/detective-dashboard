    "full_text": "Crusher Davis finished his milkshake in one long slurping gulp. Since at 6 foot 6 and 265 pounds he was still growing, he had taken the habit of leaving the Chronicle office for his morning snack at the Temptee Diner. Sometimes, he thought, these milkshakes were the highight of the whole morning. But that was not the case this morning. For he had received a number of emails to his Ask Martha personal column in the newspaper. He was getting something of a fan club, it seemed. Or rather, Martha was. The readers liked interaction, he had found. So he didn’t just wait for inquiries to come to him, people asking for advice. Sometimes he wrote a column in which asked a question, and his readers would unburden themselves to his email address. That’s what he had done on Tuesday, and now on Thursday morning, there was a series of replies. He had just said, in his column, that everyone has faults, and we all have to deal with that. Maybe the experiences of some readers who have wrestled with a personal problem would help others who were now also going through a difficult time. Just tell your story, and what you did about it or didn’t do, and that experience plus Martha’s comment might help other readers in the same fix. The first email was from Jimmy Bean. Crusher knew that the names given him in these emails were not real. That was all right with him. He also disguised in his column what he was told somewhat, in order not to embarrass people. That was just playing the game. The important thing was the advice and helping people. Well, Jimmy’s girlfriend had returned a present that he had bought at Craft’s Jewelry Store for her birthday. It was a nice broach, the first jewelry he had ever bought, and it had cost him $20 on sale. Jimmy was really upset. The broach that she had worn at their last date was a swan, actually very nice. Jimmy had seen it at the same jewelry store and decided not to buy it. He remembered it had cost $40 when he had gone birthday shopping for her. He asked her what had happened and she got all red and then admitted that she had returned the other broach and gotten a credit for it, which really was almost as good as Jimmy buying this one in the first place. She even showed him the receipt. “My foot!” Davis said. “That’s so inconsiderate. If he sticks with her, some divorce lawyer is going to collect some serious money in not too many years, that’s for sure.” He made some notes for his column and then turned to the second email. This was from Linda, and she had a different problem. Her boyfriend forgot about her birthday entirely. He had made it worse by pretending that he had remembered it all the time. They had met for lunch and she was not a happy camper. He figured out why she was sad before she blurted it out, Linda gave him that. He then gave her this big line that she wanted to believe about his leaving her present on the counter of Mason’s Department Store. Just excuse him for a minute or two, and he’d make matters right. He could certainly talk nicely when he wanted to, Linda wrote, which was usually when he was in trouble. Maybe he was good at sweet-talking because he so often needed to be! Anyway, it wasn’t ten minutes before he returned with a package in a bag from Mason’s Department Store. And inside the bag was a very nice bathing suit - the wrong size! Crusher Davis grinned. “He’s hopeless, that’s for sure. She’ll have some hard times with him. But maybe it’ll be worth it in the long run. He did after all try to correct his blunder, even if he told her a white lie while doing so.” The third email was from a fellow named Walt that Davis was sure he knew, since he wrote that he worked as a ticket seller at the Acme Movie Complex. It seems that when Walt came on duty, after the bargain late afternoon movie, he had found a bag in the ticket seller’s booth. He asked Sam, ticket seller at the bargain movie, about it. One of Sam’s duties was to clean up the theater after each performance, a chore Sam hated. You were always getting a handful of used chewing gum, for one thing. Sam told him that a pretty girl he knew only slightly from high school had been so caught up in the movie that when she left the theater, she had left a paper bag on her seat. Sam had put it in the booth for safekeeping while he cleaned up the theater. Well, Walt wrote that the bag contained eight DVDs - they were unmarked, but probably came from the Jones Movie Rental Shop, since it was the only one in town. He didn’t know if they had been stolen or not, and he didn’t want to get this girl into trouble. Neither did he want to help a thief. What should he do? “Well, Sam, you’re probably the one in trouble now,” Davis thought. ”You should have returned them to her immediately. That is, if you saw her with the package when she came into the theater. Or if you weren’t sure, you should have returned them to the Jones Movie Rental Ship and let them handle it. Be decisive, man!” The fourth email was from Lester, and he also had problems. His girlfriend was color-blind and wouldn’t admit it. Not that there was anything wrong in that, but she had gotten him a sweater that was the most awful shade of deep orange he had ever seen. She liked it and said that the salesgirl had assured her that the present would make a big hit. But Lester hated it. He could just imagine the kidding the other guys were going to give him when he wore the sweater, if he had to do so. She said she had thrown away the receipt. Lester thought she said this because she clearly didn’t want him to return the sweater. What did Martha think - could he return it? “Well, you either turn in the girl friend or the sweater, my friend,” Davis thought. Then he began to think harder about the problems. Who was really involved here? It was a small town, and he knew everybody. Part time coaching at Centerville High made that a sure thing. Let’s take stock. Well, for one thing, there was only one color-blind girl at Centerville High, and that was Martha Hampden. The smooth talker that Linda was dating had to be Steve Kravitz. Jimmy Bean was writing about Jane Croydon, for sure. She was always looking over her shoulder for a better date. He could just picture her at the jewelry store swapping the broach. He thought of Walt’s email. Davis couldn’t imagine whom Sam had in mind, the girl at the movie. But Sam was Johnny Martin. He was a loner, hard to approach. In fact, Davis had been at the bargain late afternoon movie, which was very lightly attended and had seen him on duty. In fact, Johnny Martin had sold him his ticket. Davis was jotting a few notes when his friend Inspector Samuels came into the Tastee Diner. “Thought I’d see you here, Crusher. I wonder if you could give me a hand with this problem of shoplifting. There’s been a regular outbreak recently, and I spent most of the morning talking with businessmen on Main Street. Also it’s quite touchy, since nobody wants to make a false accusation, and ruin some youngster’s reputation.” “Sure, Inspector. What do they tell you?” “Well, at Craft’s Jewelry Store, they are missing a nice broach, that had been on sale. The last sales records show that Jane Croydon had brought in a broach last week, a different one, but they remember that she had looked closely at the missing one. It just seemed suspicious at the time. The trouble was that the sales clerk is new and doesn’t always get the sales receipts done properly. “Then at Mason’s Department Store, there has been a problem with their on sale counter. It is close to the door, and not all of those for sale items have security tags on them - you know, those devices that go off whenever someone tries to sneak an item out the front door. The routine is for customers to take their items across the aisle, where a clerk will bag the purchase and write up the sale. But that doesn’t always happen as it should. “And over at the Jones Movie Rental Shop, some employee has been ripping off the company, stealing DVDs and removing the sleeve identification that shows where they come from. They are pretty sure whom it is, but they don’t know who has been taking the DVDs out of the store. “All that sounds like quite a crime wave for Centerville, Inspector. But I can tell you one thing. Once I tell you what I’ve learned as Ask Martha, one shoplifting at least will be solved.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What is missing?  \n   •  Craft’s Jewelry Store – an inexpensive brooch that had been on sale.  \n   •  Mason’s Department Store – small sale-counter articles are disappearing from the table that stands right by the front door; the shop can’t tell who takes them because customers are supposed to carry them across the aisle to a clerk to be wrapped and rung up.  \n   •  Jones Movie Rental Shop – DVDs are disappearing after an employee removes the identifying sleeves; the shop thinks it knows the employee but not the person who actually carries the discs out of the store.\n\n2.  Which one of these three thefts can Crusher Davis clear up from the four e-mails he has just read?  \n   •  E-mail #1 (Jimmy Bean) shows that Jane Croydon returned the brooch Jimmy bought her and openly received store credit.  Nothing in the letter shows Jane in possession of a brooch she did not pay for; there is no proof she stole the missing one.  The letter gives no clear solution to the Jewelry-Store loss.  \n   •  E-mail #3 (Walt) shows that a high-school girl left a paper bag containing eight un-sleeved DVDs in the cinema.  Walt does not know whose bag it is, and neither does Crusher.  That e-mail is not enough for Crusher to name the DVD thief.  \n   •  E-mail #2 (Linda) is very different.  Her boyfriend, the smooth-talking Steve Kravitz, had forgotten her birthday.  When Linda confronted him at lunch he pretended he already had a gift and had merely “left it on the counter at Mason’s Department Store.”  He hurried off – and less than ten minutes later was back with a Mason’s bag containing a bathing-suit … the wrong size, naturally with no sales slip.  \n        –  The bathing-suit came from the sale table that sits right by Mason’s front door – exactly the counter the Inspector tells us is losing merchandise.  \n        –  Ten minutes is far too short a time to run back to the store, find the right clerk, have the clerk look up a “forgotten purchase,” and get the parcel re-wrapped.  It is, however, plenty of time to dart into the store, snatch an item from the sale table (no security tags) and slip it into one of the store’s printed bags that lie on the nearby wrapping counter.  \n        –  Steve’s motive is painfully clear: he needed something – anything – to hand to Linda so she would think he had remembered her birthday.  \n   Therefore the e-mail about Linda and Steve gives Crusher a complete, logical explanation for one of the thefts the Inspector is investigating – the shoplifting at Mason’s.\n\n3.  Conclusion: the only crime that is solved by the Ask-Martha letters is the one at Mason’s, and the only person who had both motive and opportunity, and whose actions match the store’s losses, is Steve Kravitz.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJane Croydon, Steve Kravitz, Johnny Martin (Sam), unnamed high-school girl with the DVDs\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nSteve Kravitz\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOn Linda’s birthday Steve Kravitz forgot to buy her a present.  When Linda’s disappointment gave away his blunder, Steve ad-libbed a story that he had already bought her gift and had merely left it “on the counter at Mason’s Department Store.”  He rushed to Mason’s, grabbed a bathing-suit from the on-sale table that stands beside the front door (these items carry no security tags and a customer is supposed to present them across the aisle for ringing-up).  Without stopping at a cash register he picked up an empty Mason’s shopping bag from the unattended wrapping counter, stuffed the bathing-suit into it, and walked straight out—shoplifting the suit.  Less than ten minutes after leaving Linda he was back, proudly handing her the stolen parcel.  Because he had grabbed whatever was on top of the pile, the suit was not even her size.  His quick “miracle” gift is the very theft Mason’s has been puzzling over.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Jane Croydon did return a brooch, but she did it openly and received a credit slip; there is no evidence she ever possessed the costlier brooch that the jewelry store is missing.  \n•  Johnny Martin (Sam) merely stored a lost bag in the ticket booth.  The e-mail gives no indication he stole the DVDs, and the rental shop believes the discs are disappearing before they ever reach the cinema.  \n•  The unknown high-school girl obviously had the DVDs, but without knowing whether she received them innocently from the dishonest rental-store employee, Crusher cannot accuse her.  \nOnly Steve Kravitz’s actions line up perfectly with one of the reported shopliftings, so he—and he alone—is the culprit Crusher can identify for Inspector Samuels. </WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "correct_answer": "(b) Johnny Martin",
    "reveal_text": "Jane Croydon may have personality issues, but she is no thief. She had the receipt for her purchase of the broach, which would have showed a credit for the earlier, returned item. Steve Kravitz remembers things at the last minute, but he is also honest. He didn’t give the receipt to his girlfriend because the gift was a birthday present. The fact that it was in a Mason’s Department Store bag meant that he had to go to the counter with his purchase, to get the bag. Martha Hampden didn’t have a receipt for her purchase of the orange sweater, but the fact that she discussed it with a sales clerk can be easily verified.\nThat leaves Johnny Martin and the package of eight DVDs. That is a very large number of DVDs for a customer to check out at once. The fact that the store identification has been removed is also suspicious. Davis would probably have noticed a pretty girl sitting by herself in the last row of a lightly attended late afternoon movie. It sounds like “Sam’s” story is made up. It made his coworker Walt suspicious and Crusher Davis even more suspicious.",

      "mystery_text": "Crusher Davis finished his milkshake in one long slurping gulp. Since at 6 foot 6 and 265 pounds he was still growing, he had taken the habit of leaving the Chronicle office for his morning snack at the Temptee Diner. Sometimes, he thought, these milkshakes were the highight of the whole morning. But that was not the case this morning. For he had received a number of emails to his Ask Martha personal column in the newspaper. He was getting something of a fan club, it seemed. Or rather, Martha was. The readers liked interaction, he had found. So he didn’t just wait for inquiries to come to him, people asking for advice. Sometimes he wrote a column in which asked a question, and his readers would unburden themselves to his email address. That’s what he had done on Tuesday, and now on Thursday morning, there was a series of replies. He had just said, in his column, that everyone has faults, and we all have to deal with that. Maybe the experiences of some readers who have wrestled with a personal problem would help others who were now also going through a difficult time. Just tell your story, and what you did about it or didn’t do, and that experience plus Martha’s comment might help other readers in the same fix. The first email was from Jimmy Bean. Crusher knew that the names given him in these emails were not real. That was all right with him. He also disguised in his column what he was told somewhat, in order not to embarrass people. That was just playing the game. The important thing was the advice and helping people. Well, Jimmy’s girlfriend had returned a present that he had bought at Craft’s Jewelry Store for her birthday. It was a nice broach, the first jewelry he had ever bought, and it had cost him $20 on sale. Jimmy was really upset. The broach that she had worn at their last date was a swan, actually very nice. Jimmy had seen it at the same jewelry store and decided not to buy it. He remembered it had cost $40 when he had gone birthday shopping for her. He asked her what had happened and she got all red and then admitted that she had returned the other broach and gotten a credit for it, which really was almost as good as Jimmy buying this one in the first place. She even showed him the receipt. “My foot!” Davis said. “That’s so inconsiderate. If he sticks with her, some divorce lawyer is going to collect some serious money in not too many years, that’s for sure.” He made some notes for his column and then turned to the second email. This was from Linda, and she had a different problem. Her boyfriend forgot about her birthday entirely. He had made it worse by pretending that he had remembered it all the time. They had met for lunch and she was not a happy camper. He figured out why she was sad before she blurted it out, Linda gave him that. He then gave her this big line that she wanted to believe about his leaving her present on the counter of Mason’s Department Store. Just excuse him for a minute or two, and he’d make matters right. He could certainly talk nicely when he wanted to, Linda wrote, which was usually when he was in trouble. Maybe he was good at sweet-talking because he so often needed to be! Anyway, it wasn’t ten minutes before he returned with a package in a bag from Mason’s Department Store. And inside the bag was a very nice bathing suit - the wrong size! Crusher Davis grinned. “He’s hopeless, that’s for sure. She’ll have some hard times with him. But maybe it’ll be worth it in the long run. He did after all try to correct his blunder, even if he told her a white lie while doing so.” The third email was from a fellow named Walt that Davis was sure he knew, since he wrote that he worked as a ticket seller at the Acme Movie Complex. It seems that when Walt came on duty, after the bargain late afternoon movie, he had found a bag in the ticket seller’s booth. He asked Sam, ticket seller at the bargain movie, about it. One of Sam’s duties was to clean up the theater after each performance, a chore Sam hated. You were always getting a handful of used chewing gum, for one thing. Sam told him that a pretty girl he knew only slightly from high school had been so caught up in the movie that when she left the theater, she had left a paper bag on her seat. Sam had put it in the booth for safekeeping while he cleaned up the theater. Well, Walt wrote that the bag contained eight DVDs - they were unmarked, but probably came from the Jones Movie Rental Shop, since it was the only one in town. He didn’t know if they had been stolen or not, and he didn’t want to get this girl into trouble. Neither did he want to help a thief. What should he do? “Well, Sam, you’re probably the one in trouble now,” Davis thought. ”You should have returned them to her immediately. That is, if you saw her with the package when she came into the theater. Or if you weren’t sure, you should have returned them to the Jones Movie Rental Ship and let them handle it. Be decisive, man!” The fourth email was from Lester, and he also had problems. His girlfriend was color-blind and wouldn’t admit it. Not that there was anything wrong in that, but she had gotten him a sweater that was the most awful shade of deep orange he had ever seen. She liked it and said that the salesgirl had assured her that the present would make a big hit. But Lester hated it. He could just imagine the kidding the other guys were going to give him when he wore the sweater, if he had to do so. She said she had thrown away the receipt. Lester thought she said this because she clearly didn’t want him to return the sweater. What did Martha think - could he return it? “Well, you either turn in the girl friend or the sweater, my friend,” Davis thought. Then he began to think harder about the problems. Who was really involved here? It was a small town, and he knew everybody. Part time coaching at Centerville High made that a sure thing. Let’s take stock. Well, for one thing, there was only one color-blind girl at Centerville High, and that was Martha Hampden. The smooth talker that Linda was dating had to be Steve Kravitz. Jimmy Bean was writing about Jane Croydon, for sure. She was always looking over her shoulder for a better date. He could just picture her at the jewelry store swapping the broach. He thought of Walt’s email. Davis couldn’t imagine whom Sam had in mind, the girl at the movie. But Sam was Johnny Martin. He was a loner, hard to approach. In fact, Davis had been at the bargain late afternoon movie, which was very lightly attended and had seen him on duty. In fact, Johnny Martin had sold him his ticket. Davis was jotting a few notes when his friend Inspector Samuels came into the Tastee Diner. “Thought I’d see you here, Crusher. I wonder if you could give me a hand with this problem of shoplifting. There’s been a regular outbreak recently, and I spent most of the morning talking with businessmen on Main Street. Also it’s quite touchy, since nobody wants to make a false accusation, and ruin some youngster’s reputation.” “Sure, Inspector. What do they tell you?” “Well, at Craft’s Jewelry Store, they are missing a nice broach, that had been on sale. The last sales records show that Jane Croydon had brought in a broach last week, a different one, but they remember that she had looked closely at the missing one. It just seemed suspicious at the time. The trouble was that the sales clerk is new and doesn’t always get the sales receipts done properly. “Then at Mason’s Department Store, there has been a problem with their on sale counter. It is close to the door, and not all of those for sale items have security tags on them - you know, those devices that go off whenever someone tries to sneak an item out the front door. The routine is for customers to take their items across the aisle, where a clerk will bag the purchase and write up the sale. But that doesn’t always happen as it should. “And over at the Jones Movie Rental Shop, some employee has been ripping off the company, stealing DVDs and removing the sleeve identification that shows where they come from. They are pretty sure whom it is, but they don’t know who has been taking the DVDs out of the store. “All that sounds like quite a crime wave for Centerville, Inspector. But I can tell you one thing. Once I tell you what I’ve learned as Ask Martha, one shoplifting at least will be solved.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Jane Croydon; (b) Johnny Martin; (c) Martha Hampden; (d) Steve Kravitz",
      "answer": "(b) Johnny Martin",
      "outcome": "Jane Croydon may have personality issues, but she is no thief. She had the receipt for her purchase of the broach, which would have showed a credit for the earlier, returned item. Steve Kravitz remembers things at the last minute, but he is also honest. He didn’t give the receipt to his girlfriend because the gift was a birthday present. The fact that it was in a Mason’s Department Store bag meant that he had to go to the counter with his purchase, to get the bag. Martha Hampden didn’t have a receipt for her purchase of the orange sweater, but the fact that she discussed it with a sales clerk can be easily verified.\nThat leaves Johnny Martin and the package of eight DVDs. That is a very large number of DVDs for a customer to check out at once. The fact that the store identification has been removed is also suspicious. Davis would probably have noticed a pretty girl sitting by herself in the last row of a lightly attended late afternoon movie. It sounds like “Sam’s” story is made up. It made his coworker Walt suspicious and Crusher Davis even more suspicious."
