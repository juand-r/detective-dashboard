    "full_text": "Mashed potatoes. Stuffing. Gravy. Pumpkin pie. We had all of the ingredients for a perfect Thanksgiving. Except, we were missing the main course — a turkey. \"I saw it flying high up in the sky,\" joked my little sister, Tina. Earlier that morning, my father began preparing the turkey (before it had, according to Tina, jumped off the platter, walked out the front door and flown away). My father is a good cook (my mother, however, is a great cook). This year, my father was in charge of the turkey. Sure, we were all a bit worried about how our meal might turn out, but we felt reassured when my mother helped in the kitchen by fixing the stuffing and mashed potatoes. Uncle Larry was excited about the dinner — but maybe a little too excited. He hovered over my father in the kitchen, \"You should soak the turkey in salt water,\" he insisted. \"It'll make the turkey taste better, and you won't have to add any salt later!\" “Don’t worry, Larry, I know what I’m doing … I think” my father replied, chuckling. \"I’m tellin’ you, salt water will make the turkey cook faster,\" Uncle Larry continued. \"If you cook the turkey the slow way, you're likely to burn the house down!\" “Don’t worry, buddy, I won’t be burning anything today — the house, or the turkey for that matter,” he said, grinning. “I plan to monitor this bird when it’s in the oven, basting it every few minutes, and checking that its skin is more golden than your Florida tan!” Mom stepped in, “Larry, the turkey would have to soak in the salt water for at least 12 hours to absorb enough salt,” and Uncle Larry, feeling defeated, agreed. While Uncle Larry was overexcited about our dinner, there was one person who was indifferent this Thanksgiving: My older brother, Greg. He’d been away all year at college, and had come home for the weekend to visit us for Thanksgiving. Greg had wanted to watch his college's football team play in a big game. Unfortunately, Thanksgiving dinner would be ready right at 3:00 p.m., and that meant Greg would have to miss the end of the game. To counteract Greg’s lack of interest, there was someone else who was eager about our turkey dinner — our dog, Darby. He smelled the raw turkey meat, wagged his tail, and attempted to jump on the counter for a closer look! But no one would want to eat the turkey if Darby had licked it or stolen a bite, so Tina and I grabbed Darby's collar and took him out for a walk. When we got back, we brought Darby to the backyard. We put Darby on his chain, and then went back inside the house to smell the turkey still cooking in the oven. Greg was in the living room watching the beginning of the big football game. Uncle Larry was in there too, reminding Greg that he wouldn't get to see the end of the game. Suddenly my father realized he'd forgotten something — cranberry sauce for the turkey! He popped into the TV room to tell everyone that he was rushing off to the store. Tina and I went into the backyard to check on Darby. It was only a few minutes later when we looked into the empty oven; the turkey had mysteriously vanished! There was a trail of juice that had dripped from the turkey, stopping halfway across the kitchen, right in front of the refrigerator. \"It looks like someone mopped up the trail of juice to cover their tracks,\" Tina said. \"I bet Greg grabbed the turkey,\" I told Tina. Tina squinted and curled her little lips, sneering. Sometimes our older brother would tease her, so Tina was always suspicious of him. \"Maybe he hid the turkey so that dinner would have to start later. That way, he could watch his football game!\" We went to talk to Greg, but he had — like the turkey — mysteriously disappeared. \"We won't be able to ask him any questions until we find him!\" I said. \"Let's keep looking for the turkey.\" We looked in Greg's room, and mom and dad’s room, and even in the bathroom! We looked all around the house, and found nothing. \"There's someone else who wanted the turkey,\" I said. \"Darby!” Just then, we heard Uncle Larry walk into the living room. He was in a good mood, singing a song to himself. \"Uncle Larry sure seems happy,\" Tina said. \"I wonder if Uncle Larry stole the turkey?\" I whispered to Tina. \"Maybe he stole the turkey to soak it in a tub of salt water!\" she suggested. We looked at each other, wondering if it could be true. But before we could finish our investigation, our father burst through the door. \"Let the magic begin!\" he said, holding up a big can of cranberry sauce. My mother kissed him as he came through the door. He seemed cheerful as he headed toward the kitchen. We were surprised to see Greg coming back from the car. “When I told Greg we were out of cranberry sauce, he decided to come to the store with me.” My father put his arm around Greg and gave him a friendly squeeze, which made our brother smile and blush. I was about to disrupt his happy mood, and reveal to my father that the turkey was missing — when Tina tugged at my shirt, and whispered up at me, \"I know where the turkey is.\" \"What?\" I said. \"I put all of the clues together — it didn’t fly away. I know exactly where it is, and who put it there.”",

Answer in the form:\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n<name(s) here>\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n<name(s) here>\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\nNow write down your reconstruction of the events of what actually happened.\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n<event reconstruction here>\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\nFinally, explain why the other suspects are innocent.\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n<explanation here>\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the time-line  \n   • Morning – Dad is basting the turkey; Mom is finishing the side dishes.  \n   • Early afternoon – Everyone is in (or near) the TV room; the bird is still in the oven.  \n   • Dad suddenly remembers the cranberry sauce, announces he is “rushing off to the store.”  \n   • Tina and I take the dog outside and chain him in the back yard.  \n   • When we return (only a few minutes later) we open the oven – the turkey has vanished.  \n   • A short, half-cleaned drip-trail of turkey juice ends in front of the refrigerator.  \n   • Greg is nowhere in the house.  \n   • Uncle Larry strolls into the living room, humming.  \n   • A little later Dad comes back in with cranberry sauce, and Greg walks in from the car; Dad says Greg decided to ride along.\n\n2. Physical evidence  \n   • The drip-trail stops at the refrigerator → the turkey’s destination must be inside it.  \n   • Part of the trail has been hastily wiped up → the thief had only seconds to “cover his tracks.”  \n   • A dog cannot open a refrigerator or wield a mop; the children were outside; Dad and Greg left only moments before; Mom was still in the house; Uncle Larry never left the TV room until after the bird was gone.\n\n3. Motive analysis  \n   • Greg – strong motive: he openly complains he will miss the end of his college football game because dinner is scheduled for 3 p.m.  If the turkey “disappears,” dinner is necessarily delayed and he can watch the whole game.  \n   • Uncle Larry – weak motive: wants the bird soaked in salt water, but brining after cooking is useless.  \n   • Mom – no reason to sabotage dinner she herself helped prepare.  \n   • Dad – no reason; he was proud of “babysitting” the bird.  \n   • Dog – no ability.  \n   • Children – they found the bird missing.\n\n4. Opportunity  \n   • The only person who is missing from the house at the exact moment the bird disappears is Greg – he slipped out to “go to the store” with Dad.  He had a short window (after Dad’s announcement and before he ran to catch up with Dad) to yank the roasting pan from the oven, drag/slide it to the refrigerator, shove it inside, hastily wipe half the trail, then dash to the car.  \n   • Mom was presumably still in the kitchen area.  If she had pulled out a hot turkey and jammed it in the fridge she would have mentioned it (and she certainly would have put it on the counter to rest, not in a refrigerator).  \n   • Uncle Larry was visible in the TV room right up to Dad’s announcement and again shortly after the disappearance.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n   – The half-wiped trail shows the culprit was in a hurry.  \n   – The bird ended up in the refrigerator; only a human who could mop quickly fits that fact.  \n   – Greg is the single character with both motive (watching the game) and an alibi that actually gave him the tiny time window he needed (running out to the car with Dad).  Riding to the store was not alibi but camouflage.\n\nTherefore Greg is the thief, and he worked alone.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDad, Mom, Uncle Larry, Greg, Tina, Narrator, Dog (Darby)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nGreg (older brother)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Dad is basting the bird; Greg keeps one eye on the football game and the clock.  \n• Dad realises he forgot cranberry sauce and tells everyone he is dashing to the store.  \n• Greg instantly sees a way to delay dinner.  He offers to ride along with Dad, but first sprints to the kitchen.  \n• With no one watching (Tina and the narrator are outside with the dog, Mom is elsewhere in the house, and Uncle Larry is glued to the TV) Greg pulls the roasting pan from the oven, drags it toward the refrigerator, splashing juices as he goes.  \n• He shoves the whole pan inside the fridge, grabs a dish-cloth and wipes the first part of the trail—but he hears Dad’s car engine start.  In a rush he leaves the remaining half-trail, drops the cloth and races out the door, climbing into the car just in time.  \n• Dad and Greg return from the store.  Dad is beaming with cranberry sauce; Greg now has an apparently perfect alibi.  \n• Tina pieces the clues together—football motive, sudden disappearance, half-cleaned trail ending at the fridge—and realises the turkey is sitting, hidden but safe, on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Dad – he would never refrigerate a half-cooked bird; besides, he left the house and was gone the whole time.  \n• Mom – a skilled cook who knows a hot turkey does not belong in a refrigerator; she had no reason to hide it.  \n• Uncle Larry – never left the TV room until after the turkey vanished; brining after roasting is nonsensical.  \n• Tina and the narrator – were outside chaining the dog when the theft occurred.  \n• Darby the dog – can’t open refrigerators or wield a mop.  \nHence all others are cleared, and Greg alone is guilty of the Great Thanksgiving-Turkey Heist.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
