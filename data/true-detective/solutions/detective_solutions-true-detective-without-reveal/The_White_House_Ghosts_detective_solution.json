    "full_text": "The four ghosts took a look around the East Room before beginning their monthly card game. Invisible to all but themselves, they left no trace on the White House motion detectors. It was complete privacy, of a sort that each might have wished for when president. “I never cease to marvel at how this room has changed,” John Adams said. “Abigail and I used to come here to supervise matters when they were building the White House. Somehow, I never pictured this room quite so grand as it has become.” Andrew Jackson scoffed. “Well, John, that shouldn’t surprise you. I suspect that you wanted a grand setting all the time. I was never sure that you liked the people very much.” “That’s unfair, Andrew. We made the revolution for everyone. And as for a ‘grand setting,’ your inauguration certainly trashed the White House. Why, the only way they got rid of all of the drunks who invited themselves into the reception in this very room was to say that the drinks were being moved to the lawn. Then as the mob left, the White House staff shut the doors after them!” “Hardly my fault, John. Anyway, you talk about preserving the property, but I was the first to order spittoons for the East Room! I got into trouble for that, too, because of the expense. Well, OK, enough of that. Deal the cards, please.” Calvin Coolidge asked, “Is it true, Andrew, that ‘OK’ was what you initialled on state papers when you approved them? The rumor is that you thought that OK stood for ‘All Correct’!” “Too late now to stop that rumor, Calvin. If I didn’t do that, I should have. Besides, you’re the one with the reputation for not saying much.” Calvin Coolidge grinned. “Yes.” He looked at his cards. “One heart.” William Howard Taft shifted his weight as though he could still feel discomfort in his ghostly state. (Even as a ghost, he remained large.) “I still don’t see why the White House uses these little spindly chairs.” “William, did you really once get stuck in the bathtub?” William Howard Taft looked annoyed for a moment, then broke into a large smile. “Well yes, John. The White House ushers had quite a time getting me out! At least I was taking my bath in private. Unlike you, John. One spade.” “Hasn’t everyone heard that story by now? Well, I admit it: Washington was almost uninhabited then, very few visitors on horseback to be bothered with. I used to like to go swimming—skinny dipping I think they call it now—in the Potomac. And once some miscreant stole my clothes from the bank, so I had to send back to the White House for more. Two diamonds.” Andrew Jackson looked at his cards, folded them, and tossed them onto the table. “This isn’t a real game, not like poker. I don’t see why I let you fellows talk me into this. Let’s do something different this month.” “What did you have in mind?” “Well, you know, there is a new family residing in the White House. The election has been held, and the results tallied, and they have just moved in. You remember, eight years ago, the same thing happened. And surely you remember what we did then?” “Yes,” John Adams replied. “We left something for the children. When you put the idea forward then, you mentioned your adopted son, what a comfort he had been. It’s a wonderful tribute to him. I wonder if the last White House children ever figured out who our little mystery.” “Probably not,” said Calvin Coolidge. “But it’s a good idea, General. I remember how wonderful it was to have children in the White House. And animals—like my pet raccoon, Rebecca. The least we can do is make these new children feel welcome.” “What shall we leave?” William Howard Taft asked. “A mystery, like last time, that’ll be fun. Let’s leave a little something that is specific to one of our terms as president, and see if the girls know their history.” “OK,” said Andrew Jackson. “But what?” “Well,” replied William Howard Taft, “it shouldn’t be to hard to figure out. We each did other things besides serving as president. I mean, you, Andrew, were General Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. John was vice president, and an ambassador to France before that. I became Chief Justice of the United States after I left this miserable job, and Calvin was governor of Massachusetts. Together, we should figure out something!” “Yes,” Calvin Coolidge agreed. “And it should be something like the last time; that is, a symbol for peace. Begging your pardon, General, but after all the great wars we have seen, peace remains a great virtue. And it costs less, too! We were each lucky to have avoided great wars while we were in office.” “Not ‘lucky,’” grumbled John Adams. “It takes a lot of effort. Why, there were those who wanted war with France throughout my term. I wouldn’t give in. That’s surely why I was the first one term president!” “I just missed it. War during my presidency, I mean.” William Howard Taft reflected for a moment. “Now, Theodore Roosevelt might have enjoyed himself. He probably thought he was president at the wrong time anyway. But I’m sure that Woodrow Wilson, who came after me, had his hands full with the Great War. But we’re getting carried away here. Let’s get back to our mystery for the new White House children.” The ghosts put their heads together and discussed their game well into the night …\n\t\n**** The next morning, two excited little girls were awakened for breakfast. At their places at the breakfast table were a piece of paper and a small box. Their mother smiled indulgently, for surely her husband had left the note and box as a surprise for the children. The younger girl read the paper. It was in a clear script, bold and easy to read: “To the White House children—may your stay be filled with joy. Can you guess which one of us left this gift for you?” It was signed “Your friends, John Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, Calvin Coolidge.” The girls’ mother smiled at her husband, who returned the smile. The older girl opened the box. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. Inside was a large Christmas tree ornament, in the shape of the White House. On its side was a delicately painted scene, a view of the nation’s capital. A full eight inches across, the ornament would fit nicely on a large branch of a sturdy Christmas tree. “Look, here is where we stayed, before moving into the White House,” she said. “This little painting shows the view from our picture window at the Hay-Adams Hotel.” It was indeed, her mother noticed, except that there was a horse-drawn carriage painted into the scene. She wondered where her husband had found it. “I see a hinge on the side of that beautiful ornament—it might open up. Try it and see.” The little girl’s younger sister said, “My turn!” She lifted the top of the ornament and sure enough, it opened. Inside was painted another tiny scene, this one of the Statue of Liberty, with American flags unfurled. “They look like our flags, almost,” she said, “but the stars are too small to count.” There was, however, clearly visible in the harbor facing the statue, a ship, with soldiers on the deck. One of the soldiers, draped in a tricolor flag, seemed to be wearing a spiked helmet. At that moment, a White House waiter of long service appeared. The president looked at him quizzically. “Something like this happened eight years ago, sir,” the waiter said. “The girls then had a lot of fun trying to figure out which of the presidents who had signed their note might have left the gift, which was also a White House ornament. But it was quite different from this one.” The president whispered to his wife as he got up from the table to go to the Oval Office for the day’s business. “The letter from the last president told me about the ornament left for his children eight years ago. He was quite sure there would be a similar mystery left for our girls on their first morning at the White House!” He added, “I’m sure that you will help the children to figure out which one of my predecessors left this charming gift for them.” The president left the room, and the children, under the gentle prodding of their mother, soon resolved the mystery.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  From the note we know that only one of the four presidential ghosts actually fashioned the gift; the other three merely signed the covering note to help the children have some fun.\n\n2.  The ghosts agree that the present must (a) be “something that is specific to one of our terms as president,” and (b) be “a symbol for peace.”\n\n3.  What the girls find is a large CHRISTMAS-TREE ORNAMENT in the shape of the White House.  \n    •  The very idea of a White House Christmas ornament immediately points to President Calvin Coolidge.  In December 1923 he inaugurated the first “National Christmas Tree” on the Ellipse and started the modern White House Christmas-tree/ornament tradition.  \n    •  Every year since 1981 the White House Historical Association has issued an official Christmas ornament, and the 1983 and 1998 ornaments in that series both honour Coolidge for having begun the custom.  Of the four ghosts listed, only Coolidge has such a clear and well-known link with a White-House Christmas ornament.\n\n4.  The pictures painted on (and inside) the ornament reinforce that identification.  \n    •  Outside:  the White House as seen from the Hay-Adams Hotel.  The new First Family (the Obamas) really did live in that hotel just before moving across the street; putting that scene on the outside simply personalises the present for the two girls.  \n    •  Inside:  the Statue of Liberty (France → liberty) plus American flags, and on a troop-ship a soldier wearing a pickelhaube (German spiked helmet) but wrapped in the French tricolour.  France, Germany and the United States were the three principal nations that negotiated and signed the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, popularly called the “Pact of Paris,” renouncing war as an instrument of national policy.  The treaty was concluded, and ratified, while Calvin Coolidge was President, and it is the single most conspicuous “peace” achievement of his administration.  The mixing of the German helmet with the French flag is an unmistakable symbol of reconciliation.\n\n5.  No other president among the four can match this combination of clues:  \n    •  John Adams did make peace with France in 1800, but the Statue of Liberty did not exist until 1886, and a pickelhaube belongs to the 20th century, not the 18th.  \n    •  Andrew Jackson and William Howard Taft have no special connection either with Christmas ornaments or with a Franco-German-American peace pact.\n\n6.  Therefore the ornament is, unmistakably, the work of Calvin Coolidge.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohn Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, Calvin Coolidge\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCalvin Coolidge\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring their nightly card-game the four presidential ghosts decided, as they had eight years earlier, to leave a welcoming “mystery” for the new White House children.  They agreed the token should (1) be a symbol of peace and (2) point unmistakably to the presidential term of whichever one of them made it.\n\nBecause he is forever linked with the first National Christmas Tree (1923) and with the whole idea of White House Christmas ornaments, Calvin Coolidge volunteered.  That night he crafted an eight-inch, hinged White House ornament.\n\n•  On the outside he painted the view the girls had just enjoyed from the Hay-Adams Hotel, so they would know at once that the gift was meant especially for them.  \n•  Inside he painted the Statue of Liberty flanked by American flags, with a troopship carrying a German-helmeted soldier wrapped in the French tricolour—a miniature tableau symbolising the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, Coolidge’s own signature peace achievement.\n\nBefore dawn Coolidge silently placed the note and the ornament at the girls’ breakfast places and re-joined his companions in the East Room.  When the family awoke the “mystery” worked exactly as intended; the girls, helped by their mother, quickly realised that only President Coolidge fitted all the clues.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  John Adams:  Although he avoided war with France in 1800, nothing in the ornament points to his era (no sailing frigates, no 18th-century dress, Statue of Liberty not yet built).  He also has no connection with White House Christmas traditions.\n\n•  Andrew Jackson:  No link to France, Germany, the Statue of Liberty or Christmas-tree customs; the ornament contains nothing relating to the Battle of New Orleans or Jacksonian themes.\n\n•  William Howard Taft:  He championed arbitration treaties, but his presidency ended in 1913—before the Statue of Liberty scene showing post-WWI Franco-German reconciliation would make sense.  Again, no particular connection with White House Christmas ornaments.\n\nOnly Calvin Coolidge combines (a) the White House Christmas-ornament tradition and (b) a celebrated peace treaty involving France and Germany, exactly matching every detail painted on the mystery ornament.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "answer_options": "(a) Andrew Jackson; (b) Calvin Coolidge; (c) John Adams; (d) William Howard Taft",
    "correct_answer": "(b) Calvin Coolidge",
    "reveal_text": "There is a horse-drawn carriage painted on the ornament. There were so few people in Washington, let alone horseback or horse-drawn traffic, when John Adams was president, that he could go swimming in the Potomac River!\nA horse-drawn carriage could be seen in Washington during the other three presidencies, if only as an attraction for tourists. However, Andrew Jackson is further excluded by the Statue of Liberty, which was erected in 1886, a half-century after his presidency.\nThe ship with returning soldiers in New York Harbor could refer to either William Howard Taft (for the reference could be to the Spanish-American War, which ended a few years before his presidency), or to Calvin Coolidge, who would have remembered soldiers returning home from the Great War, now called the First World War, in 1919. The fact that a soldier is waving a souvenir French flag and is wearing a liberated German spiked helmet confirms the reference to Coolidge. That war was fought against Germany in France.\nWe do not know precisely what President Bush wrote to President Obama. As long as it remains a secret, we are quite sure that it refers to the White House Ghosts and their kindly tradition of leaving historical mysteries for White House children!",

It was complete privacy, of a sort that each might have wished for when president. “I never cease to marvel at how this room has changed,” John Adams said. “Abigail and I used to come here to supervise matters when they were building the White House. Somehow, I never pictured this room quite so grand as it has become.” Andrew Jackson scoffed. “Well, John, that shouldn’t surprise you. I suspect that you wanted a grand setting all the time. I was never sure that you liked the people very much.” “That’s unfair, Andrew. We made the revolution for everyone. And as for a ‘grand setting,’ your inauguration certainly trashed the White House. Why, the only way they got rid of all of the drunks who invited themselves into the reception in this very room was to say that the drinks were being moved to the lawn. Then as the mob left, the White House staff shut the doors after them!” “Hardly my fault, John. Anyway, you talk about preserving the property, but I was the first to order spittoons for the East Room! I got into trouble for that, too, because of the expense. Well, OK, enough of that. Deal the cards, please.” Calvin Coolidge asked, “Is it true, Andrew, that ‘OK’ was what you initialled on state papers when you approved them? The rumor is that you thought that OK stood for ‘All Correct’!” “Too late now to stop that rumor, Calvin. If I didn’t do that, I should have. Besides, you’re the one with the reputation for not saying much.” Calvin Coolidge grinned. “Yes.” He looked at his cards. “One heart.” William Howard Taft shifted his weight as though he could still feel discomfort in his ghostly state. (Even as a ghost, he remained large.) “I still don’t see why the White House uses these little spindly chairs.” “William, did you really once get stuck in the bathtub?” William Howard Taft looked annoyed for a moment, then broke into a large smile. “Well yes, John. The White House ushers had quite a time getting me out! At least I was taking my bath in private. Unlike you, John. One spade.” “Hasn’t everyone heard that story by now? Well, I admit it: Washington was almost uninhabited then, very few visitors on horseback to be bothered with. I used to like to go swimming—skinny dipping I think they call it now—in the Potomac. And once some miscreant stole my clothes from the bank, so I had to send back to the White House for more. Two diamonds.” Andrew Jackson looked at his cards, folded them, and tossed them onto the table. “This isn’t a real game, not like poker. I don’t see why I let you fellows talk me into this. Let’s do something different this month.” “What did you have in mind?” “Well, you know, there is a new family residing in the White House. The election has been held, and the results tallied, and they have just moved in. You remember, eight years ago, the same thing happened. And surely you remember what we did then?” “Yes,” John Adams replied. “We left something for the children. When you put the idea forward then, you mentioned your adopted son, what a comfort he had been. It’s a wonderful tribute to him. I wonder if the last White House children ever figured out who our little mystery.” “Probably not,” said Calvin Coolidge. “But it’s a good idea, General. I remember how wonderful it was to have children in the White House. And animals—like my pet raccoon, Rebecca. The least we can do is make these new children feel welcome.” “What shall we leave?” William Howard Taft asked. “A mystery, like last time, that’ll be fun. Let’s leave a little something that is specific to one of our terms as president, and see if the girls know their history.” “OK,” said Andrew Jackson. “But what?” “Well,” replied William Howard Taft, “it shouldn’t be to hard to figure out. We each did other things besides serving as president. I mean, you, Andrew, were General Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. John was vice president, and an ambassador to France before that. I became Chief Justice of the United States after I left this miserable job, and Calvin was governor of Massachusetts. Together, we should figure out something!” “Yes,” Calvin Coolidge agreed. “And it should be something like the last time; that is, a symbol for peace. Begging your pardon, General, but after all the great wars we have seen, peace remains a great virtue. And it costs less, too! We were each lucky to have avoided great wars while we were in office.” “Not ‘lucky,’” grumbled John Adams. “It takes a lot of effort. Why, there were those who wanted war with France throughout my term. I wouldn’t give in. That’s surely why I was the first one term president!” “I just missed it. War during my presidency, I mean.” William Howard Taft reflected for a moment. “Now, Theodore Roosevelt might have enjoyed himself. He probably thought he was president at the wrong time anyway. But I’m sure that Woodrow Wilson, who came after me, had his hands full with the Great War. But we’re getting carried away here. Let’s get back to our mystery for the new White House children.” The ghosts put their heads together and discussed their game well into the night …\n\t\n**** The next morning, two excited little girls were awakened for breakfast. At their places at the breakfast table were a piece of paper and a small box. Their mother smiled indulgently, for surely her husband had left the note and box as a surprise for the children. The younger girl read the paper. It was in a clear script, bold and easy to read: “To the White House children—may your stay be filled with joy. Can you guess which one of us left this gift for you?” It was signed “Your friends, John Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, Calvin Coolidge.” The girls’ mother smiled at her husband, who returned the smile. The older girl opened the box. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. Inside was a large Christmas tree ornament, in the shape of the White House. On its side was a delicately painted scene, a view of the nation’s capital. A full eight inches across, the ornament would fit nicely on a large branch of a sturdy Christmas tree. “Look, here is where we stayed, before moving into the White House,” she said. “This little painting shows the view from our picture window at the Hay-Adams Hotel.” It was indeed, her mother noticed, except that there was a horse-drawn carriage painted into the scene. She wondered where her husband had found it. “I see a hinge on the side of that beautiful ornament—it might open up. Try it and see.” The little girl’s younger sister said, “My turn!” She lifted the top of the ornament and sure enough, it opened. Inside was painted another tiny scene, this one of the Statue of Liberty, with American flags unfurled. “They look like our flags, almost,” she said, “but the stars are too small to count.” There was, however, clearly visible in the harbor facing the statue, a ship, with soldiers on the deck. One of the soldiers, draped in a tricolor flag, seemed to be wearing a spiked helmet. At that moment, a White House waiter of long service appeared. The president looked at him quizzically. “Something like this happened eight years ago, sir,” the waiter said. “The girls then had a lot of fun trying to figure out which of the presidents who had signed their note might have left the gift, which was also a White House ornament. But it was quite different from this one.” The president whispered to his wife as he got up from the table to go to the Oval Office for the day’s business. “The letter from the last president told me about the ornament left for his children eight years ago. He was quite sure there would be a similar mystery left for our girls on their first morning at the White House!” He added, “I’m sure that you will help the children to figure out which one of my predecessors left this charming gift for them.” The president left the room, and the children, under the gentle prodding of their mother, soon resolved the mystery.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Andrew Jackson; (b) Calvin Coolidge; (c) John Adams; (d) William Howard Taft",
      "answer": "(b) Calvin Coolidge",
      "outcome": "There is a horse-drawn carriage painted on the ornament. There were so few people in Washington, let alone horseback or horse-drawn traffic, when John Adams was president, that he could go swimming in the Potomac River!\nA horse-drawn carriage could be seen in Washington during the other three presidencies, if only as an attraction for tourists. However, Andrew Jackson is further excluded by the Statue of Liberty, which was erected in 1886, a half-century after his presidency.\nThe ship with returning soldiers in New York Harbor could refer to either William Howard Taft (for the reference could be to the Spanish-American War, which ended a few years before his presidency), or to Calvin Coolidge, who would have remembered soldiers returning home from the Great War, now called the First World War, in 1919. The fact that a soldier is waving a souvenir French flag and is wearing a liberated German spiked helmet confirms the reference to Coolidge. That war was fought against Germany in France.\nWe do not know precisely what President Bush wrote to President Obama. As long as it remains a secret, we are quite sure that it refers to the White House Ghosts and their kindly tradition of leaving historical mysteries for White House children!"
