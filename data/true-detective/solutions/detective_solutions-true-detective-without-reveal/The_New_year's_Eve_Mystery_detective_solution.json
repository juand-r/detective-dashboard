    "full_text": "New Year’s Eve, 2009, was a night that Blake Sloan had looked forward to for a long time. Tonight, he and his wife Mary Beth would host a New Year’s mystery party. Mary Beth had first thought of this back in the summer, but it was Blake that had gotten excited about the idea. He had planned and prepared for this night since before Labor Day. The format was simple. There would be six in attendance at the party and one of them would be “murdered. There would be five clues, one pointing to each of the five “suspects”. Four of the clues would be false. The fifth one would be true and tag the “murderer.” All of their guests, which consisted of the Kings and the Wades, had arrived at the Sloan home by 7:00 p.m. The party started out innocently enough, with dinner and cocktails. Since it was New Year’s Eve, there was ample liquid refreshment but the guests had been cautioned about drinking too much because Blake wanted everyone to be able to participate fully in the murder mystery. It was understood that the mystery would begin after dinner. Blake offered an admonition, saying, “Pay close attention to everything that happens when we leave the dining room.” Mary Beth hosted an excellent meal and then invited everyone to the den, carrying a tray of various beverages. The Sloan home was a spacious two-story house with large rooms and high ceilings. She and Blake agreed that the floor plan of their home was perfect for a murder mystery party. As the guests settled into the comfortable seating in the den, the party appeared to proceed as normal. Hot coffee and brandy were served by Mary Beth, who made it a point to keep the cap on the brandy decanter, and soon everyone was in animated conversation. After about 15 minutes, the doorbell rang. Blake excused himself to answer and see whom it was, leaving his tumbler of brandy on a lamp table by where he was sitting. It was their next-door neighbors, the Perkins, wishing them a Happy New Year. Blake yelled to the others that he would return to the den in a few minutes. Just as he said this, the telephone rang. Mary Beth said, “Oh! That may be my sister Jo! She lives out of state and her husband has been ill. I had better answer in the kitchen.” In her haste, she tripped on the leg of the table where Blake’s drink sat, spilling a small amount of it on the cherry wood finish. Very quickly, The Wades and Kings were left alone in the den. They smiled in amusement, for they realized the game was underway. But, before they had an opportunity to discuss it, a loud noise came from upstairs. Mary Beth poked her head out of the kitchen and said, “That’s got to be the new mirror we installed in the game room. I hope it’s not broken! Roy, can you go check on it?” Roy, sitting right by the den door to the hallway, quickly ran upstairs, knowing it was part of the setup but still excited about what he may find in the game room. All he found was a tape recorder set to loud volume which been activated by a timing device. While Roy was upstairs pondering the tape recording and timing device, Blake returned from the front door just long enough to ask Juanita to join her husband upstairs. Juanita, excited by the game, which was now in full swing, clasped both hands tightly to her mouth as she ran out of the den to join Roy in the upper level game room. At this moment, they heard a scream coming from the kitchen. First Noel and then Theresa King ran to see what had happened. Mary Beth had fainted and fallen on the floor. The telephone was still in her hand. After a moment, she was revived and said to Theresa, weakly, “Theresa, please get me a cold wash cloth. They are in the bathroom, on the other side of the house, opposite from the den.” Now, it was only Mary Beth and Noel King in the kitchen. Noel stood by her, not knowing what to do. Mary Beth handed him the phone and said, “Please redial the number and tell Jo I’m OK.” As Noel did as Mary Beth asked, Blake said goodbye to the neighbors, returned to the den and was now alone. Seeing the splash on the table, he refreshed his drink from the refreshment table decanter and took a sip. After a short moment, he choked and lost consciousness. He was dead by poison from the brandy. The cap had not been removed from the brandy decanter since before Blake answered the doorbell. Scarcely ten minutes had passed. Blake lay “dead” on the floor of the den. Mary Beth had been “revived” in the kitchen by the Kings. They returned to the den and found the Wades just coming down from the upstairs. Once they had gathered in the den, they examined the “body”. The brandy snifter was still firmly in his grasp. At this point, Blake arose and told his guests, “I drank poisoned brandy. Who poisoned it? The murder is solved when it is determined who did it, but if you can tell me how it was done, you will be a super sleuth.” Smiling, he added, “Everyone, please take a seat and rest assured the drinks are safe. Let’s discuss who murdered me. The person who solves the mystery will receive a nice door prize.” Mary Beth and Blake’s guests were savoring every moment of the New Year’s Eve mystery and seemed in no hurry to bring it to conclusion. When Blake poured a second stiff whisky and soda for Noel, he decided they had better solve the case before further partying. He nodded at Mary Beth and she picked up on his cue, asking for silence and saying, “OK, who killed my husband?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  We know Blake and Mary-Beth prepared a mystery with five apparent clues, four of them false and one true.  \n2.  Death occurred when Blake took the drink that had been standing on the lamp table.  The decanter itself was never opened (its cap “had not been removed” after Blake left to answer the door-bell).  Therefore the poison CANNOT have been put in the decanter – it had to be on (or in) the brandy glass itself BEFORE Blake walked out of the room.  \n3.  Who had a real chance to touch that glass before Blake left the room?  \n • Only Mary-Beth.  She served the drinks, set the glass down in front of Blake and then – “in her haste” – deliberately “tripped,” striking the very table on which the glass sat and spilling a little brandy. While wiping up the spill she could easily rub a fast-acting, tasteless poison on the rim of the snifter.  \n4.  After that moment the four guests are the only ones left in the den, but none of them ever approach the brandy glass again:  \n • Roy is sent upstairs.  \n • Blake briefly appears only to send Juanita after her husband.  \n • Juanita leaves the den immediately.  \n • While Noel and Theresa are alone in the room they are BOTH present, so neither can act unseen; seconds later they both run to the kitchen, leaving the den empty.  \n • From then until Blake returns the glass is untouched.  \n Thus no guest really has the opportunity to add poison unnoticed.  \n5.  Mary-Beth’s convenient “fainting spell” is an additional ploy to draw attention away from herself and to empty the den so Blake can return alone and drink the poisoned brandy.  \n6.  Motive inside the game: none of the guests has a stated motive, but Mary-Beth – the co-hostess – has the strongest dramatic motive to be the “killer” in a party they themselves devised.  \n7.  Therefore the single true clue is Mary-Beth’s spill.  All the other apparently suspicious happenings (Roy’s trip upstairs, Juanita’s dash after him, Mary-Beth’s faint, Noel’s phone call, the empty den) are deliberate red herrings planned by the hosts.  \n8.  Logical deduction:  Only Mary-Beth both (a) had certain opportunity to tamper with the glass, and (b) could do so without being observed.  She is the murderer.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMary Beth Sloan, Roy Wade, Juanita Wade, Theresa King, Noel King\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMary Beth Sloan\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Mary-Beth had prepared a hand-kerchief (or the sleeve of her blouse) impregnated with a quick-acting, tasteless poison.  \n•  While she was serving coffee and brandy she deliberately kept the decanter capped so later no one could claim the poison was in the bottle.  \n•  At the signal of the telephone ring she “tripped,” striking Blake’s table and splashing a little of his drink.  Bending over, she dabbed the table and, in the same motion, wiped the rim of Blake’s snifter with the poisoned cloth.  The tiny spill also lowered the level of the brandy so Blake would feel the need to “refresh” his drink and take a good swallow.  \n•  She hurried off to the kitchen, leaving the four guests to see the start of the “game.”  \n•  A sequence of planned distractions (the loud crash upstairs, Roy’s investigation, Juanita’s summons, Mary-Beth’s own staged faint) cleared the den so the glass remained untouched by anyone else until Blake returned alone.  \n•  Blake raised the glass, the poison on the rim dissolved into the fresh brandy that touched his lips, and he collapsed in the centre of the den.  \n•  The mystery portion of the party was now ready for the guests to solve.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Roy Wade – was upstairs from the moment the “mirror” crashed until after Blake’s collapse; never in reach of the brandy glass.  \n•  Juanita Wade – left the den when Blake asked her to join Roy; could not get near the glass again before Blake drank.  \n•  Theresa King – remained with Noel until both ran to the kitchen; she could not act unseen and had no solitary access to the glass.  \n•  Noel King – likewise was never alone with the brandy glass; while he and Theresa were together either could have seen any tampering.  \nThus none of the four guests ever had exclusive opportunity; only Mary-Beth did.  Hence she is the sole killer in the mystery party.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Laughter ensued but Noel said, “Blake was alone in the den. Who’s to say?”\nHis wife Theresa answered, “Ah – but the brandy was poisoned.”\n“And he was alone in the den for only a short minute or two,” offered Juanita.\nRoy said, “I was the first to leave the den.”\n“No, I was, corrected Mary Beth.”\n“No, I was,” said Blake to his wife, “but since I did not poison myself, that is an acceptable claim.”\nFor a moment, everyone sat in silence, the leftover Christmas mistletoe over the den door looking forlorn as if a real murder had occurred. Finally, Theresa said, “I was the last person out of the den. I believe I can resolve this and then we can wait to usher in 2010.”\nBlake’s brown eyes twinkled, matching closely the amber colored liquid in his snifter. Grinning at Theresa, he asked, “Can you be a super sleuth?”\n“I think so,” she replied. Theresa had assumed a very serious demeanor. At least for the time being she was taking her role as detective seriously. She felt like one of the old-fashioned movie detectives as she began explaining.\n“I can begin by telling you who didn’t murder you, Blake. First of all, the poison was placed in your snifter. I noticed the decanter cap was in place before you answered the door and stayed put until I ran into the kitchen behind Noel. But, that’s not really how I know who the murderer is.”\nBlake’s eyes continued to twinkle and a sly smile crossed Mary Beth’s face as Theresa continued, “Well, it wasn’t me. Noel was in the den with me right up until we heard Mary Beth scream. When I left her to get the washcloth, I went to the bathroom opposite the den. I never had opportunity to poison your drink. The same is true for Noel. He was busy making a call to Mary Beth’s sister during that short time that the den was empty before Blake returned.”\n“Now, as we work backwards, recall that you asked Juanita to join Roy upstairs to investigate the noise. Juanita ran from the room with her hands in front of her face, just like this was a real murder. Certainly, she could not have poisoned your drink. The same is true of Roy. He sat right by the den door and was never anywhere near you or your brandy snifter.”\nSmiling broadly now, Theresa looked at Mary Beth and gently chided her, saying, “shame on you for killing your husband! You ran out of the room and pretended to stumble on the table leg. The liquid splashed was not brandy from Blake’s snifter, but a small amount of the ‘poison’ you hurriedly slipped into it. I realize as I think this through that you are the only one who could have poisoned the drink.”\nBlake and Mary Beth laughed, saying, “Congratulations, Super Sleuth!” Playfully grabbing her husband and leading him to the mistletoe under the door, she tenderly kissed him. Softly, she added, “I’ve been mad enough to kill him a time or two!\nAn appreciative Blake returned his wife’s affection and added, “If this is the kiss of death, I’m more than ready for 2010!\nTheresa asked, “So, what’s the door prize?”\nMary Beth retrieved a thick leather bound volume of “The Complete Works of Miss Mary Jane Marple,” the female amateur detective that Agatha Christie had made famous. Handing it to Theresa, she said, “I’m glad one of you girls solved the murder. Miss Marple could not have done better!”",

      "outcome": "Laughter ensued but Noel said, “Blake was alone in the den. Who’s to say?”\nHis wife Theresa answered, “Ah – but the brandy was poisoned.”\n“And he was alone in the den for only a short minute or two,” offered Juanita.\nRoy said, “I was the first to leave the den.”\n“No, I was, corrected Mary Beth.”\n“No, I was,” said Blake to his wife, “but since I did not poison myself, that is an acceptable claim.”\nFor a moment, everyone sat in silence, the leftover Christmas mistletoe over the den door looking forlorn as if a real murder had occurred. Finally, Theresa said, “I was the last person out of the den. I believe I can resolve this and then we can wait to usher in 2010.”\nBlake’s brown eyes twinkled, matching closely the amber colored liquid in his snifter. Grinning at Theresa, he asked, “Can you be a super sleuth?”\n“I think so,” she replied. Theresa had assumed a very serious demeanor. At least for the time being she was taking her role as detective seriously. She felt like one of the old-fashioned movie detectives as she began explaining.\n“I can begin by telling you who didn’t murder you, Blake. First of all, the poison was placed in your snifter. I noticed the decanter cap was in place before you answered the door and stayed put until I ran into the kitchen behind Noel. But, that’s not really how I know who the murderer is.”\nBlake’s eyes continued to twinkle and a sly smile crossed Mary Beth’s face as Theresa continued, “Well, it wasn’t me. Noel was in the den with me right up until we heard Mary Beth scream. When I left her to get the washcloth, I went to the bathroom opposite the den. I never had opportunity to poison your drink. The same is true for Noel. He was busy making a call to Mary Beth’s sister during that short time that the den was empty before Blake returned.”\n“Now, as we work backwards, recall that you asked Juanita to join Roy upstairs to investigate the noise. Juanita ran from the room with her hands in front of her face, just like this was a real murder. Certainly, she could not have poisoned your drink. The same is true of Roy. He sat right by the den door and was never anywhere near you or your brandy snifter.”\nSmiling broadly now, Theresa looked at Mary Beth and gently chided her, saying, “shame on you for killing your husband! You ran out of the room and pretended to stumble on the table leg. The liquid splashed was not brandy from Blake’s snifter, but a small amount of the ‘poison’ you hurriedly slipped into it. I realize as I think this through that you are the only one who could have poisoned the drink.”\nBlake and Mary Beth laughed, saying, “Congratulations, Super Sleuth!” Playfully grabbing her husband and leading him to the mistletoe under the door, she tenderly kissed him. Softly, she added, “I’ve been mad enough to kill him a time or two!\nAn appreciative Blake returned his wife’s affection and added, “If this is the kiss of death, I’m more than ready for 2010!\nTheresa asked, “So, what’s the door prize?”\nMary Beth retrieved a thick leather bound volume of “The Complete Works of Miss Mary Jane Marple,” the female amateur detective that Agatha Christie had made famous. Handing it to Theresa, she said, “I’m glad one of you girls solved the murder. Miss Marple could not have done better!”"
