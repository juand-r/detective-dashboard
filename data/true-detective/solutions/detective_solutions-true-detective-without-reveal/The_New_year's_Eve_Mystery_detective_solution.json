    "full_text": "New Year’s Eve, 2009, was a night that Blake Sloan had looked forward to for a long time. Tonight, he and his wife Mary Beth would host a New Year’s mystery party. Mary Beth had first thought of this back in the summer, but it was Blake that had gotten excited about the idea. He had planned and prepared for this night since before Labor Day. The format was simple. There would be six in attendance at the party and one of them would be “murdered. There would be five clues, one pointing to each of the five “suspects”. Four of the clues would be false. The fifth one would be true and tag the “murderer.” All of their guests, which consisted of the Kings and the Wades, had arrived at the Sloan home by 7:00 p.m. The party started out innocently enough, with dinner and cocktails. Since it was New Year’s Eve, there was ample liquid refreshment but the guests had been cautioned about drinking too much because Blake wanted everyone to be able to participate fully in the murder mystery. It was understood that the mystery would begin after dinner. Blake offered an admonition, saying, “Pay close attention to everything that happens when we leave the dining room.” Mary Beth hosted an excellent meal and then invited everyone to the den, carrying a tray of various beverages. The Sloan home was a spacious two-story house with large rooms and high ceilings. She and Blake agreed that the floor plan of their home was perfect for a murder mystery party. As the guests settled into the comfortable seating in the den, the party appeared to proceed as normal. Hot coffee and brandy were served by Mary Beth, who made it a point to keep the cap on the brandy decanter, and soon everyone was in animated conversation. After about 15 minutes, the doorbell rang. Blake excused himself to answer and see whom it was, leaving his tumbler of brandy on a lamp table by where he was sitting. It was their next-door neighbors, the Perkins, wishing them a Happy New Year. Blake yelled to the others that he would return to the den in a few minutes. Just as he said this, the telephone rang. Mary Beth said, “Oh! That may be my sister Jo! She lives out of state and her husband has been ill. I had better answer in the kitchen.” In her haste, she tripped on the leg of the table where Blake’s drink sat, spilling a small amount of it on the cherry wood finish. Very quickly, The Wades and Kings were left alone in the den. They smiled in amusement, for they realized the game was underway. But, before they had an opportunity to discuss it, a loud noise came from upstairs. Mary Beth poked her head out of the kitchen and said, “That’s got to be the new mirror we installed in the game room. I hope it’s not broken! Roy, can you go check on it?” Roy, sitting right by the den door to the hallway, quickly ran upstairs, knowing it was part of the setup but still excited about what he may find in the game room. All he found was a tape recorder set to loud volume which been activated by a timing device. While Roy was upstairs pondering the tape recording and timing device, Blake returned from the front door just long enough to ask Juanita to join her husband upstairs. Juanita, excited by the game, which was now in full swing, clasped both hands tightly to her mouth as she ran out of the den to join Roy in the upper level game room. At this moment, they heard a scream coming from the kitchen. First Noel and then Theresa King ran to see what had happened. Mary Beth had fainted and fallen on the floor. The telephone was still in her hand. After a moment, she was revived and said to Theresa, weakly, “Theresa, please get me a cold wash cloth. They are in the bathroom, on the other side of the house, opposite from the den.” Now, it was only Mary Beth and Noel King in the kitchen. Noel stood by her, not knowing what to do. Mary Beth handed him the phone and said, “Please redial the number and tell Jo I’m OK.” As Noel did as Mary Beth asked, Blake said goodbye to the neighbors, returned to the den and was now alone. Seeing the splash on the table, he refreshed his drink from the refreshment table decanter and took a sip. After a short moment, he choked and lost consciousness. He was dead by poison from the brandy. The cap had not been removed from the brandy decanter since before Blake answered the doorbell. Scarcely ten minutes had passed. Blake lay “dead” on the floor of the den. Mary Beth had been “revived” in the kitchen by the Kings. They returned to the den and found the Wades just coming down from the upstairs. Once they had gathered in the den, they examined the “body”. The brandy snifter was still firmly in his grasp. At this point, Blake arose and told his guests, “I drank poisoned brandy. Who poisoned it? The murder is solved when it is determined who did it, but if you can tell me how it was done, you will be a super sleuth.” Smiling, he added, “Everyone, please take a seat and rest assured the drinks are safe. Let’s discuss who murdered me. The person who solves the mystery will receive a nice door prize.” Mary Beth and Blake’s guests were savoring every moment of the New Year’s Eve mystery and seemed in no hurry to bring it to conclusion. When Blake poured a second stiff whisky and soda for Noel, he decided they had better solve the case before further partying. He nodded at Mary Beth and she picked up on his cue, asking for silence and saying, “OK, who killed my husband?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWhat actually killed Blake was the brandy that was already in his glass, not the brandy that came out of the decanter when he “topped-off” the drink.  \n2.\tTherefore the only person who could have introduced the poison was someone who handled Blake’s glass before he left it on the lamp table.  \n3.\tThe glass was poured and handed to Blake by only one person – his wife, Mary Beth – when coffee and brandy were first served.  \n4.\tWhile everyone was in the den Blake took at least one healthy swallow of the drink and felt no ill-effects, so the poison could not have been in the liquid portion of the brandy.  \n5.\tThat means it had to be in, or on, the glass in such a form that a fatal dose did not get into Blake’s system until he later refilled the glass.  \n6.\tThe simplest way to do this is to coat the inside of the glass just above the surface of the brandy with a fast-acting but tasteless poison (for example powdered cyanide or powdered aconitine).  As long as the original liquid level remained below the coating Blake was safe; when Mary Beth “accidentally” kicked the table and spilled some of his drink, the liquid level dropped still farther and the coating remained dry.  \n7.\tWhen Blake came back, noticed the spill, and refilled the glass the liquid level rose, dissolved the powder, and he swallowed a lethal dose within a few seconds.  \n8.\tAfter dinner Mary Beth never again had to get near the glass, the table, or the decanter.  The cap on the decanter could stay on forever; it had nothing to do with the murder.\n9.\tAll of the elaborate comings-and-goings (doorbell, telephone call, crashing tape recorder, Juanita and Roy being sent upstairs, Mary Beth’s fainting spell, Theresa’s trip clear across the house) were merely distractions arranged by Mary Beth so that no one would pay close attention to how, or when, Blake died.\n10.\tEveryone else had either no access to the glass, no time, or at least one witness beside them for every second that mattered.  Only Mary Beth had the motive (she wanted to be the successful “killer” in her husband’s mystery game) and the uninterrupted opportunity (while she poured the first round of drinks) to prepare the fatal brandy glass.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMary Beth Sloan, Roy Wade, Juanita Wade, Noel King, Theresa King\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMary Beth Sloan\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•\tBefore the party Mary Beth coated the inside of Blake’s brandy snifter, just above the point to which she intended to pour, with a thin ring of fast-acting, tasteless poison.  The poison would stay dry and harmless as long as the liquid level never reached it.  \n•\tDuring the after-dinner coffee she poured Blake’s drink, stopping the flow just below the poisoned ring, then ostentatiously replaced the stopper on the decanter so that everyone would later remember it had never been removed.  \n•\tBlake drank safely for a few minutes.  \n•\tThe series of distractions began:  \n   –\tThe doorbell (pre-arranged with the Perkins) drew Blake from the room.  \n   –\tThe telephone “call from Jo” took Mary Beth to the kitchen.  \n   –\tMary Beth deliberately “tripped” and jostled the table, spilling some brandy from Blake’s glass and lowering the liquid level still farther below the poisoned ring.  \n   –\tThe timed crash upstairs sent Roy away and prompted Blake, on a second entrance, to send Juanita after him.  \n   –\tMary Beth’s staged fainting fit pulled both Kings as well as Theresa (for a washcloth) out of the room.  \n•\tFor thirty seconds the den was completely empty; however, that was irrelevant—the murder mechanism had been set hours earlier.  \n•\tBlake came back alone, saw the spill, picked up his glass, walked to the sideboard, removed the stopper himself, and refilled.  The rising brandy dissolved the poisoned coating.  \n•\tHe took a swallow, collapsed, and “died.”  \n•\tMary Beth, the only person who had physically prepared the glass and who engineered every distraction, was the murderer.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nRoy Wade – From the moment Blake left the den Roy was never alone with the glass.  Juanita, Noel and Theresa were next to him until he was sent upstairs, and he did not come down until after Blake had collapsed.  \n\nJuanita Wade – She was in the den only while Noel and Theresa were present; immediately afterward Blake re-entered, spoke to her, and she went upstairs.  She never again approached the brandy glass.  \n\nNoel King – When Blake returned and refilled his drink Noel was in the kitchen with Mary Beth, redialling the telephone.  He could not reach the den unseen or unnoticed.  \n\nTheresa King – Theresa was on the far side of the house fetching the washcloth during the critical moment.  \n\nIn short, none of the four guests ever had the brandy glass in his or her hands, much less the uninterrupted, witnessed-by-no-one opportunity that Mary Beth had when she poured it in the first place.  Only Mary Beth Sloan could have poisoned Blake.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Laughter ensued but Noel said, “Blake was alone in the den. Who’s to say?”\nHis wife Theresa answered, “Ah – but the brandy was poisoned.”\n“And he was alone in the den for only a short minute or two,” offered Juanita.\nRoy said, “I was the first to leave the den.”\n“No, I was, corrected Mary Beth.”\n“No, I was,” said Blake to his wife, “but since I did not poison myself, that is an acceptable claim.”\nFor a moment, everyone sat in silence, the leftover Christmas mistletoe over the den door looking forlorn as if a real murder had occurred. Finally, Theresa said, “I was the last person out of the den. I believe I can resolve this and then we can wait to usher in 2010.”\nBlake’s brown eyes twinkled, matching closely the amber colored liquid in his snifter. Grinning at Theresa, he asked, “Can you be a super sleuth?”\n“I think so,” she replied. Theresa had assumed a very serious demeanor. At least for the time being she was taking her role as detective seriously. She felt like one of the old-fashioned movie detectives as she began explaining.\n“I can begin by telling you who didn’t murder you, Blake. First of all, the poison was placed in your snifter. I noticed the decanter cap was in place before you answered the door and stayed put until I ran into the kitchen behind Noel. But, that’s not really how I know who the murderer is.”\nBlake’s eyes continued to twinkle and a sly smile crossed Mary Beth’s face as Theresa continued, “Well, it wasn’t me. Noel was in the den with me right up until we heard Mary Beth scream. When I left her to get the washcloth, I went to the bathroom opposite the den. I never had opportunity to poison your drink. The same is true for Noel. He was busy making a call to Mary Beth’s sister during that short time that the den was empty before Blake returned.”\n“Now, as we work backwards, recall that you asked Juanita to join Roy upstairs to investigate the noise. Juanita ran from the room with her hands in front of her face, just like this was a real murder. Certainly, she could not have poisoned your drink. The same is true of Roy. He sat right by the den door and was never anywhere near you or your brandy snifter.”\nSmiling broadly now, Theresa looked at Mary Beth and gently chided her, saying, “shame on you for killing your husband! You ran out of the room and pretended to stumble on the table leg. The liquid splashed was not brandy from Blake’s snifter, but a small amount of the ‘poison’ you hurriedly slipped into it. I realize as I think this through that you are the only one who could have poisoned the drink.”\nBlake and Mary Beth laughed, saying, “Congratulations, Super Sleuth!” Playfully grabbing her husband and leading him to the mistletoe under the door, she tenderly kissed him. Softly, she added, “I’ve been mad enough to kill him a time or two!\nAn appreciative Blake returned his wife’s affection and added, “If this is the kiss of death, I’m more than ready for 2010!\nTheresa asked, “So, what’s the door prize?”\nMary Beth retrieved a thick leather bound volume of “The Complete Works of Miss Mary Jane Marple,” the female amateur detective that Agatha Christie had made famous. Handing it to Theresa, she said, “I’m glad one of you girls solved the murder. Miss Marple could not have done better!”",

Mary Beth said, “Oh! That may be my sister Jo! She lives out of state and her husband has been ill.

Very quickly, The Wades and Kings were left alone in the den. They smiled in amusement, for they realized the game was underway.

Mary Beth poked her head out of the kitchen and said, “That’s got to be the new mirror we installed in the game room. I hope it’s not broken! Roy, can you go check on it?” Roy, sitting right by the den door to the hallway, quickly ran upstairs, knowing it was part of the setup but still excited about what he may find in the game room. All he found was a tape recorder set to loud volume which been activated by a timing device. While Roy was upstairs pondering the tape recording and timing device, Blake returned from the front door just long enough to ask Juanita to join her husband upstairs. Juanita, excited by the game, which was now in full swing, clasped both hands tightly to her mouth as she ran out of the den to join Roy in the upper level game room. At this moment, they heard a scream coming from the kitchen. First Noel and then Theresa King ran to see what had happened. Mary Beth had fainted and fallen on the floor. The telephone was still in her hand. After a moment, she was revived and said to Theresa, weakly, “Theresa, please get me a cold wash cloth.

Mary Beth handed him the phone and said, “Please redial the number and tell Jo I’m OK.” As Noel did as Mary Beth asked, Blake said goodbye to the neighbors, returned to the den and was now alone. Seeing the splash on the table, he refreshed his drink from the refreshment table decanter and took a sip. After a short moment, he choked and lost consciousness. He was dead by poison from the brandy. The cap had not been removed from the brandy decanter since before Blake answered the doorbell. Scarcely ten minutes had passed. Blake lay “dead” on the floor of the den. Mary Beth had been “revived” in the kitchen by the Kings. They returned to the den and found the Wades just coming down from the upstairs. Once they had gathered in the den, they examined the “body”. The brandy snifter was still firmly in his grasp. At this point, Blake arose and told his guests, “I drank poisoned brandy. Who poisoned it? The murder is solved when it is determined who did it, but if you can tell me how it was done, you will be a super sleuth.” Smiling, he added, “Everyone, please take a seat and rest assured the drinks are safe. Let’s discuss who murdered me. The person who solves the mystery will receive a nice door prize.” Mary Beth and Blake’s guests were savoring every moment of the New Year’s Eve mystery and seemed in no hurry to bring it to conclusion.

      "answer_options": "(a) Juanita Wade; (b) Mary Beth Sloan; (c) Noel King; (d) Roy Wade; (e) Theresa King",
      "answer": "(b) Mary Beth Sloan",
      "outcome": "Laughter ensued but Noel said, “Blake was alone in the den. Who’s to say?”\nHis wife Theresa answered, “Ah – but the brandy was poisoned.”\n“And he was alone in the den for only a short minute or two,” offered Juanita.\nRoy said, “I was the first to leave the den.”\n“No, I was, corrected Mary Beth.”\n“No, I was,” said Blake to his wife, “but since I did not poison myself, that is an acceptable claim.”\nFor a moment, everyone sat in silence, the leftover Christmas mistletoe over the den door looking forlorn as if a real murder had occurred. Finally, Theresa said, “I was the last person out of the den. I believe I can resolve this and then we can wait to usher in 2010.”\nBlake’s brown eyes twinkled, matching closely the amber colored liquid in his snifter. Grinning at Theresa, he asked, “Can you be a super sleuth?”\n“I think so,” she replied. Theresa had assumed a very serious demeanor. At least for the time being she was taking her role as detective seriously. She felt like one of the old-fashioned movie detectives as she began explaining.\n“I can begin by telling you who didn’t murder you, Blake. First of all, the poison was placed in your snifter. I noticed the decanter cap was in place before you answered the door and stayed put until I ran into the kitchen behind Noel. But, that’s not really how I know who the murderer is.”\nBlake’s eyes continued to twinkle and a sly smile crossed Mary Beth’s face as Theresa continued, “Well, it wasn’t me. Noel was in the den with me right up until we heard Mary Beth scream. When I left her to get the washcloth, I went to the bathroom opposite the den. I never had opportunity to poison your drink. The same is true for Noel. He was busy making a call to Mary Beth’s sister during that short time that the den was empty before Blake returned.”\n“Now, as we work backwards, recall that you asked Juanita to join Roy upstairs to investigate the noise. Juanita ran from the room with her hands in front of her face, just like this was a real murder. Certainly, she could not have poisoned your drink. The same is true of Roy. He sat right by the den door and was never anywhere near you or your brandy snifter.”\nSmiling broadly now, Theresa looked at Mary Beth and gently chided her, saying, “shame on you for killing your husband! You ran out of the room and pretended to stumble on the table leg. The liquid splashed was not brandy from Blake’s snifter, but a small amount of the ‘poison’ you hurriedly slipped into it. I realize as I think this through that you are the only one who could have poisoned the drink.”\nBlake and Mary Beth laughed, saying, “Congratulations, Super Sleuth!” Playfully grabbing her husband and leading him to the mistletoe under the door, she tenderly kissed him. Softly, she added, “I’ve been mad enough to kill him a time or two!\nAn appreciative Blake returned his wife’s affection and added, “If this is the kiss of death, I’m more than ready for 2010!\nTheresa asked, “So, what’s the door prize?”\nMary Beth retrieved a thick leather bound volume of “The Complete Works of Miss Mary Jane Marple,” the female amateur detective that Agatha Christie had made famous. Handing it to Theresa, she said, “I’m glad one of you girls solved the murder. Miss Marple could not have done better!”"
