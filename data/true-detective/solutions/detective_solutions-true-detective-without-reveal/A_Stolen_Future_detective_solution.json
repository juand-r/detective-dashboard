    "full_text": "George Wilson slid his access card through the reader and entered the office. He walked past the rows of empty workstations and stopped at the desk of his assistant, Donna Blake. It was 6:30 in the morning and no one else had yet arrived. As was his routine, he asked for his messages and continued toward his office. Instead of entering his normal, tidy work area, he stumbled into a chaotic one where Mr. Wilson’s desk and chair were shoved up against the far wall with papers all over the floor. The safe was blown open and all its contents were missing; at least that’s the way George described it to me, Mike Murphy, the lead detective on the case. When I first arrived at the office suite, I phoned George’s assistant, Donna Blake, to gain access. There was a card reader at the main entrance that prevented unwanted visitors; a turnstile allowed only one person to enter with each card swipe. After her corporate office had remotely disabled the security system, Ms. Blake met me at the door and escorted me back to Mr. Wilson’s office. By the time I made it to the burgled safe, my team had already dusted for prints (none were found) and sent for a squad car to bring the company’s local IT manager in for questioning because he was the closest person the company had for a security expert. In the meantime, I sat down with George Wilson, the office manager. After he described what he found in the office this morning, I asked him to tell me what happened last night before the robbery. “Well, we had a big office party to celebrate the completion of our new computer chip. It represents a new technology that puts us miles ahead of the competition,” he explained. “Since it was just approved for production, I displayed the chip last night to our whole team, and we celebrated its pending release. We shut down just before midnight because I had to be in early today to prepare for a meeting.” He hesitated: “If our rivals get hold of that chip, we are sunk.” Mr. Wilson seemed to have genuine grievances, but I‘ve seen too many good actors in my day to prematurely bank on his honesty. The last time he saw the chip, he explained, was when he put it back in the safe at midnight; moreover, it was right after the party, and in front of several different witnesses who knew he had an early and busy day ahead of him. I next interviewed Ms. Blake, George’s assistant. She seemed friendly enough, but looked very tired. She told me that she had left with everyone else last night, and had returned around 6:00 a.m. to prepare several reports for Mr. Wilson’s teleconference, which was scheduled for this afternoon. She showed me the reports; the bags under her eyes coincided with the stack of papers she juggled in her arms. “I didn’t have time to go into his office today,” she said. “I had to fix a bunch of mistakes. My lack of sleep must be affecting my concentration because I keep putting tomorrow’s date on all his reports. Maybe I subconsciously want this day to end already,” she sarcastically huffed. “I don’t know why they aren’t automatically dated like they usually are. I suppose it’s some computer glitch.” “Who else has been in the office since the party last night?” “Only Mr. Wilson, me and ... the night janitor,” she recounted. “Someone had to clean up the mess we made with our celebration.” I asked an officer to go round up the janitor, a Mr. Pete Thompson. Next I talked to Jeffery Sharp, the computer tech. According to Donna Blake, he’s in charge of the office’s computer system. He looked just as tired as Ms. Blake; apparently, Jeffery had been working overtime lately, trying to wrap up the computer maintenance before he went on a two-week vacation, which started today. Mr. Sharp seemed agitated from the start: “Look, I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but my plane leaves in less than three hours,” he spat. “And I was up all night packing.” “I’ll do my best to get you there on time.” I replied with as much diplomacy as I could muster. “Where is it that you’re headed?” “Aruba.” He answered. “With beautiful beaches, and, best of all, no computers!” “Can you can get me a printout of everyone that has been in this office since the party last night?” I asked. Without answering, he led me over to his workstation, wiped the sleep from his eyes, and began to type. Soon he handed me a printout of a very short list; it showed that only two people had entered the office that morning: Ms. Blake at 6:10 and Mr. Wilson at 6:25. “You can see I wasn’t here after the party. “Send me on my way,” he pleaded. “Let’s get all the facts, and then you can go. Stick around for a bit and we’ll wrap this up.” I said as I exited to question the last suspect. Pete Thompson, the janitor, puzzled me the most, especially because there was no record of him using the access card last night. He said he had come in at 1:00 a.m. to clean up after the party, and that he had left around 4:00 a.m. for his next shift at another location, which ended at 5:30 a.m. He had just gone to bed when the officer arrived to get him. A quick call to Pete’s second job confirmed that he had indeed arrived there at 4:00 this morning. And, from the disheveled description of the office, three hours seemed to be an appropriate estimate of time it would take to clean up. On top of that, I figure it would take at least an hour to break in to the safe. Where would Pete have found the time? I decided to make a call to the chip manufacturer’s corporate offices. Mr. Connelly, the head of security, could not explain how the janitor had entered the building without using his card. If there had been a system malfunction, he assured me that the system would simply shut down all access. I also asked him if someone in Jeffery’s position would be able to tamper with the system. Mr. Connelly said that very limited access is granted to an employee in Jeffery’s position; however, he could adjust the system to synchronize with events like daylight savings and leap years because the company’s security system is directly linked to the rest of their computer system. Jeffery couldn’t have shut the system off without also shutting off all entry — or exit. When I returned to the crime scene, I saw Jeffery complaining that he now only had two hours to make his flight. He waved his tickets around and threw them down on top of the “office access” printout he had given me earlier. I looked at his tickets and the printout again. I told Jeffery he should first meet me in the conference room — before he took to Aruba — so I could explain to him what had happened to the computer chip.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive\n   •  George Wilson – losing the chip ruins him, not helps him.  No motive.  \n   •  Donna Blake – no obvious gain, and she needs the chip for the reports she is preparing.  \n   •  Pete Thompson – a night-shift janitor is the least likely buyer or user of a state-of-the-art micro-chip.  No clear motive.  \n   •  Jeffery Sharp – about to disappear on a long holiday, obviously needs money, and his skill-set is exactly what a competitor would want from an inside thief.  He is the only person who could quickly sell or smuggle the chip out of the country.\n\n2.  Opportunity\n   •  The room was entered and the safe blown sometime between midnight (when Wilson locked it) and 6:10 a.m. (Blake’s arrival).  \n   •  Thompson was verifiably cleaning from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m.; an hour or more would have been needed to blow the safe in addition to the three hours of cleaning – impossible for him.  \n   •  Wilson went home and was first seen again at 6:25.  \n   •  Blake went home with everyone else and came back at 6:10.  \n   •  Sharp never proved he left the building after the party.  He could simply have stayed behind, robbed the safe, walked out through the free-exit turnstile (no card swipe needed) and then driven home to “pack.”  He is the only one with undisputed, unsupervised access to the place for the whole interval.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / alibis\n   •  No fingerprints – the thief wore gloves.  \n   •  Thompson’s card never appears in the access computer, yet we know from the other office that he was at work elsewhere at 4 a.m.; therefore the access computer’s clock or log has been altered.  \n   •  Blake’s computer suddenly stops auto-dating her documents and keeps showing tomorrow’s date – evidence the whole network clock is advanced one day.  \n   •  Corporate security says only an employee with Jeffery’s privileges can change the date/time (they need that right for daylight-saving and leap-year corrections).  Wilson, Blake and Thompson cannot do that.  \n   •  The detective notices that Jeffery’s airline tickets are dated “today,” while the access-log print-out Jeffery just produced is time-stamped “tomorrow.”  That proves the system clock has been moved forward exactly one day – something only Jeffery could have done.\n\n4.  Logical deduction\n   •  Moving the system clock forward hides the real time-stamps: everyone who entered between midnight and 6 a.m. is now listed under the “wrong” day, so they do not appear in “today’s” report.  \n   •  That conveniently removes Jeffery’s own card swipe after the party (and shows no janitor entry) while still allowing Blake’s and Wilson’s perfectly innocent swipes to appear later, once Jeffery reset the clock to the real time before leaving.  \n   •  Therefore the only person who both BENEFITS from a falsified clock and has the ABILITY to falsify it is Jeffery Sharp.  \n   •  With motive, opportunity, means and an altered security log pointing straight at him, he must be the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGeorge Wilson, Donna Blake, Pete Thompson, Jeffery Sharp\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJeffery Sharp\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Roughly 11:55 p.m. – The party ends.  Everyone heads out; Jeffery tells people he has “maintenance” to do and remains inside.  \n•  12:00 a.m. – Wilson locks the prototype chip in the safe and leaves.  \n•  12:10 a.m. – Jeffery, alone, uses his system privileges to advance the entire network/security clock by ONE DAY.  From this moment on, all swipes will be stored under tomorrow’s date.  \n•  12:15–12:45 a.m. – Jeffery forces the safe (gloves, small charge) and removes the chip, scattering papers to fake a violent burglary.  \n•  1:00 a.m. – Janitor Pete Thompson arrives, swipes in (recorded as “1:00 a.m. tomorrow”) and spends three hours cleaning, never approaching the office.  \n•  3:00 a.m. – Jeffery exits through the one-way turnstile (no swipe required) and drives home to pack.  \n•  4:00 a.m. – Thompson leaves for his next job; his swipe out, again, is stored under the wrong date.  \n•  5:00 a.m. – From home, Jeffery resets the system clock to the correct time so the office will function normally when people arrive, but the mis-dated swipes remain in the database under tomorrow.  \n•  6:10 a.m. – Donna Blake arrives (first entry recorded with the CORRECT date).  Her PC, however, takes its date from the main server, which has just jumped backward a day: auto-dating fails, and she keeps seeing “tomorrow” on her screen.  \n•  6:25 a.m. – Wilson discovers the burglary.  \n•  8:00 a.m. – Detective Murphy asks for an entry log “since the party last night.”  Jeffery, knowing the police do not suspect the clock tampering, simply prints TODAY’s log – which now shows only Blake and Wilson.  He thinks he is in the clear.  \n•  The detective compares the log’s “tomorrow” date-stamp to Sharp’s airline tickets dated “today,” realizes the clock was deliberately moved, and arrests Jeffery before he can fly to Aruba with the stolen chip.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  George Wilson – had no financial interest in destroying his own project and was not in the building during the crucial hours; his early-morning arrival is logged legitimately.  \n•  Donna Blake – likewise logged, and her struggles with the wrong computer date are evidence, not guilt.  She had no time to blow open a safe or alter the network clock.  \n•  Pete Thompson – his alibi is confirmed by his second employer.  The only reason his swipe is “missing” is the altered system clock; he lacks both the motive and the technical skill to perform that alteration.  \nOnly Jeffery Sharp had the motive, the knowledge and the chance to falsify the security records, steal the chip and try to disappear overseas.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Before going into the conference room, I asked Donna to print out the “office access” report for the last two days. I then asked her to report on what she found. She said the reports showed some confusing information. The day of the party showed, impossibly, that only two people entered the office for the entire day: First, Pete, at 1:07 a.m., and then Jeffery, at 4:15 a.m. It was blank after that. She also said that, just like on her morning reports, the dates were wrong: The one with Pete and Jeffery was dated today, and the one with her and Mr. Wilson was actually dated tomorrow.\nI explained that, since the security system would shut down office access if anyone local tried to turn it off, the thief had to find another way around it. Jeffery Sharp had been granted access to one small, but important, part of the security system: When he changes the date in the office’s computer system, it also changes it in the security system. So to hide his theft, the night he cracked the safe, he moved the date forward one day the night. He obviously hoped that no one would notice until he was safely out of the country.\nFor me, it all came together when I saw that the date on Jeffery’s tickets didn’t match the date on the access report for the day of the robbery.",

She told me that she had left with everyone else last night, and had returned around 6:00 a.m. to prepare several reports for Mr. Wilson’s teleconference, which was scheduled for this afternoon. She showed me the reports; the bags under her eyes coincided with the stack of papers she juggled in her arms. “I didn’t have time to go into his office today,” she said. “I had to fix a bunch of mistakes. My lack of sleep must be affecting my concentration because I keep putting tomorrow’s date on all his reports. Maybe I subconsciously want this day to end already,” she sarcastically huffed. “I don’t know why they aren’t automatically dated like they usually are. I suppose it’s some computer glitch.” “Who else has been in the office since the party last night?” “Only Mr. Wilson, me and ... the night janitor,” she recounted. “Someone had to clean up the mess we made with our celebration.” I asked an officer to go round up the janitor, a Mr. Pete Thompson. Next I talked to Jeffery Sharp, the computer tech. According to Donna Blake, he’s in charge of the office’s computer system. He looked just as tired as Ms. Blake; apparently, Jeffery had been working overtime lately, trying to wrap up the computer maintenance before he went on a two-week vacation, which started today. Mr. Sharp seemed agitated from the start: “Look, I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but my plane leaves in less than three hours,” he spat. “And I was up all night packing.” “I’ll do my best to get you there on time.” I replied with as much diplomacy as I could muster. “Where is it that you’re headed?” “Aruba.” He answered. “With beautiful beaches, and, best of all, no computers!” “Can you can get me a printout of everyone that has been in this office since the party last night?” I asked. Without answering, he led me over to his workstation, wiped the sleep from his eyes, and began to type. Soon he handed me a printout of a very short list; it showed that only two people had entered the office that morning: Ms. Blake at 6:10 and Mr. Wilson at 6:25. “You can see I wasn’t here after the party. “Send me on my way,” he pleaded. “Let’s get all the facts, and then you can go. Stick around for a bit and we’ll wrap this up.” I said as I exited to question the last suspect. Pete Thompson, the janitor, puzzled me the most, especially because there was no record of him using the access card last night. He said he had come in at 1:00 a.m. to clean up after the party, and that he had left around 4:00 a.m. for his next shift at another location, which ended at 5:30 a.m. He had just gone to bed when the officer arrived to get him. A quick call to Pete’s second job confirmed that he had indeed arrived there at 4:00 this morning. And, from the disheveled description of the office, three hours seemed to be an appropriate estimate of time it would take to clean up. On top of that, I figure it would take at least an hour to break in to the safe. Where would Pete have found the time? I decided to make a call to the chip manufacturer’s corporate offices. Mr. Connelly, the head of security, could not explain how the janitor had entered the building without using his card. If there had been a system malfunction, he assured me that the system would simply shut down all access. I also asked him if someone in Jeffery’s position would be able to tamper with the system. Mr. Connelly said that very limited access is granted to an employee in Jeffery’s position; however, he could adjust the system to synchronize with events like daylight savings and leap years because the company’s security system is directly linked to the rest of their computer system. Jeffery couldn’t have shut the system off without also shutting off all entry — or exit. When I returned to the crime scene, I saw Jeffery complaining that he now only had two hours to make his flight. He waved his tickets around and threw them down on top of the “office access” printout he had given me earlier. I looked at his tickets and the printout again. I told Jeffery he should first meet me in the conference room — before he took to Aruba — so I could explain to him what had happened to the computer chip.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Donna Blake; (b) George Wilson; (c) Jeffery Sharp; (d) Pete Thompson",
      "answer": "(c) Jeffery Sharp",
      "outcome": "Before going into the conference room, I asked Donna to print out the “office access” report for the last two days. I then asked her to report on what she found. She said the reports showed some confusing information. The day of the party showed, impossibly, that only two people entered the office for the entire day: First, Pete, at 1:07 a.m., and then Jeffery, at 4:15 a.m. It was blank after that. She also said that, just like on her morning reports, the dates were wrong: The one with Pete and Jeffery was dated today, and the one with her and Mr. Wilson was actually dated tomorrow.\nI explained that, since the security system would shut down office access if anyone local tried to turn it off, the thief had to find another way around it. Jeffery Sharp had been granted access to one small, but important, part of the security system: When he changes the date in the office’s computer system, it also changes it in the security system. So to hide his theft, the night he cracked the safe, he moved the date forward one day the night. He obviously hoped that no one would notice until he was safely out of the country.\nFor me, it all came together when I saw that the date on Jeffery’s tickets didn’t match the date on the access report for the day of the robbery."
