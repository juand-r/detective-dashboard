    "full_text": "The Fall Festival was always a big thing in Chagrin Falls the weekend of Thanksgiving. Friday and Saturday featured important events for many of the high school sports teams. Specifically, the last football game was scheduled on Friday night, and the Chagrin Invitational Wrestling Tournament was held on Friday and Saturday. Though, all games and competitions ended by 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. Everyone -- parents and kids alike -- needed time to prepare for the big Fall Festival Dance, held Saturday night. While mothers are well known for being incredibly sentimental as their children grow up, the truth is that fathers are just as emotional. Sure, we may not want to talk about our feelings out loud. And we certainly don’t get all giddy as our children get dressed up for special occasions. But, inside, we secretly take great pride in seeing the amazing young adults that our children are becoming. In fact, that was exactly what I was thinking while I watched a pack of gushy mothers take picture after picture of our children as they were about to head to dinner, before the big dance. (That, plus how I was going to get a digital copy of those pictures.) As the kids got into the limo, I thought what an amazing evening my son, RJ, had ahead of him. He was with Diane, a girl he really liked. And it was apparent that she really liked him, too. Diane had worked miracles for my son’s health and eating habits. He had always had a huge sweet tooth, but since Diane was a diabetic who could not eat sweets, he had stopped eating them as well in support of her. RJ and Diane were going to the dance with three other couples. This was their first formal dance and the parents had spared no expense. We had rented them a limo so that they did not have to be driven by parents. The children planned to go to a nice dinner prior to the dance. The boys had even taken dance classes in order to surprise the girls with their newfound rhythm. I had no idea how the football coach had gotten the entire team to agree to it, but something told me it had a lot to do with a choice between dance lessons or lots and lots of extra laps at practice. Even more amazing was that, as far as I knew, the entire team had managed to keep it a secret from the girls. Fortunately for me, I was one of the lucky parents picked to be a chaperone. The dance went from 9:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m., and I had the first shift, from nine o’clock to eleven. I got there early so that I could watch the couples arrive. Principal Whittenmeyer cornered me as I walked in the door. Each year, he made the punch for the event. He was so proud of his “secret formula” (and no one had the heart to tell him that we all knew that it was just Kool-Aid). As I walked in the door, he relayed that this year, he planned to give every student a Breathalyzer to test for alcohol, before they were allowed to enter the dance. I thought that was a great idea, especially because that meant that he would be guarding the door all night. That meant that I was not going to have to talk to him all night. He then pointed me towards the punch and watched as I sipped from the plastic cup. I smiled and gave him a reassuring thumbs-up. (Yes, it was Kool-Aid again this year.) I took my cup and moved to the other side of the gym to watch as everyone arrived. It was fun to observe this great occasion, as all of the children I had known since they were in kindergarten came in dressed up for their first formal event. One of the first students to arrive was Carole. Carole had always been one of my favorite kids. However, for some reason, Carole could never seem to get a date. This night, she arrived at the dance by herself. While most of the girls with dates were arriving without coats, Carole had worn one. When she took her coat off near the punchbowl, I was very pleased to see that even though she had no date, she had still taken great care to dress up for the dance. Since she and RJ had been friends for years, I hoped that RJ would ask her to dance at least one dance during the night. And let me tell you, I almost had a heart attack when I saw Dan OKane. Dan was a junior who was nationally ranked as a wrestler. Like every other year, he dropped as much weight as he could in order to get into the lowest possible weight class. This was the first time I had ever seen him in anything other than a sweat suit during wrestling season. He lived in one of those plastic suits that allowed athletes to sweat constantly. Yet, here he was in a suit and tie, looking smashing. I bet his parents were really proud of him. As was his nature to be helpful, Dan was constantly getting punch for everyone and he spent a lot of time by the punch bowl talking to his friends. That was when RJ and his group finally arrived. They obviously had a wonderful time at dinner as they were all laughing and smiling when they arrived. After passing through the breath test, they were all directed by Principal Whittenmeyer to the punch bowl. Soon after that, I saw Diane passing out punch to everyone. I did my best to play it cool and not go over and talk with all of the kids I knew. Fortunately, many of them stopped over during the night to say a quick hello. Even RJ stopped by about an hour into the dance. He was standing there talking to me when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his stomach. It seemed as if he had eaten something that did not agree with him. I started to ask what he had for dinner when I noticed that most of the students were also clutching their stomachs in pain. As I looked around the room, it quickly became apparent that there were only five people who were unaffected and I was one of them. Dan quickly walked away from the punch bowl and headed over to where I was, stopping to get Carole and Diane on the way. There were three of the four other unaffected people. Principal Whittenmeyer, the last healthy person, saw everyone converging on me and walked over as well. Very quickly we realized that someone had spiked the punch. Since I had been the first one to have some and I had not gotten sick, it certainly looked as if I had done something to the punch to make everyone sick. Before anyone did anything foolish, I pulled out my cell phone and called 911. As the paramedics were taking care of everyone, the police arrived to question everyone. I walked up to the police and told them that I already knew who had spiked the punch bowl.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Chronology of the punch  \n   • Principal Whittenmeyer makes the punch and has the narrator taste it before any students arrive – the narrator feels fine later, so the punch was harmless at that moment.  \n   • A few minutes later Carole appears alone, wearing the only coat seen that evening, and she takes that coat off directly beside the punch-bowl.  \n   • Shortly afterward Dan O’Kane drifts over to the table and begins ladling out punch for others.  \n   • Then the big group containing RJ and Diane arrives; Diane begins handing cups of punch around.  \n   • Within an hour almost every student who drank the punch is doubled over with stomach cramps.\n\n   Therefore the contaminant had to be added after the narrator’s safe sample but before the bulk of the students were served.  Carole and Dan are the only people who had that window of opportunity.\n\n2.  Who stayed healthy – and why  \n   • Narrator  …drank before the bowl was tainted.  \n   • Principal  …was stationed at the door all night and never drank.  \n   • Diane   …is diabetic and never touches sweet drinks.  \n   • Dan   …is cutting weight for wrestling and therefore avoids sugary drinks.  \n   • Carole  …has no dietary or athletic reason to refuse punch—yet she never becomes ill.\n\n   Four of the five healthy people have an obvious, external reason not to drink.  Carole is the odd one out; the only explanation for her deliberately avoiding the punch is that she knew it had been doctored.\n\n3.  Motive  \n   Carole arrived dateless at the first formal dance of high-school life, forced to watch every other girl enjoying the evening.  Jealousy—or simple malicious mischief—explains why she would want to ruin the night for everyone else.  Her coat gave her the perfect place to conceal a bottle of ipecac or another fast-acting gastrointestinal irritant.\n\n4.  Opportunity and behaviour  \n   • She alone had a coat big enough to hide a bottle.  \n   • She was the very first student to stand next to the unattended punch.  \n   • She remained healthy yet had no logical reason to have avoided the drink.  \n   • After the mass illness began, Dan had to go and fetch her—she was not already at the punch table getting herself another drink, because she had no intention of drinking any.\n\n5.  Conclusion  \n   Only Carole both possessed the opportunity (the key time-window) and lacked a legitimate reason for refusing the punch.  That is why the narrator could tell the police, almost immediately, who had spiked it.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCarole, Dan O’Kane, Diane, Principal Whittenmeyer, Narrator-father\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCarole\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Principal Whittenmeyer mixes ordinary Kool-Aid in the afternoon.  \n• Shortly before 9 p.m. the narrator tastes the perfectly safe punch.  \n• A little later Carole arrives alone.  With no eyes on her and her coat shielding the action, she empties a vial of ipecac/laxative into the bowl, gives it a quick stir with the ladle, hangs up her coat and moves away.  \n• Dan O’Kane soon comes over.  Oblivious to what was done, he begins serving cups but (because of his weight-cut) drinks none himself.  \n• RJ’s group reaches the table next; Diane, helping out, hands the now-tainted punch around.  \n• Over the next hour nearly every student who drank it develops severe stomach cramps.  \n• Because the narrator’s sample pre-dated the poisoning—and the Principal, Diane, and Dan all abstain for obvious reasons—only Carole’s immunity is unexplained, pointing straight at her guilt.  \n• The narrator realises this chain of facts and tells the arriving police that Carole must be the one who spiked the punch.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nPrincipal Whittenmeyer – He was stationed at the entrance administering breath tests the entire time; eyewitnesses (including every arriving student) confirm he never left the doorway.  \nDan O’Kane – Had constant access but also a rock-solid reason not to drink sugar; his being healthy is therefore unsurprising, and several students saw him draw punch only after Carole had been at the table.  \nDiane – Handled cups, not the bowl, and abstained because of diabetes; moreover she arrived with RJ’s group, after the punch had already been doctored.  \nNarrator-father – Drank first; had no chance to add anything afterward without being seen; became the initial “taste-tester” proving the punch was still clean.  \nAll of them have clear, independent reasons for escaping the mass illness, unlike Carole, whose unexplained good health exposes her as the perpetrator.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

As I looked around the room, it quickly became apparent that there were only five people who were unaffected and I was one of them. Dan quickly walked away from the punch bowl and headed over to where I was, stopping to get Carole and Diane on the way. There were three of the four other unaffected people. Principal Whittenmeyer, the last healthy person, saw everyone converging on me and walked over as well. Very quickly we realized that someone had spiked the punch. Since I had been the first one to have some and I had not gotten sick, it certainly looked as if I had done something to the punch to make everyone sick. Before anyone did anything foolish, I pulled out my cell phone and called 911. As the paramedics were taking care of everyone, the police arrived to question everyone. I walked up to the police and told them that I already knew who had spiked the punch bowl.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Carole; (b) Dan; (c) Diane; (d) Principal Whittenmeyer",
      "answer": "(a) Carole",
      "outcome": "The police asked if I had been watching the punch bowl all night. I assured them that while I had not been watching the punch bowl, I was aware of some other things. First of all, the punch was not spiked when I arrived -- I was not sick. And since Principal Whittenmeyer had not left the door since I arrived, he would not have had a chance to spike it.\nAs for myself, I had been across the room all evening. The issue was who else had not had punch and why had they not had any of it. Diane did not drink any punch because she is a diabetic and would not have had any of the sugary punch. Dan, meanwhile, is a wrestler who is trying to lose weight. Like Diane, he would not drink a sugary drink when he is trying to lose weight.\nCarole, however, had no reason not to drink the punch. In addition, she had a coat on that she wore over to the punch table. She could easily have hidden the poison in her coat and spiked the punch when she got there."
