    "full_text": "Melody Kairns was usually the first person out of bed in the mornings. However, on this cool, spring morning in Oklahoma, she was still in bed at nine. All others in the Kairns household slept late that day, so they would say, and did not notice Melody’s absence from the kitchen until Nancy, the last person to arise, voiced her concern. It fell to Vernon, Melody’s husband of twenty-four years, to return to the bedroom and check on his wife. He found Melody, a handsome woman of forty-four years, dead and mostly unmarked. The only noticeable evidence of foul play was a small, round head wound near her temple, crusted over with a small amount of dried blood. She looked like she was peacefully asleep, which Vernon considered was quite unlike her, as she was usually a noisy, restless sleeper. Vernon, before allowing himself to go into panic, felt her cold wrist. There was no pulse—it was evident she had been dead for several hours. The coroner would later say that she had been dead for approximately seven hours, placing the murder at sometime around two in the morning. Mercifully, the murder weapon, later discovered to be an ice pick, missing from the kitchen, killed her quickly. There was no blood on Melody’s body or bed sheets. But the case stumped the family and police. Several weeks passed, and spring gave way to a hot summer. Vernon invited his sister-in-law Constance, a widow who lived in Texas, to visit for the first time since her sister had been murdered. Constance had been vacationing, staying with the Kairns family, the week that her sister died. She was nearly inconsolable, and Vernon sent her home soon after Melody’s funeral. Constance had little use for Vernon, whom she suspected of womanizing and felt didn’t apply himself to his career and family as he should, but she appreciated the chance to see her niece and nephew again, her last connections to her sister. She and Melody had been close when they were children, even with a seven-year age difference. They had shared a bedroom in their family’s small, east Texas farmhouse when growing up, and also shared all of their hopes, dreams and secrets. Constance recalled those days with fondness but did not entirely miss them, for Melody suffered lifelong sinus trouble and snored loudly, making sound sleep impossible for her until the day she was murdered. That Constance had extremely sensitive hearing only made matters worse, as she, too, experienced lifelong sleeping problems. Still, they had been more than sisters; they were soul mates. Melody’s death had been extremely hard on her. The morning she arrived, just after breakfast, Vernon gathered all of the family into the spacious den. It was the first time since that horrible day they had all been together in one room. After a few minutes of awkward small talk, Vernon cleared his throat and stated, “One of us murdered Melody.” He could barely utter the words and hated what the children must be thinking and going through. But, the police were stumped by the case, and it was apparent that they would get nowhere in the investigation unless one of the family remembered a detail about the night they’d previously forgotten. Vernon explained that the police had encouraged him to bring them together to talk about Melody’s murder again, with Constance present this time. He was not really confident any of them would remember something previously overlooked, but wanted to give it a try. He then asked, “Did anyone see or hear anything out of the ordinary the night she died?” The Kairns house was a big two story and well insulated. Sound did not carry well in it and Vernon was not surprised when nobody replied in the affirmative. John said, “I came home around midnight; I had been out with friends. All the lights were out and I assumed everyone was in bed. I went to the den and watched TV. It must have been three or so before I went upstairs to bed.” Nancy offered, “I was on the phone in my room, with the door closed. Beth and I didn’t quit talking until two-thirty or so.” Nancy gave her father a guilty look, as she knew he disapproved of her late night calls with her talkative best friend Beth Jameson. Vernon then turned to Constance. Barely hiding his animosity, he asked, “And what about you?” Constance smiled thinly, and answered, “I went to bed before midnight and didn’t see or talk to anyone again until next morning. She paused, and then said to John, “I thought about coming downstairs to watch television with you, but I could tell that you were watching one of those Friday the 13th-type movies. You all know how I hate violence with guns and knives.” Turning to Vernon, she said, “I didn’t hear anything from your room all night long.” Constance and Vernon looked at each other. Icily, she asked, “So what about you?” Vernon replied, “I went to bed at eleven-thirty. I vaguely recall hearing John come in downstairs as I was drifting off to a deep sleep. That’s the last thing I remember before awaking the next morning.” He shook, and his voice cracked when saying, “I didn’t notice anything wrong when I got up. I’m always groggy before morning coffee.” Nancy asked her father, “You don’t really believe John or I killed Mom, do you? She nervously glanced at Constance and said, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you killed Mom.” Nancy’s cheeks were rosy red from embarrassment. Constance answered, softly, “Don’t worry about it, dear. I know what you are going through.” Vernon appreciated his sister-in-law’s gentling handling of his troubled daughter, but that did not stop him from saying, “You are the only one who cannot account for your presence during the window of time Melody … left us.” He could not bring himself to use the word “murder” again. Constance thought a long moment, sadness washing over her as she looked at Vernon and Melody’s sweet children. Before speaking, she silently cursed, “Oh, how I hate it’s come to this!” But then she spoke, saying to all of them, “No, I cannot account for my time. I don’t have to because it doesn’t make any difference. The game is up.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Background facts that matter  \n   –  Melody was an inveterate, LOUD snorer.  Everyone who had ever slept near her (especially her sister Constance) was well aware of it.  \n   –  The house is large and well-insulated; ordinarily very little sound travels from one room to another.  If, in spite of the insulation, someone upstairs can tell what programme is on the television downstairs, that person must be in the hall, on the stairs or in the den rather than in bed behind a closed door.  \n   –  The death-blow was a single puncture to the temple with an ice-pick taken from the kitchen.  One stab, very little blood, death almost instantaneous.  \n   –  Coroners estimate time of death from body temperature; an air-conditioned bedroom, a thin forty-four-year-old woman and a sleepless, cool spring night can make the estimate stray by a couple of hours either way.\n\n2.  Establishing the real time of death  \n   –  Constance “went to bed before midnight.”  \n   –  Constance has “extremely sensitive hearing” and had always been kept awake by Melody’s snoring.  \n   –  When asked what she had heard that night she says, pointedly, “I didn’t hear ANYTHING from your room ALL night long.”  \n   If Melody had been alive after Constance retired, Constance would inevitably have heard the snoring.  The total absence of snoring means Melody was already dead before Constance went to bed – in other words, before midnight.  \n   The coroner’s ±2 h estimate of 2 a.m. therefore runs late; the real death-time must have been around 11:00-11:30 p.m.\n\n3.  Narrowing the field by opportunity  \n   –  John was not even in the house until a little after midnight: too late.  \n   –  Nancy was on the telephone in her room until 2:30 a.m.: also after the actual murder.  \n   –  Constance was still downstairs shortly before midnight (she could tell – actually she had SEEN – that John was watching a slasher film); but she had no reason to enter Melody’s bedroom before going upstairs, and there is nothing to place her in or near the kitchen for the ice-pick before midnight.  \n   –  Vernon, on the other hand, says he and Melody went to bed at 11:30 p.m.  He was the only person alone with her in the right time-window, the only person who would not have had to creep past other family members and risk being seen.\n\n4.  Vernon’s slips  \n   –  He claims to have “heard John come in downstairs” as he was “drifting off to a deep sleep.”  Anyone who has shared a bed with a champion snorer knows you don’t drift off to sleep AFTER the snorer – the snorer usually keeps you awake.  \n   –  He never once mentions Melody’s snoring that night, although he calls her a “noisy, restless sleeper”.  He fails to notice the very thing that is most characteristic of her in bed – because the noise had already stopped.  \n   –  By announcing, “You are the ONLY one who cannot account for your time,” he tries to focus suspicion on Constance even though he himself can give no better alibi than “I was asleep.”  Classic deflection.\n\n5.  Motive  \n   The story hints Vernon had been “womanising” and “didn’t apply himself to his career and family.”  Melody, first up every morning, may have been the household’s moral engine.  Vernon’s motives could be freedom, resentment, another woman, or simply long-boiling marital friction.  Whatever the precise motive, he had far more to gain than the children, and far less affection toward Melody than Constance.\n\n6.  The clincher  \n   The absence of the one unmistakable sound (Melody’s snoring) from the very start of the night pins the time of death solidly in the short interval between Melody’s retiring and Constance’s going upstairs.  Only Vernon was alone with her then, and only Vernon had to produce an alibi that boils down to “trust me, I was asleep.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nVernon Kairns, Constance (Kairns) ?, John Kairns, Nancy Kairns\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nVernon Kairns\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly after 11 p.m. Melody and Vernon went upstairs.  Melody, exhausted from spring allergies, fell asleep almost at once and began her usual loud snoring.  Vernon, fed up with his wife, fetched the ice-pick from the kitchen, returned to the bedroom and, with a single thrust to the temple, killed her.  He wiped the pick clean and hid it, slipped back into bed and waited.  The cool night air and the house air-conditioning slowed the cooling-rate calculation and misled the coroner by two to three hours.\n\nAround midnight John came home; Vernon, lying awake, heard him and later used that fact as part of his story.  Constance, still downstairs, glanced into the den, saw John’s slasher film and went up to bed.  Normally she would have been kept awake by her sister’s snoring, but the house was eerily silent – Melody was already dead.  Wondering but too polite to disturb anyone, Constance eventually slept.\n\nNext morning everyone “overslept.”  When Nancy remarked that her mother had not appeared, Vernon “discovered” the body, played the shocked husband and steered the investigation away from himself.  Months later, hoping to push the lingering police suspicion on to Constance, he staged the family meeting.  Unfortunately for him, Constance’s simple observation – there had been no snoring at all that night – destroyed the coroner’s timetable and placed the murder squarely in Vernon’s hands.  Realising this, Constance ended the discussion with, “The game is up.”\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJohn Kairns – did not arrive home until after the real time of death and was downstairs the rest of the night.  To reach the bedroom he would have had to pass his father’s open door and risk being seen.\n\nNancy Kairns – was in her room on the telephone until 2:30 a.m., long after Melody was already dead, and likewise would have had to pass her parents’ room.\n\nConstance – her remark about hearing nothing from the bedroom all night is only possible if Melody was already dead before she went upstairs.  That places the murder before midnight, while Constance was still downstairs and before she had any occasion (or weapon) to enter the bedroom.  Moreover, she had every reason to love her sister and no apparent motive to kill her.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The murderer sat, surprised and shocked, in the big easy chair. The family sat motionless, hanging on the Constance’s every word.\nShe continued, “I have been so depressed since the killing that I have not been able to think straight. But, after listening to everyone this morning, the blinders lifted.”\n“Melody died around two that terrible night; I should say, early morning.” Turning to John, she said, “You could not have killed your mother. Everyone here is aware that I hear better than most people, and I know you were watching television downstairs until a few minutes after three. You could not have been downstairs watching television and upstairs committing murder at the same time.”\nNancy was agitated and near tears, so Constance addressed her next. “It wasn’t you either, sweetheart. It will be easy enough for your friend Beth, and the telephone company, if need be, to verify you were talking on the telephone. I’m certain you would not have heard or paid any attention to unfamiliar noises when deep into conversation with Beth.” The speaker offered a warm, comforting smile and this settled Nancy back into a stony, but calm, silence.\nConstance turned and addressed Vernon. “Remember I said I do not have to account for my time because it doesn’t make any difference?” Vernon, in shock, barely nodded, but he understood what was being said. Constance continued, “That I was in my room alone all night with nobody to confirm it doesn’t make any difference because I know you killed Melody.” Pausing, she said, “I should say; you and the children are well aware of my fear of guns and knives.” Her voice began to break but she continued, “Do you really think I would kill my sister with an ice pick?” Staring intensely at him she went on, “You forgot that we grew up and slept in the same bedroom. Melody never had a sound night’s sleep in her life and makes more noise than a freight train.”\nVernon replied, weakly, “So what?”\nConstance could not bear to look at him any longer. “Do you really expect me to believe that you were alert enough to hear your son come in downstairs, in a house that does not carry sounds well, but you noticed nothing unusual with the restless sleeper lying right beside you all night long?”",

Sound did not carry well in it and Vernon was not surprised when nobody replied in the affirmative. John said, “I came home around midnight; I had been out with friends. All the lights were out and I assumed everyone was in bed. I went to the den and watched TV. It must have been three or so before I went upstairs to bed.” Nancy offered, “I was on the phone in my room, with the door closed. Beth and I didn’t quit talking until two-thirty or so.” Nancy gave her father a guilty look, as she knew he disapproved of her late night calls with her talkative best friend Beth Jameson. Vernon then turned to Constance. Barely hiding his animosity, he asked, “And what about you?” Constance smiled thinly, and answered, “I went to bed before midnight and didn’t see or talk to anyone again until next morning. She paused, and then said to John, “I thought about coming downstairs to watch television with you, but I could tell that you were watching one of those Friday the 13th-type movies. You all know how I hate violence with guns and knives.” Turning to Vernon, she said, “I didn’t hear anything from your room all night long.” Constance and Vernon looked at each other. Icily, she asked, “So what about you?” Vernon replied, “I went to bed at eleven-thirty. I vaguely recall hearing John come in downstairs as I was drifting off to a deep sleep. That’s the last thing I remember before awaking the next morning.” He shook, and his voice cracked when saying, “I didn’t notice anything wrong when I got up. I’m always groggy before morning coffee.” Nancy asked her father, “You don’t really believe John or I killed Mom, do you? She nervously glanced at Constance and said, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you killed Mom.” Nancy’s cheeks were rosy red from embarrassment. Constance answered, softly, “Don’t worry about it, dear. I know what you are going through.” Vernon appreciated his sister-in-law’s gentling handling of his troubled daughter, but that did not stop him from saying, “You are the only one who cannot account for your presence during the window of time Melody … left us.” He could not bring himself to use the word “murder” again. Constance thought a long moment, sadness washing over her as she looked at Vernon and Melody’s sweet children. Before speaking, she silently cursed, “Oh, how I hate it’s come to this!” But then she spoke, saying to all of them, “No, I cannot account for my time. I don’t have to because it doesn’t make any difference. The game is up.”",

      "answer": "(d) Vernon",
      "outcome": "The murderer sat, surprised and shocked, in the big easy chair. The family sat motionless, hanging on the Constance’s every word.\nShe continued, “I have been so depressed since the killing that I have not been able to think straight. But, after listening to everyone this morning, the blinders lifted.”\n“Melody died around two that terrible night; I should say, early morning.” Turning to John, she said, “You could not have killed your mother. Everyone here is aware that I hear better than most people, and I know you were watching television downstairs until a few minutes after three. You could not have been downstairs watching television and upstairs committing murder at the same time.”\nNancy was agitated and near tears, so Constance addressed her next. “It wasn’t you either, sweetheart. It will be easy enough for your friend Beth, and the telephone company, if need be, to verify you were talking on the telephone. I’m certain you would not have heard or paid any attention to unfamiliar noises when deep into conversation with Beth.” The speaker offered a warm, comforting smile and this settled Nancy back into a stony, but calm, silence.\nConstance turned and addressed Vernon. “Remember I said I do not have to account for my time because it doesn’t make any difference?” Vernon, in shock, barely nodded, but he understood what was being said. Constance continued, “That I was in my room alone all night with nobody to confirm it doesn’t make any difference because I know you killed Melody.” Pausing, she said, “I should say; you and the children are well aware of my fear of guns and knives.” Her voice began to break but she continued, “Do you really think I would kill my sister with an ice pick?” Staring intensely at him she went on, “You forgot that we grew up and slept in the same bedroom. Melody never had a sound night’s sleep in her life and makes more noise than a freight train.”\nVernon replied, weakly, “So what?”\nConstance could not bear to look at him any longer. “Do you really expect me to believe that you were alert enough to hear your son come in downstairs, in a house that does not carry sounds well, but you noticed nothing unusual with the restless sleeper lying right beside you all night long?”"
