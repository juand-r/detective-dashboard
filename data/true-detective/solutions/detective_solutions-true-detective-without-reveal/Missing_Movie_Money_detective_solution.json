    "full_text": "Kasey turned to her best friends just outside the door of Happy Burger. She managed not to squeal as she shared her news. “What you are about to witness is the incredibly adorable Cody Loman in action. He’s the new cashier, and he’s totally dreamy. Here, Tammy, hold my purse while I fix my hair.” “Oh no, not another one,” moaned Tammy. “And just how much older is this guy?” inquired Juliet. Kasey dismissed Tammy’s comment with a wave of her hand. “He’s just sixteen, only three years older than me. Oh, don’t look at me like that, my parents are seven years apart and they do just fine.” “Yeah, but they didn’t marry until after college,” muttered Tammy, but Kasey wasn’t going to miss her moment. “Okay, I’m ready,” declared Kasey. ”Come on you guys, you have to see him. Besides, I’m hungry, and the movie starts soon. You too Munchkin, let’s go.” Billy followed his big sister and her friends to the counter. He didn’t see anything special about this Cody, he looked like any other older boy. The girls seemed to think differently though. They did their best to flirt and act silly to keep his attention as they ordered. Kasey remembered to get a kid’s meal for her brother, and then handed over a twenty-dollar bill. Cody smiled right into Kasey’s eyes as he rattled off the numbers. Eleven fifty-eight out of twenty dollars, you get eight forty-two in change. His fingers touched her palm as he handed over the coins, and she giggled and blushed. Then he held up a folded stack of bills and counted slowly to eight as he flipped through them. He handed Kasey the bills with a wink and packed their food to go. Kasey kept her eyes on him while slipping her money into her purse, ready with a last smile for him when he delivered their meal. “You all be sure to come back now,” he encouraged them. “Don’t worry, she will,” chorused Tammy and Juliet. Kasey blushed even more, but waved daintily back at Cody as they walked out. The girls ate as they walked to the theater, talking with mouths full of burger and fries, and bursting out in laughter that threatened to spurt Diet Coke out their noses. Billy trailed slightly behind, enjoying his prize and thankful to be ignored for the time being. His peace ended just as they reached the theater. Tammy had just finished a chorus of “Cody and Kasey, sitting in a tree...” when Juliet chimed in with “Oh Cody, your buns are so toasty.” All three erupted in gales of laughter. Kasey had been drinking at that exact moment, so her eruption was more vivid by far. Fizz poured down her face and onto her favorite ruffled shirt. “Oh no! This is awful!” she gasped. “Hold this, Munchkin,” she commanded, thrusting her purse into Billy’s arms. Then she ran off to the theater’s restroom. The usher raised an eyebrow, but decided not to stop her. Kasey’s friends couldn’t help but keep snickering at him while they waited in the lobby for her return. Billy did his best to look like he wasn’t carrying a girl’s purse. Seeing one of his friends enter the theater, he quickly passed the purse over to Juliet so his friends would not see him holding a purse. When Kasey finally came back, she was composed and only slightly damp. Juliet handed back the purse, and Billy stood as far from his sister as he dared – not taking any chances she’d give it to him again. “All right ladies,” Juliet began, “tonight we have the choice of mermaids romancing lifeguards, government conspiracies, or flesh-crazed zombies. What’s it going to be? Step right up and cast your vote. You too, Shorty.” Kasey protested. “Munchkins only vote in the case of a tie.” It didn’t make a difference. Four votes were cast, and the decision was unanimous – flesh-crazed zombies it would be. They stepped over to the ticket counter and announced their decision. “Seven dollars each,” came the reply. The girls dove into their purses, digging through lipstick and photos, key chains, cell phones and bubblegum to find their funds. Kasey found her change but soon sounded a cry of outrage. “Where’s the rest of my money?” “What’s wrong, Kasey?” asked Tammy, concerned for her friend. Juliet looked worried too. “I only have half my money. I’m missing four dollars.” “Oh no,” said Tammy, “you didn’t drop it somewhere did you?” “How could I drop only half of my money? It was all folded together.” After another moment of thought, she declared “Someone must have stolen it!” Juliet spoke up. “Don’t go overboard, who would want to steal your money?” “Well…” Kasey looked for a likely suspect. “Each of you held my purse for a while tonight. Someone swiped my money while they were holding my purse. Each of you needs to show me your money so I can figure out who took it.” Billy got mad and yelled back in his high-pitched voice. “I didn’t take your stupid money, and I hate your ugly purse!” Kasey didn’t believe him, of course. “Let’s see in your pockets then.” Glaring at her, Billy turned out his pockets. Some green paper was revealed, he spread it out to show that it was a ten dollar bill. “Where did you get that?” snapped Kasey. “Mom gave it to me, she didn’t think you’d remember to save enough to buy me a ticket.” Kasey opened her mouth to respond, but stopped – realizing that she had indeed forgotten, even if she hadn’t lost four bucks. Juliet sighed. “Honestly Kasey, you aren’t going to have many friends left if you keep up like this. I only touched your purse for a moment tonight. The only way that I could have your money would be if I had teamed up with Billy and he had slipped me your money. And you know I don’t like the Munchkin.” Kasey was still suspicious. “Okay then, prove it.” “Well, all right…” Juliet walked over to Billy and punched him in the arm. “OW!” yelled Billy, and tried to kick her back. She stepped back and stared him down, so he settled for nursing his wound. Kasey was not amused. “That wasn’t what I meant. Show me your money.” “Oh, honestly.” Juliet had a five and two ones, just enough for the movie. As Kasey turned to Tammy, Tammy asked again, “You want to accuse your best pal of theft? I’m hurt. Are you sure you didn’t lose it?” Meanwhile she held out her money, which was seven singles.” Before Kasey could yell at Tammy, Juliet stepped in. “No, she didn’t lose it, and I know who did take it.” Kasey stared at her, expectantly. “All right, I’ll tell you, but you have to stop acting like a freak.” Kasey nodded humbly. With everyone waiting and listening to her, Juliet explained.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What is really missing?  \n   • The cashier tells Kasey her change is $8.42. That means the change must consist of 42¢ in coins and eight dollar bills.  \n   • A little later Kasey finds only four dollar bills in her purse, so exactly four dollars are “missing”.\n\n2. When was the last time anyone definitely saw (or rather heard) eight dollar bills?  \n   • Only one person ever handled the money while it was still visible: Cody, the cashier.  \n   • He “held up a folded stack of bills and counted slowly to eight as he flipped through them”.  \n   • Because the bills were folded, he could have made one bill look like two, or slipped two bills back into the drawer while “flipping”.\n\n3. Did Kasey ever verify eight bills?  \n   • No. She was too busy giggling and staring at Cody. She simply “slipped her money into her purse”.\n\n4. Could any of the friends have taken four dollars later?  \n   • Opportunity:  \n        – Tammy held the purse only before the food was paid for, when the eight dollars were not yet inside.  \n        – Billy held the purse while Kasey ran to the restroom; but he did so in a crowded lobby with his hands full of food and drink, and soon handed it to Juliet.  \n        – Juliet had it for a few minutes, also in full view of everyone.  \n   • Motive / payoff: Whoever supposedly stole the money would now have four extra singles.  \n        – Juliet shows a five and two ones: exactly $7 (the ticket price).  \n        – Tammy shows seven singles: again $7.  \n        – Billy produces a single ten-dollar bill given to him by his mother.  \n   None of them possesses an unexplained stack of four one-dollar bills.\n\n5. Logical conclusion  \n   • Nobody after Cody had both opportunity and unexplained benefit.  \n   • The only plausible moment the four dollars disappeared is at the counter, i.e. Kasey was short-changed.  \n   • Therefore Cody is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCody Loman, Tammy (no surname given), Juliet (no surname given), Billy (Kasey’s brother), Kasey herself\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCody Loman\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Kasey hands Cody a twenty-dollar bill for an $11.58 order.  \n• Cody deliberately palms four of the dollar bills, folds the remaining four in half, then flips them while counting “one-two-three-…-eight”, making it look as though there are eight separate bills.  \n• Kasey, entranced by the “dreamy” cashier, does not really look; she drops the money straight into her purse.  \n• After the group walks to the theatre and the purse has been passed around, Kasey finally counts her change and discovers only four dollars.  \n• She assumes the money was stolen during the purse-passing, but Juliet quickly realises that nobody who held the purse has the missing four singles, so the only logical explanation is that Kasey never received them.  \n• The missing money is therefore still in Cody’s till—or pocket.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nTammy – held the purse only before any change was inside; she now possesses exactly $7 in singles, no unexplained gain.  \nJuliet – had the purse briefly; she too has only the $7 needed for her own ticket.  \nBilly – carries a single ten-dollar bill given to him by his mother; he never had a handful of singles to hide.  \nKasey – simply failed to notice she was short-changed; she lost no money after leaving the restaurant.  \nThus none of them had both opportunity and unexplained possession of four one-dollar bills. Only Cody, who handled the cash in the first place, could have removed the four dollars.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

What’s it going to be? Step right up and cast your vote. You too, Shorty.” Kasey protested. “Munchkins only vote in the case of a tie.” It didn’t make a difference. Four votes were cast, and the decision was unanimous – flesh-crazed zombies it would be. They stepped over to the ticket counter and announced their decision. “Seven dollars each,” came the reply. The girls dove into their purses, digging through lipstick and photos, key chains, cell phones and bubblegum to find their funds. Kasey found her change but soon sounded a cry of outrage. “Where’s the rest of my money?” “What’s wrong, Kasey?” asked Tammy, concerned for her friend. Juliet looked worried too. “I only have half my money. I’m missing four dollars.” “Oh no,” said Tammy, “you didn’t drop it somewhere did you?” “How could I drop only half of my money? It was all folded together.” After another moment of thought, she declared “Someone must have stolen it!” Juliet spoke up. “Don’t go overboard, who would want to steal your money?” “Well…” Kasey looked for a likely suspect. “Each of you held my purse for a while tonight. Someone swiped my money while they were holding my purse. Each of you needs to show me your money so I can figure out who took it.” Billy got mad and yelled back in his high-pitched voice. “I didn’t take your stupid money, and I hate your ugly purse!” Kasey didn’t believe him, of course. “Let’s see in your pockets then.” Glaring at her, Billy turned out his pockets. Some green paper was revealed, he spread it out to show that it was a ten dollar bill. “Where did you get that?” snapped Kasey. “Mom gave it to me, she didn’t think you’d remember to save enough to buy me a ticket.” Kasey opened her mouth to respond, but stopped – realizing that she had indeed forgotten, even if she hadn’t lost four bucks. Juliet sighed. “Honestly Kasey, you aren’t going to have many friends left if you keep up like this. I only touched your purse for a moment tonight. The only way that I could have your money would be if I had teamed up with Billy and he had slipped me your money. And you know I don’t like the Munchkin.” Kasey was still suspicious. “Okay then, prove it.” “Well, all right…” Juliet walked over to Billy and punched him in the arm. “OW!” yelled Billy, and tried to kick her back. She stepped back and stared him down, so he settled for nursing his wound. Kasey was not amused. “That wasn’t what I meant. Show me your money.” “Oh, honestly.” Juliet had a five and two ones, just enough for the movie. As Kasey turned to Tammy, Tammy asked again, “You want to accuse your best pal of theft? I’m hurt. Are you sure you didn’t lose it?” Meanwhile she held out her money, which was seven singles.” Before Kasey could yell at Tammy, Juliet stepped in. “No, she didn’t lose it, and I know who did take it.” Kasey stared at her, expectantly. “All right, I’ll tell you, but you have to stop acting like a freak.” Kasey nodded humbly. With everyone waiting and listening to her, Juliet explained.",

      "outcome": "“While each of us touched your purse, that does not mean that we each had a chance to take your money. Even if Tammy has seven singles, unless Tammy can travel in time, I don’t see how she could have taken your change before you even got it.”\n“Next is the Munchkin. Since he only has a ten-dollar bill, he obviously does not have your four singles. Likewise, I only have a five and two-ones, so I did not take it. We’ve settled that none of us took your money, and that you didn’t lose it, right? Then that leaves just one other person who touched your money tonight.”\nKasey still looked blank, so Juliet continued.\n“Hand me your money please – and don’t worry, I’ll give it right back to you.”\nHesitantly, Kasey gave her the four bills.\nJuliet demonstrated carefully, first folding the stack of bills in half, then counting down the ends one by one. “One – two – three – four – five – six – seven – eight. Here’s your eight dollars, ma’am.”\nKasey gasped as she took the money back. “Cody!” she shouted. “He distracted me with his charm while he stole my money!”\nTammy and Juliet both rolled their eyes, but nodded in agreement. The four hurried back to Happy Burger, and found Cody’s manager. He fired the unfortunate thief, gave Kasey her four dollars back, and offered them all complimentary drinks as an apology.\nThey made it back to the theater in record time, missing only most of the previews, and when the flesh-crazed zombies turned out to be uproariously funny, they all wound up laughing Coke out their noses. Except for Billy that is – he fell asleep."
