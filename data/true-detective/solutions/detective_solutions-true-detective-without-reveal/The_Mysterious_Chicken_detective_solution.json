    "full_text": "Ed liked chicken. He liked it baked, barbecued, boiled, or fried. Sure, he liked other foods—mashed potatoes, corn, green beans, and pie. But most of all, he liked chicken. And this led to a mystery that was both confusing ... and delicious! The sun was setting on Ed's farm that night, and it was almost time for Sunday dinner. Ed had invited his best friend over to share a very special dinner: a whole roasted chicken. For this recipe, his mother had soaked peach halves in a tomato-garlic sauce, then laid them in a ring around the chicken in the oven, slow-roasting them both for an entire hour. Ed’s mother was delighted that he enjoyed her cooking so much, so she was always trying new recipes to make the chicken taste different. Ed poked his smiling face into the kitchen, and took a deep whiff of the tasty smells coming from the oven. “Not yet,” said Ed’s mother with a smile. She fussed over every meal to make sure it was perfect. “What time is your friend getting here?” “Six o’clock,” Ed said. “He better hurry,” Ed’s mother replied. “It’s almost ready, and the peach halves will dry out if we don’t eat them right away!” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* As a practical joke, Zeke had brought along a pizza. All weekend, he’d been imagining what he’d say to Ed: “Well shucks, Ed, you can have chicken any old time. But this is fresh pizza!” He’d scoured town for the cheapest pizza he could find. As he walked up Ed’s long driveway, he saw Ed’s little terrier running towards him, yipping. “Shh!” Zeke said to the terrier, and reached down to pet it. He set the pizza on the ground behind him, but kept a close eye on the little dog so he wouldn’t run over and eat it. Zeke scratched the dog behind the ears and under its chin. “You’re a silly little dog, aren’t you?” Zeke cooed. He admired the dog’s shaggy bangs and its tiny mouth. “I bet you wish you had fresh pizza for dinner.” Zeke heard a noise over his shoulder. The terrier was still in front of him, and Zeke spun around, confused. He looked just in time to see Ed’s other dog, a big husky, devouring his pizza. The dog had somehow nuzzled the lid open, and was already chomping on its cheesy toppings. “Hey!” Zeke shouted, but the dog ignored him. “Get away from that!” Zeke laughed and started to grab the box away, but the dog put his paws on the cardboard, and then sank his teeth into the crust. Amazingly, a big double piece stayed in the dog’s mouth, and the happy husky ran off with it, down to the ditch to enjoy his dinner. “Dogs can’t have pizza!” Zeke shouted after him. “It’s bad for your digestion! Or something ...” He chased after the husky, who just ran farther ahead when he heard Zeke coming. As the dog ran, Zeke could see the pizza still dangling from its mouth. Zeke turned around to head back toward Ed’s house—just in time to see the tiny terrier walking across the remaining pizza slices. It was licking the cheesy toppings like it was some kind of junk food water dish—and wagging its tail happily. Just then Ed walked out of the house. “It was nice of you to bring a pizza for my dogs,” Ed said. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* At the dinner table, Zeke explained about his practical joke gone bad. “You like chicken so much,” he explained, “I just thought it’d be funny to—” “You and your jokes,” Ed said. “Someday someone’s going to play one on you!” “I think your dogs already did,” Zeke said with a laugh. Ed’s mother smiled at their conversation as she carried in the serving plate with the chicken. She had covered it in a fancy glass dish to keep it warm. The tomato-garlic sauce simmered and warm steam rose to the top of the glass from the ring of yellow peaches around the golden-brown chicken. “Chicken!” Ed said. “You boys get started,” Ed’s mother said. “I need to run to the basement to put the laundry in the dryer. I’ll join you in a few minutes.” Suddenly a furious noise came from the front yard. Ed’s terrier was barking, and it sounded like a mountain lion was growling back! Ed bolted to the front door, and Zeke ran off after him. “That terrier acts like he’s not afraid of anything,” Ed said. “He’ll never go near another animal, but he’ll yip and yip like he’s king of the world. Sometimes the other animals even believe it!” When Zeke got to the doorway, he started laughing. The terrier was in an argument, all right, but not with a mountain lion—with the neighbor’s cat! The cat yowled back at the dog like a mountain lion, squawling aggressively in hopes that the tiny dog would run away and leave the pizza. “Get!” Ed said to the cat, while his dog continued to bark. “Haven’t you caused enough trouble?” Ed asked the terrier, scooping up the pizza box to take it over to the trash. “We thought you’d seen a mountain lion, but it was just a little puddy tat.” “All that noise over some pepperoni,” Zeke grumbled. “Next time, I’ll just bring dog food.” But Ed looked over at the cat, who was loping down the driveway. “Is he hurt?” Ed asked. Zeke studied the cat, but he couldn’t tell. Cats always seemed to walk funny to him. “I bet he’s just disappointed,” Zeke said. “He wanted to be the third animal eating my pizza tonight.” But Ed ignored him, calling out gently to the cat. “My neighbor loves that cat,” he told Zeke. “Does he look like he’s limping?” Zeke said he couldn’t tell, but Ed looked worried. “I need to make sure that my terrier didn't injure him.” The cat meowed sadly, but didn’t run. It just looked confused—and, yes, a little hungry. Ed told Zeke, “You better throw that pizza away in the compost bin out back.” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* A little while later, Ed told Zeke that the cat was okay. “He was just trying to figure out how a little dog like that could make so much noise, I think.” Ed said he’d watched the cat for nearly ten minutes—and Zeke said it had taken him that long just to figure out where the compost bin was. After all that, Ed’s mother insisted that they both wash their hands again—Zeke’s were covered with cheese and grease, and Ed could’ve gotten bacteria from checking on the cat. “And then stop horsing around,” she shouted, “so we can enjoy my nice chicken dinner!” Ed and Zeke used the sink in the bathroom at the top of the stairs, but when they came back down, another surprise was waiting for them. The chicken dinner had disappeared. The roasted chicken had been left on the table in the dining room—covered with the glass dish that would keep it warm. Now the dish was still there—the clear, shiny glass looking spotless and elegant. But there was no chicken under it. Everyone was more than ready to enjoy the tasty tomato-garlic chicken with peaches, but first they’d have to answer one question: Who stole it?",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. List everybody who could possibly have taken the bird.\n\n   • Ed’s mother  \n   • Ed  \n   • Zeke  \n   • The neighbour (never actually appears, only the cat does)  \n   • Ed’s husky  \n   • Ed’s terrier  \n   • The neighbour’s cat  \n\n2. What has to be done to make the chicken vanish?  \n   • The heavy-glass cover must be lifted.  \n   • The whole, still-hot chicken has to be removed cleanly.  \n   • The cover has to be put neatly back in place – it is described as “clear, shiny, spotless and elegant,” so it was not knocked to the floor or left askew.  \n   That is delicate, two-handed work; a person can do it easily, an animal almost certainly cannot.\n\n3. Motive.\n\n   Ed’s mother – none. She cooked the meal and wants everyone to eat it.  \n   Ed – he loves chicken but invited Zeke to share it; no reason to steal it and spoil his own dinner.  \n   Zeke – he is a practical-joke addict. His first joke (bringing the cheap pizza) has already back-fired. He has just been embarrassed by Ed’s dogs – they ate his pizza while Ed laughed. Zeke now has both (a) motive for another prank and (b) a childish wish for revenge (“Someday someone’s going to play one on you,” Ed had teased him).  \n   Animals – motive (hunger) exists, but not the dexterity for the glass cover.\n\n4. Opportunity (who was in the house and unobserved?).\n\n   • When the barking started, Ed and Zeke both ran outside, and Ed’s mother went to the basement.  \n   • A little later Ed stayed in the front yard for almost ten minutes watching the cat.  \n   • During exactly those ten minutes Zeke went back into the house “to find the compost bin out back.” He himself says it took him the entire ten minutes.  \n   Therefore, while Ed is outside and his mother is either still in the basement or elsewhere, Zeke is the only human alone inside the house with the chicken.\n\n5. Physical evidence / behaviour.\n\n   • The lid is back on perfectly – something Zeke could do but the dogs or cat could not.  \n   • Zeke’s hands were already “covered with cheese and grease” from the pizza; if they also picked up a hot, greasy chicken no one would be able to tell the difference – Ed’s mother only notices that his hands are greasy, not why.  \n   • Zeke’s story about taking ten minutes to find the compost bin is suspicious; Ed lives there and the bin should have been easy to spot. The long delay is classic cover time for a prank.\n\n6. Likely course of events: Zeke removes the lid, puts the chicken into the empty pizza box, snaps the lid back smartly, walks out the back door, drops the mangled remains of pizza plus chicken into (or beside) the compost bin – where the already pizza-loving husky very probably finishes it off – and then returns, claiming the search for the bin took ages.\n\n7. Dogs / cat as accomplices. Zeke may not even have meant to give them the chicken, but once it was outside the animals quickly finished it, explaining why no trace is left.\n\nLogical deduction: the only creature with both the opportunity and the physical ability to leave the scene exactly as described is Zeke.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEd’s mother, Ed, Zeke, Ed’s husky, Ed’s terrier, Neighbour’s cat\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nZeke\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nEd’s husky (informal, unwitting accomplice that actually ate the chicken once Zeke dumped it)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Ed’s mother places the roasted chicken on the dining-room table under a glass dome and goes to the basement.  \n• The barking/cat commotion draws Ed and Zeke outside; the front door is left open.  \n• Ed stays in the front yard tending to the neighbour’s cat.  \n• Annoyed at losing his pizza and itching for another prank, Zeke re-enters the empty house on his way to the back yard.  \n• He pauses in the dining room, lifts the glass cover, slides the hot chicken into his nearly empty pizza box (protecting his hands with the cardboard), sets the glass lid carefully back on the platter and walks out the rear door.  \n• Behind the house he drops the box into (or next to) the compost bin. Ed’s husky, already experienced at food theft, follows the smell, pulls the chicken from the box and devours it.  \n• Zeke returns to the front of the house; to explain the delay he says it “took that long just to figure out where the compost bin was.”  \n• Ed’s mother meets them, orders both boys to wash up. While they are upstairs the husky polishes off the last scraps.  \n• When everyone finally assembles at the table, only the empty glass dish remains – the chicken is gone.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nEd’s mother – never left the basement/kitchen area until after the chicken was gone, and she plainly expected the food still to be there.  \nEd – was outside the whole time, in clear view, worrying about the neighbour’s cat.  \nEd’s terrier – too small to reach the table, certainly unable to lift and replace a heavy glass lid.  \nNeighbour’s cat – was in the driveway under Ed’s gaze, and likewise lacks the dexterity to manipulate the lid.  \nEd’s husky – did eat the chicken but only after Zeke handed it the opportunity; the dog could not have replaced the glass cover so neatly by itself. Thus the husky is, at most, an unwitting accomplice, not the mastermind.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

Ed’s mother was delighted that he enjoyed her cooking so much, so she was always trying new recipes to make the chicken taste different. Ed poked his smiling face into the kitchen, and took a deep whiff of the tasty smells coming from the oven. “Not yet,” said Ed’s mother with a smile. She fussed over every meal to make sure it was perfect. “What time is your friend getting here?” “Six o’clock,” Ed said. “He better hurry,” Ed’s mother replied. “It’s almost ready, and the peach halves will dry out if we don’t eat them right away!” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* As a practical joke, Zeke had brought along a pizza. All weekend, he’d been imagining what he’d say to Ed: “Well shucks, Ed, you can have chicken any old time. But this is fresh pizza!” He’d scoured town for the cheapest pizza he could find. As he walked up Ed’s long driveway, he saw Ed’s little terrier running towards him, yipping. “Shh!” Zeke said to the terrier, and reached down to pet it. He set the pizza on the ground behind him, but kept a close eye on the little dog so he wouldn’t run over and eat it. Zeke scratched the dog behind the ears and under its chin. “You’re a silly little dog, aren’t you?” Zeke cooed. He admired the dog’s shaggy bangs and its tiny mouth. “I bet you wish you had fresh pizza for dinner.” Zeke heard a noise over his shoulder. The terrier was still in front of him, and Zeke spun around, confused. He looked just in time to see Ed’s other dog, a big husky, devouring his pizza. The dog had somehow nuzzled the lid open, and was already chomping on its cheesy toppings. “Hey!” Zeke shouted, but the dog ignored him. “Get away from that!” Zeke laughed and started to grab the box away, but the dog put his paws on the cardboard, and then sank his teeth into the crust. Amazingly, a big double piece stayed in the dog’s mouth, and the happy husky ran off with it, down to the ditch to enjoy his dinner. “Dogs can’t have pizza!” Zeke shouted after him. “It’s bad for your digestion! Or something ...” He chased after the husky, who just ran farther ahead when he heard Zeke coming. As the dog ran, Zeke could see the pizza still dangling from its mouth. Zeke turned around to head back toward Ed’s house—just in time to see the tiny terrier walking across the remaining pizza slices. It was licking the cheesy toppings like it was some kind of junk food water dish—and wagging its tail happily. Just then Ed walked out of the house. “It was nice of you to bring a pizza for my dogs,” Ed said. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* At the dinner table, Zeke explained about his practical joke gone bad. “You like chicken so much,” he explained, “I just thought it’d be funny to—” “You and your jokes,” Ed said. “Someday someone’s going to play one on you!” “I think your dogs already did,” Zeke said with a laugh. Ed’s mother smiled at their conversation as she carried in the serving plate with the chicken. She had covered it in a fancy glass dish to keep it warm. The tomato-garlic sauce simmered and warm steam rose to the top of the glass from the ring of yellow peaches around the golden-brown chicken. “Chicken!” Ed said. “You boys get started,” Ed’s mother said. “I need to run to the basement to put the laundry in the dryer. I’ll join you in a few minutes.” Suddenly a furious noise came from the front yard. Ed’s terrier was barking, and it sounded like a mountain lion was growling back! Ed bolted to the front door, and Zeke ran off after him. “That terrier acts like he’s not afraid of anything,” Ed said. “He’ll never go near another animal, but he’ll yip and yip like he’s king of the world. Sometimes the other animals even believe it!” When Zeke got to the doorway, he started laughing. The terrier was in an argument, all right, but not with a mountain lion—with the neighbor’s cat! The cat yowled back at the dog like a mountain lion, squawling aggressively in hopes that the tiny dog would run away and leave the pizza. “Get!” Ed said to the cat, while his dog continued to bark. “Haven’t you caused enough trouble?” Ed asked the terrier, scooping up the pizza box to take it over to the trash. “We thought you’d seen a mountain lion, but it was just a little puddy tat.” “All that noise over some pepperoni,” Zeke grumbled. “Next time, I’ll just bring dog food.” But Ed looked over at the cat, who was loping down the driveway. “Is he hurt?” Ed asked. Zeke studied the cat, but he couldn’t tell. Cats always seemed to walk funny to him. “I bet he’s just disappointed,” Zeke said. “He wanted to be the third animal eating my pizza tonight.” But Ed ignored him, calling out gently to the cat. “My neighbor loves that cat,” he told Zeke. “Does he look like he’s limping?” Zeke said he couldn’t tell, but Ed looked worried. “I need to make sure that my terrier didn't injure him.” The cat meowed sadly, but didn’t run. It just looked confused—and, yes, a little hungry. Ed told Zeke, “You better throw that pizza away in the compost bin out back.” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* A little while later, Ed told Zeke that the cat was okay. “He was just trying to figure out how a little dog like that could make so much noise, I think.” Ed said he’d watched the cat for nearly ten minutes—and Zeke said it had taken him that long just to figure out where the compost bin was. After all that, Ed’s mother insisted that they both wash their hands again—Zeke’s were covered with cheese and grease, and Ed could’ve gotten bacteria from checking on the cat. “And then stop horsing around,” she shouted, “so we can enjoy my nice chicken dinner!” Ed and Zeke used the sink in the bathroom at the top of the stairs, but when they came back down, another surprise was waiting for them. The chicken dinner had disappeared. The roasted chicken had been left on the table in the dining room—covered with the glass dish that would keep it warm. Now the dish was still there—the clear, shiny glass looking spotless and elegant. But there was no chicken under it. Everyone was more than ready to enjoy the tasty tomato-garlic chicken with peaches, but first they’d have to answer one question: Who stole it?",
      "answer_options": "(a) Ed; (b) Ed’s Husky; (c) Ed's mother; (d) Zeke",
      "answer": "(a) Ed",
      "outcome": "“That’s not funny,” Ed said to his mother. “I’m hungry!”\n“So am I!” Ed’s mother said. “Zeke, did you hide my roasted chicken?”\n“No!” said Zeke. “Seriously—no! My last prank with the pizza failed miserably. I wouldn’t double down with a chicken joke!”\n“Well, I didn’t take it!” Ed said. “If I had, I’d’ve eaten it, too!”\n“Maybe your husky ate it,” said Zeke. “For dessert.”\n“Are you freakin’ kidding me?” Ed shouted, frustrated at his ridiculous bad luck.\n“Your dogs work as a team,” Zeke said. “The little one distracts you while the big one steals your food.”\n“You know I didn’t steal it,” said Ed’s mother. “I wouldn’t postpone dinner—I was worried about the peaches drying up! And besides, I’ve been busy in the basement with the laundry!”\n“And I don’t think Zeke stole it, either,” she continued. “We would see his greasy fingerprints on that bell jar if he’d tried to life the cover.”\n“And that lets off your husky, too,” said Zeke. “He may have nuzzled the lid open on that pizza box, but there’s no way he could’ve lifted up a heavy glass cover—even if there was a delicious looking chicken under it.”\n“But wait … your terrier is the biggest clue,” Zeke said. “You told me that terrier never goes near another animal, Ed—that he just barks at them.”\n“It’s true,” said Ed.\n“So then you wouldn’t really be worried that he’d injured your neighbor’s cat. He couldn’t injure that cat if he wouldn’t go near it!”\n“You were tricking Zeke!” shouted Ed’s mother. “You could sneak away our chicken once Ed was out back by compost bin.”\nEd grinned, and said, “Ya caught me. The chicken’s in the refrigerator. But I finally got to play a joke on you, ya big wise guy!\n“Now let’s eat. I’m really hungry ...”"
