    "full_text": "It was 8:35 A.M. and Cynthia Peck was not only in a bad mood but late for work as well, which was most unusual for her. Not only was she late, but rain had been coming down in a torrential downpour since 7:13. She knew it was 7:13 because that is what the digital clock in her automobile reflected as the first thick raindrops splattered her windshield. As she entered the Ames building, she cursed silently that her oversized umbrella had done a poor job of keeping her dry. But, today, it was probably good that she was late, for it could possibly be herself that her administrative assistant, Megan Brewer, found dead on the floor of her spacious office. Cynthia Peck was 37 years old and a vice president of the Ames Marketing Company. She did not become a company vice president by being weak or faint hearted. She knew something was wrong as she exited the sixth floor elevator and met several uniformed police officers waiting for her to arrive. Before the officers had a chance to say anything to her, she asked, “What is going on?” Detective Sergeant Kyle Whitmore answered, “Are you Cynthia Peck?” “Yes,’ she replied and asked again, “What’s going on?” “There is a dead man in your office. Your assistant, Ms. Brewer, found him this morning. Identification in his wallet shows him to be Mr. Trent Willis. Do you know him?” Cynthia showed no emotion as she answered, “Yes, we had a meeting in my office scheduled for this morning. What happened?” “He was murdered,” the detective answered, watching Cynthia carefully, and added, “he has a letter opener in his chest. The only belongings we found were his cell phone and briefcase.” The detective did not share with her the fact that the state of her office indicated the powerfully built Willis, whose driver’s license showed him to be 35 years old, put up a violent but futile struggle with his attacker. Cynthia now felt a slight dizziness. Small beads of perspiration broke out upon her high forehead as she asked, without visible emotion, “Who did it?” “We don’t know yet,” Sergeant Whitmore answered, noticing the wetness on Cynthia’s clothing. He pointed towards the end of the hall and said, “Please join us in the conference room after taking a moment to dry off.” “Thank you,” she gratefully replied. Upon entering the conference room, Cynthia saw that her assistant, Megan Brewer, was already seated along with her boss, company president Steve Ledbetter and a member of her marketing team, Josh Kesler. She quickly took a seat and noted that a uniformed policeman stood at the door. Anyone wishing to enter or exit the room would have to do so through the officer. The four Ames employees looked expectantly at Sergeant Whitmore. Whitmore silently noted to himself that the Ames employees, with the exception of Steve Ledbetter, appeared to be between 35-40 years old and in good physical condition. President Ledbetter was the exception, being 58 years old and at least 50 pounds overweight. He began to speak, “Ms. Brewer found the victim at 7:51 this morning. Mr. Willis, as you know, Ms. Peck, had an 8:15 appointment to see you. Ms. Brewer claims not to know how he got to the sixth floor and into the office. I know that I do not need to tell you that the stairways are locked and a pass code is needed to exit the elevator on the sixth floor. Now, Ms. Peck and Ms. Brewer are the only persons with a passkey into Ms. Peck’s office, but Ms. Brewer informs us that she left her passkey on her outer office desk for a few moments while in the break room getting a cup of coffee. Security tells us that four persons accessed the sixth floor before 7:51.” Whitmore stopped for a moment to catch his breath and, with a sweeping motion of his hand, added, “And those persons are all of you. Before anyone asks, records show Ms. Peck exited the elevator at 6:45, a little over an hour before Mr. Trent was discovered.” “It’s true, Sergeant. Stupidly, I left the signed contract I was to give to Mr. Willis at home. I had to return home and get it.” The sergeant looked at Cynthia and said, “OK, for now. What security shows is that Ms. Peck arrived at 6:45, and Ms. Brewer was next at 6:59. At 7:25, Mr. Kesler arrived. Mr. Ledbetter was last to arrive at 7:40.” Sgt. Whitmore paused and looked at each of them in turn before adding, “It’s highly unlikely that somebody hid overnight on the sixth floor, but we’re checking security cameras as I speak. What is much more likely is that one of you murdered Trent Willis.” Megan felt faint and began to weep. Softly, Sgt. Whitmore said to her, “I’m sorry, Ms. Brewer, this is unpleasant but necessary. Steve Ledbetter asked, “Why not check the cameras to see when Mr. Willis entered?” “Because lightning knocked them out early this morning, before the rains hit,” was the sergeant’s reply. Turning to Cynthia, he said, “Let’s begin with you, Ms. Peck. You first arrived at 6:45. Did you enter your office?” “Yes. It was then that I discovered that I left the contract at home. I left to retrieve it.” “Security shows you left the sixth floor at 6:49,” Whitmore noted, “That’s right,” Cynthia answered. “So it took you an hour and 46 minutes to get back here?” Whitmore asked. “Right again. The rain hit at 7:13 by my car radio and traffic crawled to a stop. I was in my car the entire time, except for the short time I was in my apartment retrieving the contract.” Cynthia thought for a moment as Whitmore’s eyes bored into her and then added, “I made several cell phone calls from my car, one of them around 7:10 to the newspaper delivery service, one to my husband’s office around 7:35 and another just after 8:00 to my doctor’s office. Telephone company records will show my cell phone to be a long way from here between shortly after leaving until after 8:15 or so.” As she said this, she handed Sgt. Whitmore her cell phone. Whitmore thanked her and turned to Cynthia’s assistant, Megan Brewer, who had composed herself. He stated, “You exited the elevator at 6:59. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you arrived?” “Nothing. I noticed the lightning outside the windows but that is all.” Thinking for a moment, he asked, “Did Ms. Peck call you at anytime after leaving to return home? “No, but that is not unusual. She only calls when she needs to. This morning, she sent an email before leaving, explaining the situation and asking me to make Mr. Willis comfortable.” Whitmore turned to Josh Kesler and asked, “What about you? You got here at 7:25. Did you see or hear anything out of the ordinary?” “No,” was his response. Did you make any calls on your cell phone or from the office; anything that can prove you are not the killer?” Nervously, Josh replied, “No, nothing.” Whitmore thought for a long moment, and then asked Steve Ledbetter. “Do you have a raincoat?” “Yes, but I do not have it with me. As president of the company, I have a car and driver at my disposal. Maurice always lets me out right at the front door so I never wear a coat.” Turning back to Josh Kesler, “And you? Do you have a raincoat?” Josh was puzzled but answered, “No, but I have an umbrella. If you want to see it, it’s drying in my office.” Sergeant Whitmore had seen a lot in his 12 years as a homicide investigator, but never anything as bizarre as this. Pointing to the murderer, he said to the officer guarding the door, “Arrest this person for second degree murder.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could physically have reached the 6th floor?\n • The stair-doors are locked and only the elevator (which keeps an electronic record) was used this morning.  \n • Only four people got off the lift before the body was found – Cynthia Peck, Megan Brewer, Josh Kesler and Steve Ledbetter – so the murderer must be one of the four.\n\n2. Who could open Cynthia Peck’s inner office?\n • Only Cynthia and Megan possess pass-keys.  \n • Anyone else would have had to steal Megan’s key while she was briefly in the break-room.  \n • Therefore every suspect still has the practical possibility of getting into the office, but Megan and Cynthia needn’t steal anything.\n\n3. Time window\n • The body is discovered at 7 : 51.  \n • Cynthia leaves the floor at 6 : 49 and does not return until 8 : 35 (confirmed by building log and by telephone records she volunteers).  \n • Megan is continuously present from 6 : 59 to 7 : 51 with the exception of a very short coffee break.  \n • Josh arrives at 7 : 25 and Steve at 7 : 40.  \n • Realistically the murder happened between 7 : 25 and 7 : 51 – after Josh and before discovery.\n\n4. Condition of the suspects’ clothing (the decisive clue)\n • A torrential rain has fallen since 7 : 13.  \n • Cynthia comes in at 8 : 35 soaked in spite of an “oversized umbrella.”  \n • Josh admits he used an umbrella and left it to drip-dry in his office; he could therefore have kept himself relatively dry.  \n • Megan arrived before the rain began, so quite naturally she is dry.  \n • Steve claims he arrived at 7 : 40, had no umbrella and no rain-coat, and yet Sergeant Whitmore does not describe him as wet at all.\n\n This is impossible: anyone who stepped out of a car into a “torrential downpour” without any protection would be soaking.  \n Only one conclusion fits the facts – Steve was already inside the building before the rain started.  The “7 : 40” elevator record was therefore a second trip up, made to create a false alibi after the killing.\n\n5. Physical capacity\n • The victim was “powerfully built” and the room showed signs of a fierce struggle.  A surprise stab with the letter-opener, followed by a short fight, is plausible for a heavy, older man who outweighed the victim, and far more plausible than for the much lighter Megan.  Nothing about Steve’s build rules it out.\n\n6. Motive (probable, though not essential for the deduction)\n • As company president Steve would be the person most threatened if Trent Willis’s contract disadvantaged the firm or exposed wrongdoing.  A violent, spur-of-the-moment solution would constitute second-degree murder.\n\n7. Logical deduction\n • Every story given fits the external facts except Steve’s – the weather proves it false.  \n • Because his real arrival was earlier than he admits, he had ample time to hide in or near Cynthia’s office, confront Willis when he came in, kill him, and then ride the elevator back down so that the system would log a “7 : 40 arrival.”\n • Therefore Steve Ledbetter is the only person whose opportunity, access and unexplained dryness point irrevocably to guilt.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCynthia Peck, Megan Brewer, Josh Kesler, Steve Ledbetter\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nSteve Ledbetter\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBefore dawn—possibly late the previous evening—Steve Ledbetter entered the Ames building and remained on the 6th floor.  Because it had not yet begun to rain, his clothes stayed dry.\n\n07 : 13  A fierce storm begins; Steve is already safely inside.\n\n≈07 : 30  Trent Willis arrives very early for his 8 : 15 appointment.  Using the phone outside the elevator lobby he contacts Steve (not knowing Cynthia is out).  Steve lets him through the secure door and into Cynthia’s office, pretending to help.\n\n07 : 35-07 : 40  An argument flares over the contract.  In anger Steve snatches the decorative letter-opener from Cynthia’s desk, plunges it into Willis’s chest.  Willis fights back, knocking objects around the office, but collapses and dies.\n\n07 : 40  Leaving the body where it fell, Steve rides the elevator down and immediately comes back up, letting the security system record a “normal” 7 : 40 arrival—the entry that Whitmore later cites.\n\n07 : 51  Megan Brewer enters Cynthia’s office to prepare for the meeting and discovers the body.\n\n08 : 35  Cynthia at last returns; the investigation starts.  Steve, completely dry in spite of the deluge, explains that his chauffeur “lets me out right at the front door,” hoping no one will notice the impossibility of remaining dry without a coat or umbrella.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Cynthia Peck – Building log, mobile-phone tower records and her soaked clothing all verify that she was off-site during the window in which Willis was killed.\n\n• Megan Brewer – She had access, but she was on the floor continuously from 6 : 59 to 7 : 51 except for a quick coffee run; during most of the crucial interval Steve and/or Josh were present.  Being bone-dry is consistent with arriving before the storm.\n\n• Josh Kesler – He arrived after the rain started and necessarily used his umbrella, accounting for his condition; no direct access to the office unless he stole a key during Megan’s coffee break, but that window was before he arrived.  Nothing contradicted his story.\n\nOnly Steve Ledbetter’s account conflicts with inescapable physical evidence (the torrential rain), and only he had to fabricate an arrival time to conceal his presence during the murder.  Therefore he is the sole killer.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Megan Brewer became pale and Whitmore was concerned she may faint. Gently, he asked, “Why did you do it?\nBarely audible, she asked, “How did you know? I thought with the cameras and monitors out I was safe from discovery.”\n“Process of elimination,” the detective answered. “First, we know Mr. Willis was killed before 7:13, because he had no umbrella or raincoat with him. That places him in the office sometime between 6:45 when Ms. Peck arrived and 7:13 when the rains hit. I know your boss is not the murderer because she is so confident of her cell phone trail she gave me her phone without asking. Mr. Kesler didn’t do it because he has a wet umbrella in his office – proving he got here after the rain began at 7:13, which I knew to be true before Ms. Peck told us. Although Mr. Ledbetter has no coat, umbrella or anything else to prove his innocence, his arrival time was 7:40. Now, in case you are wondering, yes; arrival times can be faked. But, it is very doubtful that a man of Mr. Ledbetter’s age and physical condition could overpower a younger, muscular man. So – it was you, Ms. Brewer. I believe Mr. Willis arrived early. You met him at the front at the door and escorted him up. You escorted him into Ms. Peck’s office. What I don’t know is, why did you kill him?\nMegan felt sick to her stomach and willed herself to stay calm. Softly, she said, “Mr. Willis has been in our office several times. I knew he had his eye on me. I was suspicious of his intentions when I found him waiting for me at the door when I arrived. I escorted him into Cindy’s office and he tried to attack me. I didn’t know what to do. We wrestled around for a few moments. Fortunately, I saw the letter carrier on Cindy’s desk and grabbed it. In desperation I stabbed him in the heart. I didn’t mean to kill him, but I panicked after I saw he was dead.”\nDead silence enveloped the room. Finally, she asked, “What will you do with me?\nWhitmore answered, “Well, we have to arrest you, but I would guess your story will check out. I believe the judge will be very lenient with a frightened person who panicked after an act of desperation.”",

      "mystery_text": "It was 8:35 A.M. and Cynthia Peck was not only in a bad mood but late for work as well, which was most unusual for her. Not only was she late, but rain had been coming down in a torrential downpour since 7:13. She knew it was 7:13 because that is what the digital clock in her automobile reflected as the first thick raindrops splattered her windshield. As she entered the Ames building, she cursed silently that her oversized umbrella had done a poor job of keeping her dry. But, today, it was probably good that she was late, for it could possibly be herself that her administrative assistant, Megan Brewer, found dead on the floor of her spacious office. Cynthia Peck was 37 years old and a vice president of the Ames Marketing Company. She did not become a company vice president by being weak or faint hearted. She knew something was wrong as she exited the sixth floor elevator and met several uniformed police officers waiting for her to arrive. Before the officers had a chance to say anything to her, she asked, “What is going on?” Detective Sergeant Kyle Whitmore answered, “Are you Cynthia Peck?” “Yes,’ she replied and asked again, “What’s going on?” “There is a dead man in your office. Your assistant, Ms. Brewer, found him this morning. Identification in his wallet shows him to be Mr. Trent Willis. Do you know him?” Cynthia showed no emotion as she answered, “Yes, we had a meeting in my office scheduled for this morning. What happened?” “He was murdered,” the detective answered, watching Cynthia carefully, and added, “he has a letter opener in his chest. The only belongings we found were his cell phone and briefcase.” The detective did not share with her the fact that the state of her office indicated the powerfully built Willis, whose driver’s license showed him to be 35 years old, put up a violent but futile struggle with his attacker. Cynthia now felt a slight dizziness. Small beads of perspiration broke out upon her high forehead as she asked, without visible emotion, “Who did it?” “We don’t know yet,” Sergeant Whitmore answered, noticing the wetness on Cynthia’s clothing. He pointed towards the end of the hall and said, “Please join us in the conference room after taking a moment to dry off.” “Thank you,” she gratefully replied. Upon entering the conference room, Cynthia saw that her assistant, Megan Brewer, was already seated along with her boss, company president Steve Ledbetter and a member of her marketing team, Josh Kesler. She quickly took a seat and noted that a uniformed policeman stood at the door. Anyone wishing to enter or exit the room would have to do so through the officer. The four Ames employees looked expectantly at Sergeant Whitmore. Whitmore silently noted to himself that the Ames employees, with the exception of Steve Ledbetter, appeared to be between 35-40 years old and in good physical condition. President Ledbetter was the exception, being 58 years old and at least 50 pounds overweight. He began to speak, “Ms. Brewer found the victim at 7:51 this morning. Mr. Willis, as you know, Ms. Peck, had an 8:15 appointment to see you. Ms. Brewer claims not to know how he got to the sixth floor and into the office. I know that I do not need to tell you that the stairways are locked and a pass code is needed to exit the elevator on the sixth floor. Now, Ms. Peck and Ms. Brewer are the only persons with a passkey into Ms. Peck’s office, but Ms. Brewer informs us that she left her passkey on her outer office desk for a few moments while in the break room getting a cup of coffee. Security tells us that four persons accessed the sixth floor before 7:51.” Whitmore stopped for a moment to catch his breath and, with a sweeping motion of his hand, added, “And those persons are all of you. Before anyone asks, records show Ms. Peck exited the elevator at 6:45, a little over an hour before Mr. Trent was discovered.” “It’s true, Sergeant. Stupidly, I left the signed contract I was to give to Mr. Willis at home. I had to return home and get it.” The sergeant looked at Cynthia and said, “OK, for now. What security shows is that Ms. Peck arrived at 6:45, and Ms. Brewer was next at 6:59. At 7:25, Mr. Kesler arrived. Mr. Ledbetter was last to arrive at 7:40.” Sgt. Whitmore paused and looked at each of them in turn before adding, “It’s highly unlikely that somebody hid overnight on the sixth floor, but we’re checking security cameras as I speak. What is much more likely is that one of you murdered Trent Willis.” Megan felt faint and began to weep. Softly, Sgt. Whitmore said to her, “I’m sorry, Ms. Brewer, this is unpleasant but necessary. Steve Ledbetter asked, “Why not check the cameras to see when Mr. Willis entered?” “Because lightning knocked them out early this morning, before the rains hit,” was the sergeant’s reply. Turning to Cynthia, he said, “Let’s begin with you, Ms. Peck. You first arrived at 6:45. Did you enter your office?” “Yes. It was then that I discovered that I left the contract at home. I left to retrieve it.” “Security shows you left the sixth floor at 6:49,” Whitmore noted, “That’s right,” Cynthia answered. “So it took you an hour and 46 minutes to get back here?” Whitmore asked. “Right again. The rain hit at 7:13 by my car radio and traffic crawled to a stop. I was in my car the entire time, except for the short time I was in my apartment retrieving the contract.” Cynthia thought for a moment as Whitmore’s eyes bored into her and then added, “I made several cell phone calls from my car, one of them around 7:10 to the newspaper delivery service, one to my husband’s office around 7:35 and another just after 8:00 to my doctor’s office. Telephone company records will show my cell phone to be a long way from here between shortly after leaving until after 8:15 or so.” As she said this, she handed Sgt. Whitmore her cell phone. Whitmore thanked her and turned to Cynthia’s assistant, Megan Brewer, who had composed herself. He stated, “You exited the elevator at 6:59. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you arrived?” “Nothing. I noticed the lightning outside the windows but that is all.” Thinking for a moment, he asked, “Did Ms. Peck call you at anytime after leaving to return home? “No, but that is not unusual. She only calls when she needs to. This morning, she sent an email before leaving, explaining the situation and asking me to make Mr. Willis comfortable.” Whitmore turned to Josh Kesler and asked, “What about you? You got here at 7:25. Did you see or hear anything out of the ordinary?” “No,” was his response. Did you make any calls on your cell phone or from the office; anything that can prove you are not the killer?” Nervously, Josh replied, “No, nothing.” Whitmore thought for a long moment, and then asked Steve Ledbetter. “Do you have a raincoat?” “Yes, but I do not have it with me. As president of the company, I have a car and driver at my disposal. Maurice always lets me out right at the front door so I never wear a coat.” Turning back to Josh Kesler, “And you? Do you have a raincoat?” Josh was puzzled but answered, “No, but I have an umbrella. If you want to see it, it’s drying in my office.” Sergeant Whitmore had seen a lot in his 12 years as a homicide investigator, but never anything as bizarre as this. Pointing to the murderer, he said to the officer guarding the door, “Arrest this person for second degree murder.”",

      "outcome": "Megan Brewer became pale and Whitmore was concerned she may faint. Gently, he asked, “Why did you do it?\nBarely audible, she asked, “How did you know? I thought with the cameras and monitors out I was safe from discovery.”\n“Process of elimination,” the detective answered. “First, we know Mr. Willis was killed before 7:13, because he had no umbrella or raincoat with him. That places him in the office sometime between 6:45 when Ms. Peck arrived and 7:13 when the rains hit. I know your boss is not the murderer because she is so confident of her cell phone trail she gave me her phone without asking. Mr. Kesler didn’t do it because he has a wet umbrella in his office – proving he got here after the rain began at 7:13, which I knew to be true before Ms. Peck told us. Although Mr. Ledbetter has no coat, umbrella or anything else to prove his innocence, his arrival time was 7:40. Now, in case you are wondering, yes; arrival times can be faked. But, it is very doubtful that a man of Mr. Ledbetter’s age and physical condition could overpower a younger, muscular man. So – it was you, Ms. Brewer. I believe Mr. Willis arrived early. You met him at the front at the door and escorted him up. You escorted him into Ms. Peck’s office.
