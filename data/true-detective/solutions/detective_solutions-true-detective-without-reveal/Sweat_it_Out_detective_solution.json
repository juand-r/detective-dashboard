    "full_text": "Rubbernecking is a dangerous sport. I should know, because I just about hit a cop on my drive to the racket club. There was a traffic accident on the corner of Main and King, blocking the entrance to the Java Hut. The ornate “Open” sign inside the Java Hut window taunted me -- if I could just get past the yellow barricades, I thought. As I surveyed the wreckage, mourning the loss of my morning coffee, I almost missed the fact that the streetlight had changed from green to red. As I slammed on the breaks, with my car stopping inches from a police officer crossing the road, I knew that I was in big trouble. Fortunately, I got off with just a warning. The police officer came to my window and glared at me. “You should keep your eyes on the road,” he said. “Sorry, officer,” I said. “I’ll be more careful in the future. But if you don’t mind my asking, what happened here?” “Yes, I do mind,” he said, and strode off just before the light turned green. I resisted the urge to sneak another glance at the accident scene, but my curiosity was fulfilled later. Anyway ... when I arrived at the racket club, I felt like calling that police officer to help me out because the club’s patrons had to pay for parking, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s just criminal (especially considering that I know how much my cousin Dave Perkins paid in membership dues). And it wasn’t even a flat fee for parking, they gave you a time-stamped ticket and you had to pay for every quarter hour segment of your stay on your way out. It didn’t seem to bother my cousin, though. When I entered the club’s lobby, Dave was waiting for me on a leather couch drinking a cup of Java Hut coffee. He looked relaxed. “Don’t get too comfortable,” I said. I pointed at the clock -- it was 9:50 a.m. “Our court time is in ten minutes. And that means you’ll be losing in exactly eleven minutes ...” “Are you sure you’re up for this?” Dave asked. “You haven’t played squash in years.” “I beat you when we were teenagers, and I’ll beat you now,” I said. “Loser buys lunch,” he said. Good thing I brought my credit card. I lost -- badly -- and I had a sinking suspicion that Dave would order the club’s most expensive bottle of wine. But first we decided to hit the steam room. My aching muscles needed it. Dave’s co-workers from the Water Works plumbing company, Larry Douglas and Chris Henderson, were already in the steam room when we arrived after our half-hour session on the squash court. “I squashed Larry,” Chris gloated after Dave introduced me. “Did you take care of Dave?” “Well,” I said, embarrassed. “I, uh--” “He was off his game because he didn’t have his morning coffee,” Dave said, coming to my rescue. “Java Hut was—“ “Big deal,” Chris said, “Java Hut was closed when I drove by, too. I beat Larry with un-caffeinated skill.” “That’s because I was half asleep from waiting for you so long on that comfy couch out front,” Larry said. “I wondered why you were still in here,” Dave said. “I thought you had a 9:30 court time.” “We did, but we didn’t end up starting until 9:45. Good thing you guys booked a different court number. There was nobody on ours after us, so we played until nearly 10:30. Besides, he only beat me by--” “Never mind your scores,” said Nathan Elliot as he entered the steam room. “We’ve got more important things to talk about.” Water Works’ owner stood at the door with his arms crossed. Unlike the rest of us, he wasn’t dressed in just a large towel; he wore a three-piece suit. He looked very uncomfortable as the steam caused him to sweat instantly. But it was my turn to feel uncomfortable when he turned his focus on me. His eyes narrowed. “Who are you?” he demanded. “I’m Dave’s cousin, Rick,” I said, trying my best to sound friendly in deference to not causing Dave any problems. “I believe I took your place on the squash court today.” “That’s right,” Nathan said. “I wasn’t supposed to be here” He looked down at his suit, “Obviously. I left my niece’s wedding to fire one of you!” All three of his employees sat bolt upright, suddenly on edge. I, too, felt the stress of the situation, despite not being at any personal risk. Then again, I was at risk of passing out from too much steam. Nathan, who for all intents and purposes was blocking the exit, said, “I’m not moving until I find out who caused that accident at Main and King.” “What makes you think it was one of us?” Chris asked. “Witnesses all described our Water Works vans. No one caught the license plate, but it had to be one of you three.” “Or you,” I said. I was no longer worried about being friendly. If he was the culprit and he was trying to frame my cousin, then Dave would have a lot more to worry about than losing his job. And I have to admit, that if Dave was guilty, the thought of providing an alibi for him did cross my mind. But only momentarily. Do the crime, do the time, I always say. “I didn’t drive my van to the wedding -- while I normally love getting the company logo in front of as many eyeballs as possible, my wife would never step foot in that van in an expensive gown,” Nathan said. “What time did the accident happen?” Larry asked. “Around 9:35.” “I got here at 8:30,” Larry said, “I have a ticket on my dash.” “Did anyone see you?” Nathan asked. “Well, no, but ... why don’t you just go look at our vans,” Larry said. “Mine’s in the parking lot and it’ll be obvious from looking at it that it hasn’t been in any accidents.” “I didn’t say any of you idiots were in an accident,” Nathan said, losing his temper as his suit clung tighter to his sweat-soaked body. “One of you ran a red light. A car that had the right of way swerved to avoid you and smashed into another car. Nobody died, thank God, but I’m sure the police are going to want to talk to whichever one of you walks out of here unemployed ...” “Go ahead and call the police, I said. “I know who caused the accident.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Fix the time of the accident  \n   • Nathan says the red-light violation that caused the pile-up happened “around 9:35.”  \n   • When Rick (the narrator) reached the intersection a few minutes later the police were already there, so 9:35 ± a minute or two is solid.\n\n2. Where was every Water Works employee at 9 : 35?  \n   • Dave Perkins – Already sitting in the racket-club lobby with a cup of Java Hut coffee when Rick arrived at 9:50.  \n     He could only have obtained that coffee before 9:35, i.e. before the accident blocked\n     the entrance. Therefore Dave had to have reached the club well before 9:35.  \n   • Larry Douglas – Says he parked at 8:30 and still had the same (time-stamped) parking\n     ticket on his dashboard. If true, leaving the lot and coming back would have produced a new ticket, so the 8:30 ticket is a strong alibi that keeps him in the club at 9:35.  \n   • Chris Henderson – Was supposed to start a match with Larry at 9:30, but they “didn’t end up starting until 9:45,” meaning Chris did not reach the club until just before 9:45. Therefore at 9:35 he was still on the road.  \n   • Nathan Elliot – Arrived from his niece’s wedding in a private car, not a Water Works van. Eyewitnesses all reported a *van* with the company logo. Nathan therefore does not match the description.\n\n3. Whose statements clash with observable facts?  \n   • Chris said “Java Hut was closed when I drove by.” Rick, who reached the scene shortly after the crash, saw the glowing OPEN sign; the shop wasn’t closed—access was blocked by police barricades put there *because of the accident*. Chris’s mistake is exactly what someone who arrived *after* the crash—but who didn’t stop—would think.  \n   • Dave’s and Larry’s remarks fit what Rick himself observed.\n\n4. Opportunity + motive  \n   • Only Chris was (a) still driving at 9:35, (b) driving a company van, and (c) in a hurry—he was already late for his 9:30 court time. Hurrying to make up lost time is an obvious reason to run the light.  \n   • No one else had both the chance and the means.\n\nConclusion: Chris Henderson is the driver who ran the red light. No one helped him, so there are no accomplices.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDave Perkins, Larry Douglas, Chris Henderson, Nathan Elliot\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nChris Henderson\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nChris Henderson left for his 9:30 squash game late, speeding toward the racket\nclub in a Water Works plumbing van. At 9:35 a.m. he reached the intersection of\nMain and King. Trying to beat the light, he shot through the red signal. A car\nwith the right-of-way swerved to avoid his van and collided with another\nvehicle, creating the pile-up Rick later saw blocking the entrance to Java Hut.\nChris, probably unaware of the full extent of the damage behind him and afraid\nto stop, kept driving. He reached the club a few minutes before 9:45, parked,\ngrabbed his gear, and began his match with Larry at 9:45—as Larry’s account\nconfirms. In the steam room Chris inadvertently revealed he had passed the\nintersection after the crash (“Java Hut was closed when I drove by”) while Dave\ncould only have been there beforehand (he still had Java Hut coffee). Nathan’s\ntimeline and Larry’s parking-ticket alibi exclude them, leaving Chris as the\nonly possible culprit.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Dave Perkins – His possession of Java Hut coffee after the intersection was\nblocked proves he visited the shop *before* the 9:35 accident and therefore was\nalready at the club when it happened.  \n• Larry Douglas – His 8:30 parking-lot time-stamp shows he never left the club\nlot; leaving would have generated a new ticket. He was waiting for Chris at\n9:35.  \n• Nathan Elliot – Witnesses saw a Water Works van, but Nathan drove his private\ncar to the wedding and arrived at the club in formal wear. He had neither the\nvehicle nor the opportunity to be at Main and King at 9:35.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I left my niece’s wedding to fire one of you!” All three of his employees sat bolt upright, suddenly on edge. I, too, felt the stress of the situation, despite not being at any personal risk. Then again, I was at risk of passing out from too much steam. Nathan, who for all intents and purposes was blocking the exit, said, “I’m not moving until I find out who caused that accident at Main and King.” “What makes you think it was one of us?” Chris asked. “Witnesses all described our Water Works vans. No one caught the license plate, but it had to be one of you three.” “Or you,” I said. I was no longer worried about being friendly. If he was the culprit and he was trying to frame my cousin, then Dave would have a lot more to worry about than losing his job. And I have to admit, that if Dave was guilty, the thought of providing an alibi for him did cross my mind. But only momentarily. Do the crime, do the time, I always say. “I didn’t drive my van to the wedding -- while I normally love getting the company logo in front of as many eyeballs as possible, my wife would never step foot in that van in an expensive gown,” Nathan said. “What time did the accident happen?” Larry asked. “Around 9:35.” “I got here at 8:30,” Larry said, “I have a ticket on my dash.” “Did anyone see you?” Nathan asked. “Well, no, but ... why don’t you just go look at our vans,” Larry said. “Mine’s in the parking lot and it’ll be obvious from looking at it that it hasn’t been in any accidents.” “I didn’t say any of you idiots were in an accident,” Nathan said, losing his temper as his suit clung tighter to his sweat-soaked body. “One of you ran a red light. A car that had the right of way swerved to avoid you and smashed into another car. Nobody died, thank God, but I’m sure the police are going to want to talk to whichever one of you walks out of here unemployed ...” “Go ahead and call the police, I said. “I know who caused the accident.”",

      "answer": "(a) Chris Henderson",
      "outcome": "“Well, out with it!” Nathan exclaimed. “Or I’ll lock you all in here until the police come.”\n“I’m guessing there are enough guests at the wedding who can confirm your alibi.” I said.\n“Yes,” Nathan said impatiently.\n“And Larry’s got the proof of his innocence on his van’s dashboard,” I said, proud of my detective skills.\n“Oh, yeah!” Larry exclaimed. “I got one of those parking meter tickets at 8:30.”\n“And I don’t know if you noticed,” Mr. Elliott, “but the accident blocked off access to the Java Hut. When I got here, Dave was drinking a fresh Java Hut coffee, so obviously he was at Main and King before the accident happened.”\nChris jumped up. Being the only suspect unaccounted for, he looked ready to attack me. “This is crazy. You have no proof. I told you the Java Hut was closed when I went by, so obviously the accident had already happened.”\n“But the Java Hut wasn’t closed,” I said. “That’s how I knew you were lying. The sign still said, ‘open’, and the employees were still visible watching from inside the shop, I just couldn’t get to them.”\n“We play squash every weekend, Chris,” Larry said reproachfully. “It wouldn’t have been a big deal if we lost our court time today. And it turned out there wasn’t even anyone after us ...”\n“It wasn’t red!” Chris said. “It was orange. That other car couldn’t have had a green light yet.”\n“Lots of witnesses say otherwise,” Nathan said. “Chris ... you’re fired.”\nThen Nathan finally let us out of the steam room. Once we were in the locker room, he grinned at me, and said, “You need a job?”\nDave laughed. “Rick’s plumbing skills are worse than his squash skills, and that’s saying something.” Everyone laughed, except Chris. Then Dave turned to me and said, “Now, about that lunch ...”"
