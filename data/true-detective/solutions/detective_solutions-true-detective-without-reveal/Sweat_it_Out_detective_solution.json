    "full_text": "Rubbernecking is a dangerous sport. I should know, because I just about hit a cop on my drive to the racket club. There was a traffic accident on the corner of Main and King, blocking the entrance to the Java Hut. The ornate “Open” sign inside the Java Hut window taunted me -- if I could just get past the yellow barricades, I thought. As I surveyed the wreckage, mourning the loss of my morning coffee, I almost missed the fact that the streetlight had changed from green to red. As I slammed on the breaks, with my car stopping inches from a police officer crossing the road, I knew that I was in big trouble. Fortunately, I got off with just a warning. The police officer came to my window and glared at me. “You should keep your eyes on the road,” he said. “Sorry, officer,” I said. “I’ll be more careful in the future. But if you don’t mind my asking, what happened here?” “Yes, I do mind,” he said, and strode off just before the light turned green. I resisted the urge to sneak another glance at the accident scene, but my curiosity was fulfilled later. Anyway ... when I arrived at the racket club, I felt like calling that police officer to help me out because the club’s patrons had to pay for parking, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s just criminal (especially considering that I know how much my cousin Dave Perkins paid in membership dues). And it wasn’t even a flat fee for parking, they gave you a time-stamped ticket and you had to pay for every quarter hour segment of your stay on your way out. It didn’t seem to bother my cousin, though. When I entered the club’s lobby, Dave was waiting for me on a leather couch drinking a cup of Java Hut coffee. He looked relaxed. “Don’t get too comfortable,” I said. I pointed at the clock -- it was 9:50 a.m. “Our court time is in ten minutes. And that means you’ll be losing in exactly eleven minutes ...” “Are you sure you’re up for this?” Dave asked. “You haven’t played squash in years.” “I beat you when we were teenagers, and I’ll beat you now,” I said. “Loser buys lunch,” he said. Good thing I brought my credit card. I lost -- badly -- and I had a sinking suspicion that Dave would order the club’s most expensive bottle of wine. But first we decided to hit the steam room. My aching muscles needed it. Dave’s co-workers from the Water Works plumbing company, Larry Douglas and Chris Henderson, were already in the steam room when we arrived after our half-hour session on the squash court. “I squashed Larry,” Chris gloated after Dave introduced me. “Did you take care of Dave?” “Well,” I said, embarrassed. “I, uh--” “He was off his game because he didn’t have his morning coffee,” Dave said, coming to my rescue. “Java Hut was—“ “Big deal,” Chris said, “Java Hut was closed when I drove by, too. I beat Larry with un-caffeinated skill.” “That’s because I was half asleep from waiting for you so long on that comfy couch out front,” Larry said. “I wondered why you were still in here,” Dave said. “I thought you had a 9:30 court time.” “We did, but we didn’t end up starting until 9:45. Good thing you guys booked a different court number. There was nobody on ours after us, so we played until nearly 10:30. Besides, he only beat me by--” “Never mind your scores,” said Nathan Elliot as he entered the steam room. “We’ve got more important things to talk about.” Water Works’ owner stood at the door with his arms crossed. Unlike the rest of us, he wasn’t dressed in just a large towel; he wore a three-piece suit. He looked very uncomfortable as the steam caused him to sweat instantly. But it was my turn to feel uncomfortable when he turned his focus on me. His eyes narrowed. “Who are you?” he demanded. “I’m Dave’s cousin, Rick,” I said, trying my best to sound friendly in deference to not causing Dave any problems. “I believe I took your place on the squash court today.” “That’s right,” Nathan said. “I wasn’t supposed to be here” He looked down at his suit, “Obviously. I left my niece’s wedding to fire one of you!” All three of his employees sat bolt upright, suddenly on edge. I, too, felt the stress of the situation, despite not being at any personal risk. Then again, I was at risk of passing out from too much steam. Nathan, who for all intents and purposes was blocking the exit, said, “I’m not moving until I find out who caused that accident at Main and King.” “What makes you think it was one of us?” Chris asked. “Witnesses all described our Water Works vans. No one caught the license plate, but it had to be one of you three.” “Or you,” I said. I was no longer worried about being friendly. If he was the culprit and he was trying to frame my cousin, then Dave would have a lot more to worry about than losing his job. And I have to admit, that if Dave was guilty, the thought of providing an alibi for him did cross my mind. But only momentarily. Do the crime, do the time, I always say. “I didn’t drive my van to the wedding -- while I normally love getting the company logo in front of as many eyeballs as possible, my wife would never step foot in that van in an expensive gown,” Nathan said. “What time did the accident happen?” Larry asked. “Around 9:35.” “I got here at 8:30,” Larry said, “I have a ticket on my dash.” “Did anyone see you?” Nathan asked. “Well, no, but ... why don’t you just go look at our vans,” Larry said. “Mine’s in the parking lot and it’ll be obvious from looking at it that it hasn’t been in any accidents.” “I didn’t say any of you idiots were in an accident,” Nathan said, losing his temper as his suit clung tighter to his sweat-soaked body. “One of you ran a red light. A car that had the right of way swerved to avoid you and smashed into another car. Nobody died, thank God, but I’m sure the police are going to want to talk to whichever one of you walks out of here unemployed ...” “Go ahead and call the police, I said. “I know who caused the accident.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Fix the time of the crash.  \n   •  Nathan, who has already talked to the police, tells us the accident happened “…around 9:35.”\n\n2. Work out where every Water Works employee was at 9 : 35.\n\n   a)  Larry Douglas  \n       –  Says he drove in at 8 : 30 and still has the entry-ticket on his dashboard.  \n       –  With a ticket-gate system you can’t get out again without paying first, so if the ticket in his van shows 8 : 30 he never left the car-park.  \n       –  Dave later remembers seeing Larry dozing on the lobby couch while Chris was still on his way.  \n       →  Larry was already inside the club at 9 : 35.  He had no opportunity.\n\n   b)  Dave Perkins  \n       –  Rick meets Dave at 9 : 50, already sitting in the lobby with a cup of Java Hut coffee.  \n       –  So Dave must have arrived well before 9 : 50 – early enough to buy coffee before the crash, park, change clothes and wait for his cousin.  \n       –  Nothing puts Dave on the road at 9 : 35; in fact, having time to relax with coffee shows he was **not** rushing anywhere then.  \n       →  Dave had no need to speed through a red light.\n\n   c)  Chris Henderson  \n       –  Larry and Chris had a 9 : 30 court but “didn’t end up starting until 9 : 45” because Chris was late.  \n       –  To walk on court at 9 : 45 Chris must have reached the club only a minute or two earlier – i.e. he was driving past Main & King at roughly 9 : 35.  \n       –  Chris himself says “Java Hut was closed when I drove by, too.”  \n            •  Rick, who came along about five minutes AFTER the crash, saw the big “OPEN” sign still glowing in the window.  \n            •  If the sign still said OPEN, the shop certainly didn’t look “closed” – unless you were describing the *entrance* being blocked by police tape **that you had just caused**.  \n       →  Chris is the only one proved to be on the road at the exact time and place of the offence, and he was hurrying because he was already fifteen minutes late.\n\n3. Motive.  \n   •  Larry was already early; Dave was relaxed and early; Chris was late and under pressure to get to the club for the 9 : 30 booking.  \n   •  Rushing to make up time is the only real motive anyone had for risking a red light.\n\n4. Physical evidence / alibis.  \n   •  Larry’s 8 : 30 parking ticket keeps him inside the car-park.  \n   •  Dave’s coffee and settled position in the lobby before 9 : 50 shows he arrived long before the crash.  \n   •  Chris has no alibi and actually places himself at the scene with his own words.\n\n5. Logical deduction.  \n   Only one Water Works van could be passing Main & King at 9 : 35.  \n   The only employee who was demonstrably on the road at that moment – and who had a reason to hurry – is Chris Henderson.  \n   Therefore Chris is the driver who ran the red light and triggered the pile-up.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDave Perkins, Larry Douglas, Chris Henderson, Nathan Elliot\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nChris Henderson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nChris Henderson overslept and was running late for his 9 : 30 squash match with Larry Douglas.  \nAt 9 : 35, speeding north on Main Street in his Water Works van, Chris tried to beat the light at King Street.  \nThe signal turned red; Chris blasted straight through.  \nA car that legitimately had the green swerved to avoid the van and slammed into another car, blocking the entrance to the Java Hut coffee shop.  \nChris, rattled and already late, kept going and reached the racket club a few minutes later.  \nBecause of the delay he and Larry did not start their game until 9 : 45.  \nIn the steam room Chris unwittingly gave himself away by insisting that “Java Hut was closed when I drove by” – a description that only made sense to someone who had seen the police tape and barricades that appeared *after* the crash he had caused.  \nThe other Water Works employees were all at the club long before the accident and could not have been driving the van at 9 : 35.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Larry Douglas – His parking-lot entry ticket shows 8 : 30, and he was seen dozing in the lobby while waiting for Chris; the car-park’s barrier system makes it practically impossible for him to have left and returned without paying and getting a new ticket.  \n\n•  Dave Perkins – Already seated in the lobby with Java Hut coffee when Rick arrived at 9 : 50.  He clearly reached the club well before 9 : 35 and had no need to hurry anywhere at that time.  \n\n•  Nathan Elliot – Attending his niece’s wedding in a formal suit and, by his own account, in a private vehicle, not a Water Works van, during the morning.  No opportunity, and witnesses described a company van, not a private car.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Unlike the rest of us, he wasn’t dressed in just a large towel; he wore a three-piece suit. He looked very uncomfortable as the steam caused him to sweat instantly. But it was my turn to feel uncomfortable when he turned his focus on me. His eyes narrowed. “Who are you?” he demanded. “I’m Dave’s cousin, Rick,” I said, trying my best to sound friendly in deference to not causing Dave any problems. “I believe I took your place on the squash court today.” “That’s right,” Nathan said. “I wasn’t supposed to be here” He looked down at his suit, “Obviously. I left my niece’s wedding to fire one of you!” All three of his employees sat bolt upright, suddenly on edge. I, too, felt the stress of the situation, despite not being at any personal risk. Then again, I was at risk of passing out from too much steam. Nathan, who for all intents and purposes was blocking the exit, said, “I’m not moving until I find out who caused that accident at Main and King.” “What makes you think it was one of us?” Chris asked. “Witnesses all described our Water Works vans. No one caught the license plate, but it had to be one of you three.” “Or you,” I said. I was no longer worried about being friendly. If he was the culprit and he was trying to frame my cousin, then Dave would have a lot more to worry about than losing his job. And I have to admit, that if Dave was guilty, the thought of providing an alibi for him did cross my mind. But only momentarily. Do the crime, do the time, I always say. “I didn’t drive my van to the wedding -- while I normally love getting the company logo in front of as many eyeballs as possible, my wife would never step foot in that van in an expensive gown,” Nathan said. “What time did the accident happen?” Larry asked. “Around 9:35.” “I got here at 8:30,” Larry said, “I have a ticket on my dash.” “Did anyone see you?” Nathan asked. “Well, no, but ... why don’t you just go look at our vans,” Larry said. “Mine’s in the parking lot and it’ll be obvious from looking at it that it hasn’t been in any accidents.” “I didn’t say any of you idiots were in an accident,” Nathan said, losing his temper as his suit clung tighter to his sweat-soaked body. “One of you ran a red light. A car that had the right of way swerved to avoid you and smashed into another car. Nobody died, thank God, but I’m sure the police are going to want to talk to whichever one of you walks out of here unemployed ...” “Go ahead and call the police, I said. “I know who caused the accident.”",

      "answer": "(a) Chris Henderson",
      "outcome": "“Well, out with it!” Nathan exclaimed. “Or I’ll lock you all in here until the police come.”\n“I’m guessing there are enough guests at the wedding who can confirm your alibi.” I said.\n“Yes,” Nathan said impatiently.\n“And Larry’s got the proof of his innocence on his van’s dashboard,” I said, proud of my detective skills.\n“Oh, yeah!” Larry exclaimed. “I got one of those parking meter tickets at 8:30.”\n“And I don’t know if you noticed,” Mr. Elliott, “but the accident blocked off access to the Java Hut. When I got here, Dave was drinking a fresh Java Hut coffee, so obviously he was at Main and King before the accident happened.”\nChris jumped up. Being the only suspect unaccounted for, he looked ready to attack me. “This is crazy. You have no proof. I told you the Java Hut was closed when I went by, so obviously the accident had already happened.”\n“But the Java Hut wasn’t closed,” I said. “That’s how I knew you were lying. The sign still said, ‘open’, and the employees were still visible watching from inside the shop, I just couldn’t get to them.”\n“We play squash every weekend, Chris,” Larry said reproachfully. “It wouldn’t have been a big deal if we lost our court time today. And it turned out there wasn’t even anyone after us ...”\n“It wasn’t red!” Chris said. “It was orange. That other car couldn’t have had a green light yet.”\n“Lots of witnesses say otherwise,” Nathan said. “Chris ... you’re fired.”\nThen Nathan finally let us out of the steam room. Once we were in the locker room, he grinned at me, and said, “You need a job?”\nDave laughed. “Rick’s plumbing skills are worse than his squash skills, and that’s saying something.” Everyone laughed, except Chris. Then Dave turned to me and said, “Now, about that lunch ...”"
