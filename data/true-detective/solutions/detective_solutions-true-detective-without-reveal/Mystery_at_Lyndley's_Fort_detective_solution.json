    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  We look for the person who could (a) want the gate opened for the attacking Tories, (b) have enough time to undo the very tight knots that Nate tied, and (c) whose testimony contains a clear falsehood or suspicious omission.\n\n2.  Difficulty of the task  \n   Nate states:  \n   “My knots are tied very tight.  \n    It could take you through the night  \n    To untangle what I'd done …”  \n   A single quick tug would not loosen them; it would take many minutes—probably hours—of steady work with two good hands.\n\n3.  Time-table of the four guards (in the order they stood the watch):  \n   • John – from late afternoon until “daylight was gone.”  \n   • John’s wife – only the last hour of John’s watch; she left “just past supper time.”  \n   • Bo – from early nightfall until 2 a.m.; he cannot use his left hand.  \n   • Nathan Drew – the relief for John; he says he “guarded them through dawn,” i.e., the long, solitary shift from about 2 a.m. until daylight.\n\n4.  What Nate discovers  \n   The ropes are found untied at dusk.  That means the cutting/untangling had to be finished earlier, yet after John’s wife had already left the post, so the saboteur’s shift must have lasted many continuous, quiet hours.\n\n5.  Testing each person\n   • John – worked only until dusk, but his wife followed him and still saw the knots intact.  Not enough time afterwards for John to finish the long job.  \n   • John’s wife – on duty just one hour, had witnesses coming and going, and the ropes were still tight when she left.  Not enough time.  \n   • Bo – has only one workable hand and was relieved at 2 a.m.; it is improbable he could single-handedly (literally) loosen several tight military knots before his shift ended.  \n   • Nathan Drew – a complete stranger to the settlement; on watch alone for the many hours needed; healthy and strong enough to work both hands; and he freely admits he “didn’t check” the knots at all.  He is the only one whose opportunity, ability, and vague testimony fit the facts.\n\n6.  Motive  \n   The poem stresses that Nathan Drew was “new to the village.”  A new arrival who suddenly volunteers for guard duty in wartime is the classic profile of an implanted Tory spy whose motive is to let the attackers in.\n\nTherefore, the logical deduction is that the liar—and thus the British spy—is Nathan Drew.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohn, John's wife, Bo, Nathan Drew\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nNathan Drew\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate in the afternoon Nate Lasher (the fort’s leader) lashed the main gate shut with several very tight knots.  \nJohn stood guard first, followed briefly by his wife; both saw the ropes exactly as Nate had left them.  \nBo took over after dusk, but, half-blind in the dark and hindered by his crippled left hand, he only kept watch for attackers and never touched the gate.  \nAt about 2 a.m. Nathan Drew—an unfamiliar newcomer who had ingratiated himself with the patriots—relieved Bo.  Alone for hours, he patiently worked at the ropes, finally loosening the main knot and cracking the gate open so that the Tories might stage a sudden rush.  \nJust before full dark on the following evening, Nate happened to re-inspect the walls and found the gate insecure.  He retied it immediately, then questioned every person who had stood guard.  \nBecause only Nathan possessed the uninterrupted hours, the physical ability, and (as an outsider) the motive to aid the enemy, Nate identified him as the spy who had untied the gate rope.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• John – Watched while the ropes were still tight; his wife’s independent testimony corroborates this.  \n• John’s wife – On duty only one hour and left the ropes untouched; too little time to undo a set of knots that require “through the night” to loosen.  \n• Bo – Had only one functional hand, worked a shorter shift, and was relieved long before the sabotage was discovered.  Even if he had wished to, he could not have labored long enough or deftly enough to unravel Nate’s knots.  \nThus all evidence—opportunity, capacity, motive, and the internal contradictions—points solely to Nathan Drew.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Rifle shots and arrows too\nHit the gates but couldn't get through. Past the walls, the forest sounds,\nfell silent to bullet pounds. \"Still this fort's walls will protect us\nfrom the Tories who'd eject us.\" Nate knew everyone inside\nwould have no place else to hide. It was dusk now. Still alone,\nhearing Tory rifles moan, Nate's eyes scanned their wooden shell.\nAs outside the gunshots fell. To his horror, on one wall --\nsomething could destroy them all. Where the wooden walls were stocked,\none strong gate had been unlocked! His strong knot had been undone.\nWho has done this? Who's the one? Quickly Nate retied its knot.\nStill outside, more guns were shot. He'd investigate this breach,\nseeking what its clues would teach. \"I tied rope there,\" he'd decide.\n\"Someone left this gate untied. If attackers found that gate\nOur defense would be too late. Round the men up -- there were four\nwho'd stood guard beside this door.\" One of them had told a lie.\nInside was a Tory spy! \"Is it you?\" Nate asked the first.\n\"Leaving us to face the worst?\" It's a frontiersman named John,\nwho'd watched till daylight was gone After Nate's first knots were tied\nlate that afternoon inside. John came forward, thin but proud,\nspeaking in a voice quite loud, Answering, his voice excited, \n\"I know we will stand united.\" John said he'd seen knots that day,\nand they hadn't gone away. \"Though my wife -- as it grew late -- \nstood my last hour at the gate.\" John's wife nodded. \"This is true.\nI saw several knots there too.\" \"It was just an hour, though.\nAfter that, I'd had to go. I could see the new moon climb.\nIt was just past supper time.\" Nate confronted suspect three,\na young man from Tennessee. It's a teenager named Bo.\n\"That's untied? I didn't know. As I started, it grew late. \nSoon I couldn't see that gate! I'd assumed the gates were closed.\"\nNate searched in the eyes of Bo's. \"Was it always in your sight?\nDid you watch it through the night?\" \"No,\" said Bo. \"No, just, till two.\nThat was all that I could do.\" \"Please,\" said Bo, \"I'm just a peasant\nSleepiness was so unpleasant. Usually I work by daylight\non my farm, and sleep by midnight! I've worked hard to till the land.\nSee these fingers on my hand?\" Bo's left hand was badly crippled.\nThrough its skin, sore bumps were rippled. Though he'd work his farm till night\nhe'd hoe dirt with just his right. The fourth guard was Nathan Drew.\nTo this village he was new. But he'd sought the company\nof those men who would be free. Men who glowed with freedom's light,\nstanding by them in their fight. He'd been the relief for John,\nand had guarded them through dawn. All the night, as hours passed\nand they heard each Tory blast, He'd stood sentry by the wall,\ntrusted to protect them all. \"For us all, I'd risk my neck.\nUntied knots? I didn't check.\" But now Nate surveyed the four,\nchecking what he'd thought before. \"England will no longer rule us.\nBut one liar tried to fool us.\" Summoning a final clue,\nhe revealed what he knew. \"My knots are tied very tight.\nIt could take you through the night To untangle what I'd done\nWhile you hid from everyone. Now I can unmask the spy \nwho stood here and told a lie!\" Where the Tories' fight was blocked\nwho had left their gate unlocked? Which suspect had told a lie?\nWhich suspect's a British spy?",
      "answer_options": "(a) Bo; (b) John; (c) John's wife; (d) Nathan Drew",
      "answer": "(d) Nathan Drew",
      "outcome": "\"British loyalties remained\nin one suspect,\" Nate explained.\n\"And, good Bo, it isn't you.\nIt's not something you could do.\nThough you're useful working lands,\nloosing knots would take two hands!\nAnd John didn't wish us ill.\nHis wife proved he's loyal still.\nWhile she heard the rifle shots,\nJohn's wife checked the gates for knots!\nAnd she's innocent -- it's true.\"\nNate revealed what he knew.\n\"Untying would take more power\nthan she had in just one hour.\"\nNate then looked around with pride\nat his countrymen inside.\nWho betrayed them? Nate now knew\nThat their spy was Nathan Drew.\nWhile the evening fight was fought\nNate was tying one more knot.\nFor their safety, now he'd tie\nbinding up their British spy.\nthinking how his skill with ropes\nkept alive their new-found hopes\nThat these 13 colonies\ncould retain their liberties.\nThough that first fight, by a river\nmade South Carolina quiver,\nAnd there followed years of war\nstruggling for rights - and more\nThey'd prevail with a cheer.\nAnd we celebrate each year."
