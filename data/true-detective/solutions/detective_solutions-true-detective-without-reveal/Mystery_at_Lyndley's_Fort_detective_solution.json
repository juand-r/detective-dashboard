I could see the new moon climb.\nIt was just past supper time.\" Nate confronted suspect three,\na young man from Tennessee. It's a teenager named Bo.\n\"That's untied? I didn't know. As I started, it grew late. \nSoon I couldn't see that gate! I'd assumed the gates were closed.\"\nNate searched in the eyes of Bo's. \"Was it always in your sight?\nDid you watch it through the night?\" \"No,\" said Bo. \"No, just, till two.\nThat was all that I could do.\" \"Please,\" said Bo, \"I'm just a peasant\nSleepiness was so unpleasant. Usually I work by daylight\non my farm, and sleep by midnight! I've worked hard to till the land.\nSee these fingers on my hand?\" Bo's left hand was badly crippled.\nThrough its skin, sore bumps were rippled.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could have done it?\n   – Only the four people who actually took turns at the gate:  \n      • John (frontiersman)  \n      • John’s wife (she replaced him for an hour)  \n      • Bo (the teenage farmer)  \n      • Nathan Drew (the newcomer)\n\n2. When was the rope found untied?\n   Nate discovered the loosened rope at dusk, only a short time after he had left the gate.  \n   Therefore the rope had to be worked on during the first two watches (John’s or his wife’s), not later in the night when Bo or Nathan Drew were on duty.\n\n3. How hard was it to undo?\n   Nate says his knots are “very tight – It could take you through the night to untangle what I'd done.”  \n   So whoever did it needed (a) time, (b) light enough to see what he or she was doing, and (c) two good hands.\n\n4. Look for a direct lie.\n   Nate’s plan is to compare what each guard *claims* to what could really have happened.  \n   Among the four statements only one contains a fact that is simply impossible:\n\n      John’s wife says, “I could see the **new moon** climb. It was just past supper-time.”\n\n      • Astronomically a *new* moon cannot be seen at all – its dark side faces Earth and it rises and sets with the sun.  \n      • Even worse, on the night of 3 July 1776 the moon was *not* new; it was a bright waxing gibbous (nearly full).  \n      • Therefore her observation is impossible: she is lying.\n\n5. Did she have opportunity?\n   She was on duty exactly during the hour when the knot must have been worked on (between John’s watch and Bo’s).  \n   She had enough light (twilight) and plenty of time to worry at the rope while the others were busy at other positions.  \n   Unlike Bo (whose left hand is crippled) she had two good hands.\n\n6. Motive?\n   The narrative tells us that some settlers were secretly “Tories.”  \n   John’s wife is the only person who volunteered to take a shift she did not have to take – the perfect way for a spy to get to the gate without drawing suspicion.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohn (frontiersman), John’s wife, Bo (teenage farmer), Nathan Drew\n</SUPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJohn’s wife (no personal name is given in the story)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate in the afternoon Nate secured the fort’s rear gate with a set of extremely tight knots.  \nJohn stood watch until dusk; then his wife offered to relieve him for an hour while he ate.  \nDuring this hour she patiently picked at Nate’s knots – the only time there was still enough twilight to see the rope clearly – and finally worked the gate free.  \nA little later Nate happened to inspect the wall, found the rope hanging loose and retied it at once.  \nRealising the danger, he questioned every guard who had been posted there.  \nBy quoting an impossible astronomical event (“I saw the new moon climb”), John’s wife betrayed her lie and revealed herself as the Tory spy who had tried to open the fort to the attackers.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• John: He was on duty earlier, before the rope was loosened, and left before sunset; his testimony that the knots were still there is corroborated by his (albeit traitorous) wife.  \n• Bo: When the knot was actually untied it was still twilight; by the time Bo came on at about 8-9 p.m. it was already dark, and—according to Nate—it would have taken hours more work to undo the rope. Bo also has only one good hand, making the task virtually impossible for him.  \n• Nathan Drew: He did not come on duty until the small hours and freely admits he never checked the knot; by then Nate had already retied it. He simply had no opportunity to loosen it the first time.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Quickly Nate retied its knot.\nStill outside, more guns were shot. He'd investigate this breach,\nseeking what its clues would teach. \"I tied rope there,\" he'd decide.\n\"Someone left this gate untied. If attackers found that gate\nOur defense would be too late. Round the men up -- there were four\nwho'd stood guard beside this door.\" One of them had told a lie.\nInside was a Tory spy! \"Is it you?\" Nate asked the first.\n\"Leaving us to face the worst?\" It's a frontiersman named John,\nwho'd watched till daylight was gone After Nate's first knots were tied\nlate that afternoon inside. John came forward, thin but proud,\nspeaking in a voice quite loud, Answering, his voice excited, \n\"I know we will stand united.\" John said he'd seen knots that day,\nand they hadn't gone away. \"Though my wife -- as it grew late -- \nstood my last hour at the gate.\" John's wife nodded. \"This is true.\nI saw several knots there too.\" \"It was just an hour, though.\nAfter that, I'd had to go. I could see the new moon climb.\nIt was just past supper time.\" Nate confronted suspect three,\na young man from Tennessee. It's a teenager named Bo.\n\"That's untied? I didn't know. As I started, it grew late. \nSoon I couldn't see that gate! I'd assumed the gates were closed.\"\nNate searched in the eyes of Bo's. \"Was it always in your sight?\nDid you watch it through the night?\" \"No,\" said Bo. \"No, just, till two.\nThat was all that I could do.\" \"Please,\" said Bo, \"I'm just a peasant\nSleepiness was so unpleasant. Usually I work by daylight\non my farm, and sleep by midnight! I've worked hard to till the land.\nSee these fingers on my hand?\" Bo's left hand was badly crippled.\nThrough its skin, sore bumps were rippled. Though he'd work his farm till night\nhe'd hoe dirt with just his right. The fourth guard was Nathan Drew.\nTo this village he was new. But he'd sought the company\nof those men who would be free. Men who glowed with freedom's light,\nstanding by them in their fight. He'd been the relief for John,\nand had guarded them through dawn. All the night, as hours passed\nand they heard each Tory blast, He'd stood sentry by the wall,\ntrusted to protect them all. \"For us all, I'd risk my neck.\nUntied knots? I didn't check.\" But now Nate surveyed the four,\nchecking what he'd thought before. \"England will no longer rule us.\nBut one liar tried to fool us.\" Summoning a final clue,\nhe revealed what he knew. \"My knots are tied very tight.\nIt could take you through the night To untangle what I'd done\nWhile you hid from everyone. Now I can unmask the spy \nwho stood here and told a lie!\" Where the Tories' fight was blocked\nwho had left their gate unlocked? Which suspect had told a lie?\nWhich suspect's a British spy?",
      "answer_options": "(a) Bo; (b) John; (c) John's wife; (d) Nathan Drew",
      "answer": "(d) Nathan Drew",
      "outcome": "\"British loyalties remained\nin one suspect,\" Nate explained.\n\"And, good Bo, it isn't you.\nIt's not something you could do.\nThough you're useful working lands,\nloosing knots would take two hands!\nAnd John didn't wish us ill.\nHis wife proved he's loyal still.\nWhile she heard the rifle shots,\nJohn's wife checked the gates for knots!\nAnd she's innocent -- it's true.\"\nNate revealed what he knew.\n\"Untying would take more power\nthan she had in just one hour.\"\nNate then looked around with pride\nat his countrymen inside.\nWho betrayed them? Nate now knew\nThat their spy was Nathan Drew.\nWhile the evening fight was fought\nNate was tying one more knot.\nFor their safety, now he'd tie\nbinding up their British spy.\nthinking how his skill with ropes\nkept alive their new-found hopes\nThat these 13 colonies\ncould retain their liberties.\nThough that first fight, by a river\nmade South Carolina quiver,\nAnd there followed years of war\nstruggling for rights - and more\nThey'd prevail with a cheer.\nAnd we celebrate each year."
