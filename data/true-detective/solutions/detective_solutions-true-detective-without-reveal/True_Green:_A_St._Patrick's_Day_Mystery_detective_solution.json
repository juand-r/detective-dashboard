    "full_text": "Emerald eyes reluctantly opened at the insistent knocking. Siobhan glanced at her bedside clock, which informed the thirteen year old that it was much earlier than she had intended to rise. With school Monday through Friday, she looked forward to Saturday snoozing. \"Siobhan are you awake?\" Sitting up in the bed, the teen sifted fingers through disorderly auburn locks. “Come in Mama.” Only then did Siobhan notice the delicious aroma from the corned beef and cabbage her mother cooked for their small town's annual True Green Gala, which was in honor of St. Patrick's Day. Each year it was a hit and nearly everyone in town, whether Irish or not, thoroughly enjoyed participating. A potluck type of celebration, it took place at the local park and although St. Patrick's Day wasn't until Monday, the town preferred having the party during the weekend. The bedroom door opened, revealing a statuesque redhead wearing a lightly stained apron with a beaming leprechaun on it. “Sweetie, I need you to run an errand. Could you go to the store for a half-gallon of buttermilk? I forgot to buy it yesterday.” Siobhan nodded, pushing the covers back. “Sure Mama.” * “I'll have breakfast ready when you get back,” Mrs. Doyle called out from the kitchen when she heard her daughter running down the stairs, which was her usual method of getting to the main floor. She wouldn't be surprised if the girl joined the track team upon entering high school. “Okay Mama!” Front door shut and locked, Siobhan grabbed her bicycle and headed down the porch steps. Helmet securely attached she raced off down the quiet street. Minutes later she arrived at the best grocery store in town. Granted there weren't many grocery stores in the small community, but most deemed that Peter MacDonald's business was first rate. He always had the freshest fruits and vegetables, kept his shelves stocked and his prices reasonable. His customers adored Peter MacDonald, a kind and helpful man. Just last week Ella Walsh, one of the oldest residents in Addison, was having a terrible time with her arthritis. Peter delivered her groceries, put them away where she directed and even made her dinner. “Hiya, Mr. MacDonald!” Siobhan said in greeting as she pushed through the glass door, the bell overhead tinkling in response. The grocer looked up from unloading canned goods from a cardboard box. “Morning Siobhan.” After a glance at his watch he added, “You're up early! Helping your Mama make her yummy corned beef and cabbage?” She nodded. “I was sent for buttermilk for the bread.” Peter began to speak in a conspiratorial whisper, although the store was empty except for them. “Don't tell my wife, but your mother creates the best Irish soda bread I've ever tasted.” Siobhan grinned as she made her way to the refrigerator section. As she waited for Peter to count out her change, she noted that the man appeared the slightest bit glum. \"Mr. Mac?\" She folded the bills he handed her, tucking them into one of the many pockets sewn onto her verdant overalls. “Yes honey?” “Are you okay?” It was on the tip of his tongue to respond with a hearty “yes,” but she studied him with such earnestness that he couldn't. “Not really. Someone stole the piñata.” He pointed toward the entrance. “From my truck parked right in front of the store.” Siobhan gasped. Just like her mother was known for bringing her famous corned beef and cabbage each year, Peter always supplied a shamrock piñata filled with circa two hundred premium chocolates and candies. “When?” “I opened the store earlier than usual – about 4:30 – and I went out to my truck around six o’clock and noticed that it was missing from the cargo bed. Had it under a tarp.” Sighing, he drummed his fingertips on the counter. “And this year I put something special in it. Besides candy, I inserted fifty one dollar bills stamped with a tiny shamrock.” Siobhan's eyes widened. “We need to find whoever did this!” This was a catastrophe. Whoever was responsible definitely was not exhibiting true green spirit! Detective persona slipping into place, Siobhan asked for a sheet of paper and a pen. “Siobhan you go home. Don't worry about it. There'll be plenty of other fun activities.” “But someone stole from you and I wanna know who that someone is.” The next few minutes were spent with Siobhan questioning Mr. MacDonald. By the end of her mini-interrogation she didn't have much to go on, but it would have to do. Buttermilk in the basket attached to her bicycle, Siobhan straddled the seat while she reread her notes: “Piñata taken between 4:30 - 6:00 a.m. Each one-dollar bill had tiny shamrock stamped in upper right-hand corner. Doing stamping, Zach - Mr. Mac's son – is only person besides Mrs. Mac who should know about $50 in piñata.” Siobhan's next destination, after dropping the buttermilk off at home, was the MacDonald household to have a chat with fifteen-year-old Zach, who was her friend. He wasn't supposed to tell others about the money stuffed into the piñata, but did he? And if he kept his mouth shut did he steal from his own father? * Although she pleaded her case, Siobhan wasn't allowed to leave until she ate her breakfast. Scarfing it down in record time, she ran upstairs to grab what she referred to as her CSI (crime scene investigation) backpack. Notepads, magnifying glasses and a handheld recorder were among the items inside. On a daily basis Siobhan dreamt of when she would become a true detective. Promising that she would return by eleven, Siobhan rode to Zach's house around the corner. According to Zach, he only went for a walk during which he met up with his friend Evan, who was out walking his two golden retrievers. Zach admitted that he told Evan and another pal named Richie about the piñata money. The plot thickens, Siobhan thought as she scribbled this down. “Hey, you wouldn’t happen to have ten bucks on ya?” Zach asked. He looked embarrassed. “My dad withheld my allowance because I missed a homework assignment, and I want to go to a movie.” “Sorry, no cash on me.” She thanked Zach for his time and left for the Carpenter home. Emily, Evan's younger sister, whom she had three classes with, answered the door. Her cheeks were bulging and she was holding a jar in her left hand. Emily hurriedly swallowed. “Siobhan! What brings you here? I'm headed to the laundromat to wash some tablecloths for the party. You wanna go? You can pull my Radio Flyer.” Emily’s breath smelled like chocolate and Siobhan noticed the jar was full of quarters. “I would, but I actually need to speak with your brother.” Emily turned, looking toward the stairs. “EVAN! DOOR!” She grinned at her schoolmate. “He'll be here in a minute.” “Thanks. Hey, you have something…” Siobhan tapped the corner of her mouth. “Oops. Dampening a finger, Emily wiped off the smudge. “It was chocolate. Candy.\" “Candy?!” “Yeah. From Valentine’s.” “A month ago?” “I received a lot of boxes. My last one, finally.” Emily put the jar in her red wagon, next to her mother's festive tablecloths and a box of detergent. She grasped the handle and rolled it passed the visitor. “See you at True Green?” “You bet.” Evan arrived at the door, appearing nothing short of quizzical. “Siobhan? What's up?” She explained that she was investigating the piñata theft and asked what he had been up to that morning. “I was doing what I do every morning,” he said, slightly miffed, “taking our dogs Duke and Duchess for a walk.” Next Siobhan paid the Harris house a visit. Richie's father informed Siobhan that his son was busy spending his allowance at the arcade. She discovered him next to a pinball machine counting his money. “Hi Richie.” She told him about the missing piñata, gauging his reaction to the news. He seemed appropriately stunned, but so had his friends. “Could I see your ones?” “You think I swiped it?” He didn't wait for a response. “Here,” he said, handing her the bills. There were four ones – none of them stamped. “Am I innocent? ‘Cause I gotta go.\" Richie smiled despite being a suspect. Siobhan's eyes landed on the change machine. “I'll be in touch.” Clapping him on the shoulder she walked away, the “light bulb” in her head aglow. Sam the arcade owner was convinced to unlock the change machine, and after a thorough search the gloved Detective Doyle found five shamrock-stamped bills, which she handled with a pair of tweezers. She looked up, noting the surveillance camera trained on the change machine. “Your camera working, Sam?” It was, and Sam let her view the footage from earlier that day. It confirmed what Siobhan already knew.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Who knew there was money inside the piñata?\n    –  Only three people at first: Mr. & Mrs. MacDonald and their son Zach.  \n       Zach admits he told two friends, Evan and Richie.  \n       Therefore the circle of people with a motive (easy cash) is now five:  \n       Zach, Mrs. MacDonald, Evan, Richie, and (possibly through Evan) Emily.\n\n2.  Who needed or wanted money?\n    –  Mrs. MacDonald: no sign of need, and she was home asleep.  \n    –  Zach: allowance withheld, asks Siobhan for $10 → shows he still has no cash.  \n    –  Evan: no mention of money problems.  \n    –  Emily: taking a wagon-load of table-cloths to a coin-laundry and is already\n       carrying a large jar full of quarters – she obviously does not need more.  \n    –  Richie: at the arcade “spending his allowance,” but arcade games run on\n       quarters.  He is standing beside a change machine converting bills to coins.\n\n3.  Physical evidence\n    –  Every stolen dollar is stamped with a tiny shamrock.  \n    –  Richie shows Siobhan the paper money he is still carrying: four $1 bills,\n       none of them stamped.  \n    –  Five shamrock-stamped $1 bills are found INSIDE the arcade change machine.  \n    –  The surveillance camera aimed at that machine shows exactly who fed those\n       bills into it.\n\n4.  Logical deduction\n    a)  Whoever stole the piñata would quickly realise the marked bills could be\n        recognised.  The safest way to spend them anonymously in a small town is\n        to exchange them for coins in a machine that does not look at stamps.\n    b)  Only one suspect is observed needing large quantities of quarters and\n        standing at the very machine where the stamped bills turn up – Richie.\n    c)  Zach cannot be the one: if he possessed fifty marked dollars he would not\n        be begging Siobhan for ten bucks.  \n    d)  Emily has quarters already; she never needed to use the arcade machine\n        that morning, and the camera will not show her.\n    e)  Evan was walking his dogs at the time of the theft; the camera does not\n        implicate him.\n\n5.  The video footage “confirmed what Siobhan already knew.”  \n    What did she “already know” once she saw the stamped bills in the machine?\n    –  That only Richie, who had just been standing there, could have put them in.\n    The recording therefore shows Richie feeding the shamrock bills into the\n    changer, clinching the case.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nZach MacDonald, Evan Carpenter, Emily Carpenter, Richie Harris, Mrs. MacDonald\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nRichie Harris\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter hearing from his friend Zach that the piñata would contain fifty marked\none-dollar bills as a secret bonus, fifteen-year-old Richie Harris decides to\nget the money for himself.  Very early Saturday morning (between 4:30 and\n6:00 a.m.) he sneaks out of his house, rides his bike to Peter MacDonald’s\nstore, lifts the tarp from the pick-up bed and steals the shamrock piñata.\nSomewhere nearby he breaks it open, stuffs the marked bills into his pockets\nand keeps a pouch of chocolates for later, then dumps the empty cardboard\nshell in a trash bin.\n\nLater that morning he goes to the arcade.  Not wanting to be seen spending\nrecognisable stamped bills, he feeds several of them into the unmanned change\nmachine, receiving quarters for pinball and video games.  Five of those marked\nbills remain inside the change mechanism.\n\nSiobhan, noticing that Richie has no stamped bills in his wallet and suddenly\n“lights up” when she looks at the change machine, asks the owner to open it.\nFinding the stamped currency, she checks the surveillance tape, which shows\nRichie converting the money.  The evidence is conclusive: Richie is the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Zach MacDonald – Although he knew about the money and needed cash, he is\n   still broke enough to beg Siobhan for ten dollars; the video does not show\n   him using the change machine.\n\n•  Evan Carpenter – His regular dawn routine of walking Duke and Duchess gives\n   him a credible, checkable alibi; the camera footage at the arcade never shows\n   him exchanging money.\n\n•  Emily Carpenter – Has plenty of quarters already and no need to convert\n   marked bills.  She never appears on the surveillance recording.\n\n•  Mrs. MacDonald – Busy preparing food at home; no motive and no opportunity.\n\nTherefore only Richie Harris had the motive, the opportunity, was in possession\nof the stolen marked money, and is caught on camera using it.  He acted alone.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Siobhan's eyes landed on the change machine. “I'll be in touch.” Clapping him on the shoulder she walked away, the “light bulb” in her head aglow. Sam the arcade owner was convinced to unlock the change machine, and after a thorough search the gloved Detective Doyle found five shamrock-stamped bills, which she handled with a pair of tweezers. She looked up, noting the surveillance camera trained on the change machine. “Your camera working, Sam?” It was, and Sam let her view the footage from earlier that day. It confirmed what Siobhan already knew.",

      "mystery_text": "Emerald eyes reluctantly opened at the insistent knocking. Siobhan glanced at her bedside clock, which informed the thirteen year old that it was much earlier than she had intended to rise. With school Monday through Friday, she looked forward to Saturday snoozing. \"Siobhan are you awake?\" Sitting up in the bed, the teen sifted fingers through disorderly auburn locks. “Come in Mama.” Only then did Siobhan notice the delicious aroma from the corned beef and cabbage her mother cooked for their small town's annual True Green Gala, which was in honor of St. Patrick's Day. Each year it was a hit and nearly everyone in town, whether Irish or not, thoroughly enjoyed participating. A potluck type of celebration, it took place at the local park and although St. Patrick's Day wasn't until Monday, the town preferred having the party during the weekend. The bedroom door opened, revealing a statuesque redhead wearing a lightly stained apron with a beaming leprechaun on it. “Sweetie, I need you to run an errand. Could you go to the store for a half-gallon of buttermilk? I forgot to buy it yesterday.” Siobhan nodded, pushing the covers back. “Sure Mama.” * “I'll have breakfast ready when you get back,” Mrs. Doyle called out from the kitchen when she heard her daughter running down the stairs, which was her usual method of getting to the main floor. She wouldn't be surprised if the girl joined the track team upon entering high school. “Okay Mama!” Front door shut and locked, Siobhan grabbed her bicycle and headed down the porch steps. Helmet securely attached she raced off down the quiet street. Minutes later she arrived at the best grocery store in town. Granted there weren't many grocery stores in the small community, but most deemed that Peter MacDonald's business was first rate. He always had the freshest fruits and vegetables, kept his shelves stocked and his prices reasonable. His customers adored Peter MacDonald, a kind and helpful man. Just last week Ella Walsh, one of the oldest residents in Addison, was having a terrible time with her arthritis. Peter delivered her groceries, put them away where she directed and even made her dinner. “Hiya, Mr. MacDonald!” Siobhan said in greeting as she pushed through the glass door, the bell overhead tinkling in response. The grocer looked up from unloading canned goods from a cardboard box. “Morning Siobhan.” After a glance at his watch he added, “You're up early! Helping your Mama make her yummy corned beef and cabbage?” She nodded. “I was sent for buttermilk for the bread.” Peter began to speak in a conspiratorial whisper, although the store was empty except for them. “Don't tell my wife, but your mother creates the best Irish soda bread I've ever tasted.” Siobhan grinned as she made her way to the refrigerator section. As she waited for Peter to count out her change, she noted that the man appeared the slightest bit glum. \"Mr. Mac?\" She folded the bills he handed her, tucking them into one of the many pockets sewn onto her verdant overalls. “Yes honey?” “Are you okay?” It was on the tip of his tongue to respond with a hearty “yes,” but she studied him with such earnestness that he couldn't. “Not really. Someone stole the piñata.” He pointed toward the entrance. “From my truck parked right in front of the store.” Siobhan gasped. Just like her mother was known for bringing her famous corned beef and cabbage each year, Peter always supplied a shamrock piñata filled with circa two hundred premium chocolates and candies. “When?” “I opened the store earlier than usual – about 4:30 – and I went out to my truck around six o’clock and noticed that it was missing from the cargo bed. Had it under a tarp.” Sighing, he drummed his fingertips on the counter. “And this year I put something special in it. Besides candy, I inserted fifty one dollar bills stamped with a tiny shamrock.” Siobhan's eyes widened. “We need to find whoever did this!” This was a catastrophe. Whoever was responsible definitely was not exhibiting true green spirit! Detective persona slipping into place, Siobhan asked for a sheet of paper and a pen. “Siobhan you go home. Don't worry about it. There'll be plenty of other fun activities.” “But someone stole from you and I wanna know who that someone is.” The next few minutes were spent with Siobhan questioning Mr. MacDonald. By the end of her mini-interrogation she didn't have much to go on, but it would have to do. Buttermilk in the basket attached to her bicycle, Siobhan straddled the seat while she reread her notes: “Piñata taken between 4:30 - 6:00 a.m. Each one-dollar bill had tiny shamrock stamped in upper right-hand corner. Doing stamping, Zach - Mr. Mac's son – is only person besides Mrs. Mac who should know about $50 in piñata.” Siobhan's next destination, after dropping the buttermilk off at home, was the MacDonald household to have a chat with fifteen-year-old Zach, who was her friend. He wasn't supposed to tell others about the money stuffed into the piñata, but did he? And if he kept his mouth shut did he steal from his own father? * Although she pleaded her case, Siobhan wasn't allowed to leave until she ate her breakfast. Scarfing it down in record time, she ran upstairs to grab what she referred to as her CSI (crime scene investigation) backpack. Notepads, magnifying glasses and a handheld recorder were among the items inside. On a daily basis Siobhan dreamt of when she would become a true detective. Promising that she would return by eleven, Siobhan rode to Zach's house around the corner. According to Zach, he only went for a walk during which he met up with his friend Evan, who was out walking his two golden retrievers. Zach admitted that he told Evan and another pal named Richie about the piñata money. The plot thickens, Siobhan thought as she scribbled this down. “Hey, you wouldn’t happen to have ten bucks on ya?” Zach asked. He looked embarrassed. “My dad withheld my allowance because I missed a homework assignment, and I want to go to a movie.” “Sorry, no cash on me.” She thanked Zach for his time and left for the Carpenter home. Emily, Evan's younger sister, whom she had three classes with, answered the door. Her cheeks were bulging and she was holding a jar in her left hand. Emily hurriedly swallowed. “Siobhan! What brings you here? I'm headed to the laundromat to wash some tablecloths for the party. You wanna go? You can pull my Radio Flyer.” Emily’s breath smelled like chocolate and Siobhan noticed the jar was full of quarters. “I would, but I actually need to speak with your brother.” Emily turned, looking toward the stairs. “EVAN! DOOR!” She grinned at her schoolmate. “He'll be here in a minute.” “Thanks. Hey, you have something…” Siobhan tapped the corner of her mouth. “Oops. Dampening a finger, Emily wiped off the smudge. “It was chocolate. Candy.\" “Candy?!” “Yeah. From Valentine’s.” “A month ago?” “I received a lot of boxes. My last one, finally.” Emily put the jar in her red wagon, next to her mother's festive tablecloths and a box of detergent. She grasped the handle and rolled it passed the visitor. “See you at True Green?” “You bet.” Evan arrived at the door, appearing nothing short of quizzical. “Siobhan? What's up?” She explained that she was investigating the piñata theft and asked what he had been up to that morning. “I was doing what I do every morning,” he said, slightly miffed, “taking our dogs Duke and Duchess for a walk.” Next Siobhan paid the Harris house a visit. Richie's father informed Siobhan that his son was busy spending his allowance at the arcade. She discovered him next to a pinball machine counting his money. “Hi Richie.” She told him about the missing piñata, gauging his reaction to the news. He seemed appropriately stunned, but so had his friends. “Could I see your ones?” “You think I swiped it?” He didn't wait for a response. “Here,” he said, handing her the bills. There were four ones – none of them stamped. “Am I innocent? ‘Cause I gotta go.\" Richie smiled despite being a suspect. Siobhan's eyes landed on the change machine. “I'll be in touch.” Clapping him on the shoulder she walked away, the “light bulb” in her head aglow. Sam the arcade owner was convinced to unlock the change machine, and after a thorough search the gloved Detective Doyle found five shamrock-stamped bills, which she handled with a pair of tweezers.
