On one day it's customary\n-- third Monday in February -- to remember all the greats\nleading the United States. For their presidential glory,\nwe present a rhyming story. But six lines will hide a clue.\nThere's a mystery here too! In some states, the schools are closed.\n(Special rules are now imposed.) But a boy named Bill forgot.\nThinking he would still be taught, he ran proudly to his school\nat 8:10 (which was the rule), Carrying quite recklessly\nSchool books teaching history. Yet the day had left its mark.\nAt the school, the rooms were dark. Through the window, Bill peeked, wary \nat the unlit school library. In the grey dawn's light he spied \non the building's dark inside. Bill saw paintings hanging solemn\nby the doorway's entrance column. They faced paintings on the wall.\nWashington was standing tall. Paintings there would represent\nEvery U.S. president. There were 44 in all,\nhanging from his dark school wall. George Bush senior, and his son\nstared back at George Washington. Lincoln frowned, and Reagan, too.\nAnd Obama. (He is new!) Cleveland, Clinton, Kennedy\nand Jackson (from Tennessee). Nixon, Johnson, Harrison\nall looked to George Washington. Suddenly, the room awoke\nand the presidents all spoke! \"Wake up, George,\" one painting said.\n\"It's the holiday you dread!\" They were teasing, and George smiled\nat the way that he'd been riled. \"Polk,\" he said, \"you've got it wrong.\"\nPolk replied \"It's been too long. Our spirits must wait a year\nFor this day to re-appear.\" Polk leaned grandly on a shelf.\nLincoln chuckled to himself. \"My dad and I both were chosen,\"\nsaid George Bush, his face unfrozen. \"So was mine! We both were winning!\"\nyelled John Quincy Adams, grinning. Two cousins were President.\nRoosevelts -- so confident. They gave Harrison some tweaks.\nHis term lasted just four weeks! Nixon said that pain he knew.\nHe'd left his term early too! Lincoln nodded, without speaking.\nWilson's painting started creaking. To the window he was pointing\nat something quite disappointing. \"In the White House, we worked lonely\nwith our best advisors only. But a young face pays a visit\nby the window. There -- what is it? Where the holiday light shone.\nSee that boy? We're not alone!\" Bill, embarrassed, turned to go.\nWhy he stayed he didn't know. But it was a chance to see\nfamous men from history. And to know and hear today\nwhat the presidents would say. Filled with awe and fascination,\nhe entered the conversation. \"Hello, Mr. Presidents.\n Hope you like your residence.\" \"It's quite grand,\" said Jefferson.\n\"My painting gets lots of sun!\" Monroe added, speaking slow, \n\"We can watch the children grow. Smiling while we watch them learn,\nhoping that good grades they'll earn.\" \"If you're smart,\" Abe Lincoln said,\n\"You could hang up here instead. We were all boys once, like you.\nYou could be President too!\" \"Or your wife,\" said Clinton, straight.\n\"My wife tried back in '08.\" \"It's a privilege that's earned,\nBased partly on what you've learned. I was poor,\" Abe Lincoln said.\n\"But I studied hard -- I read. Soon my speeches moved the nation,\nAnd I won inauguration.\" Andrew Johnson followed him.\n\"It was hard,\" said Johnson, grim. \"After Lincoln, I could see\nthat the states did not agree. And the Congress overreached.\nPretty soon, I got impeached!\" Wilson knew the weight they bore. \n\"When I served, we were at war.\" Truman knew that struggle too. \nHe'd started in World War II. He'd hoped his war would be last.\nBut another followed fast. Johnson, Nixon, Kennedy\nall knew war, they could agree. But Nixon knew triumphs soon.\n\"I sent men up to the moon! But to be the one selected\nis the best -- to be elected. I lost once, but then I won.\nMy slogan? 'Nixon's the one!'\" Truman laughed at what he'd said.\n\"Papers said I'd lost instead. A mistake -- it's only human.\nThey'd wrote 'Dewey defeats Truman!'\" Ford said, \"Yes, my greatest news\nwas to be the one they'd choose.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. I listed every statement each “talking” portrait makes and checked it against recorded U.S. history.\n\n2. Every remark is true except one:\n • Gerald R. Ford says,  \n  “Yes, my greatest news was to be the one they’d choose.  \n  When the ballots all were sent, I’d been elected president.”\n\n   Fact: Ford was never elected either Vice-President or President; he was appointed V.P. (25th Amendment) and became President when Nixon resigned, then lost the 1976 election.  \n   So Ford’s boast about winning a presidential ballot is false.\n\n3. Because Bill says the false speaker is “the replica,” the portrait that uttered the inaccuracy must be the forgery. All other portraits spoke accurately, so those canvases are genuine.\n\n4. Bill also notes, “The original’s been taken. It hangs by my teacher’s chair!”  \n That tells us who physically removed the authentic portrait and substituted the fake: the teacher wanted Ford’s portrait for a classroom display and quietly swapped it, leaving the copied canvas in the library.\n\n5. Motive: give the class a Presidents’ Day decoration without anyone noticing the missing painting.  \n   Opportunity: teachers had after-hours access to the school.  \n   Physical evidence: the genuine Ford portrait is sitting beside the teacher’s desk.\n\n6. Therefore the forged, lying “Ford” canvas is the culprit object, and the human culprit is the teacher who installed it. No other president portrait spoke an inaccuracy, so none of the others is implicated.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nForged Gerald R. Ford portrait, Bill’s teacher, the other presidential portraits\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nForged portrait of President Gerald R. Ford\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nBill’s teacher (name not given)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nA day or two before Presidents’ Day the teacher wanted to decorate the classroom with an original presidential painting. After school the teacher took the genuine Gerald R. Ford canvas from the library and hung it beside the classroom chair. To avoid immediate discovery, the teacher replaced it with a quickly painted copy. The hurried forger/teacher did not check Ford’s résumé and mistakenly had the portrait claim he had been elected President. On the holiday morning Bill peered into the dark library, heard the portraits talking, and spotted the historical error. Realising that a counterfeit must be speaking, he identified the Ford painting as the fake and revealed that the authentic canvas was now beside his teacher’s desk.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAll other portraits—Washington, the Adamses, the Bushes, Lincoln, both Roosevelts, Polk, Truman, Nixon, Jefferson, Monroe, the Harrisons, and so on—made statements that are historically correct. None of them supplied false information, so they cannot be the forged picture Bill detected. They are therefore genuine and innocent. The teacher, while responsible for the theft, is only an accomplice; the immediate “culprit” inside the story’s logic is the sham Ford portrait whose false claim gave the game away.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He's a forgery and hid it.\"\n\"Do you think Bill Clinton did it?\" Adams, in his fancy suit, \nseemed ready to prosecute. \"Or is Woodrow Wilson lying?\n Which fake president is spying? Finding fakes could be quite fun.\nMaybe Nixon IS the one.\" In this presidential garden,\nNixon said \"I beg your pardon?\" Then he gave a dirty look.\n\"Don't blame me! I'm not a crook! Can we find the guilty man?\"\nObama said, \"Yes we can.\" Through the window, Bill would stare\nat the talking paintings there. \"Do not let your faith be shaken.\nThe original's been taken. It's been hid, and I know where.\nIt hangs by my teacher's chair! but replaced here by a new one.\n(I could tell you weren't the true one.) Everything he'd said was wrong.\nLies come out before too long. I respect the rest of you --\neverything you said was true!\" Since he knew his history,\nBill could solve their mystery. And he earned respect immense\nfrom the room of Presidents. Now's your chance to do the same. \nPlay this President's Day game. Though they all looked grand and wise\nwhich painting was telling lies?",
      "answer_options": "(a) George Bush; (b) Gerald Ford; (c) John Quincy Adams; (d) Richard Nixon",
      "answer": "(b) Gerald Ford",
      "outcome": "\"Bush spoke true -- no lie he fed us.\nBoth his dad and he have led us.\nAdams said the same thing, too.\nAnd for him, it's also true.\nNixon lost, and then he won,\nwith the chant 'Nixon's the one.'\nAnd he sent men to the moon,\nonly to face crisis soon.\nNixon said that pain he knew --\nHe'd left his term early too.\nNixon's painting tells the truth!\"\nsaid the history-loving youth.\n\"There was turmoil in store\nin 1974.\nNixon resigned early then,\nbut we wouldn't vote again.\nHis Vice President instead\nserved as President and led.\nBut his next term we rejected.\nIt was Carter we elected.\nThis forged painting tried to claim\nthat he'd won that voting game.\n(\"When the ballots all were sent,\nI'd been elected president.\")\nFord's true painting would've said\nJimmy Carter pulled ahead.\nThough the presidency's fun\nIt's one thing Ford never won!\"\nAs the sun rose in the sky,\nBill then said a fond good-bye\nto the talking paintings there.\n\"Goodbye Presidents. Take care!\"\nAnd the men who'd led the nation\nnow knew the next generation\ncould solve any mystery\nand had learned their history."
