    "full_text": "It was Christmas, 1852, in London, a jolly time for those who could enjoy the holiday, and a plain working time for those who could not. The third type of person, the professional crook, who lived on the fringes of society, sometimes cheered the season. After all, it made rich and profitable pickings for the pickpockets who filled London’s badly lit streets. There was no one that trained pickpockets more skillfully than Fagin, who kept a training school for that illegal profession, in his dank loft on the edges of a forgettable address, not far from the black and smelly Thames River. The boys, and a young girl or two as well, were trained in the fine art of picking the pocket or snatching the purse of wealthy shoppers. The trick was to do it so naturally that a slight bump was not even noticed by the victim of the crime. Sometimes the young thief would distract the victim’s attention by calling across the street to someone else, or by yelling, “Fire!” But often the touch was so light, and the use of a small sharp knife so clever, that a purse could be cut from the strings that held it to the victim’s belt or skirt in the twinkling of an eye. Or, the victim was so distracted that, as he looked in one direction, the pickpocket’s fingers extracted the fat wallet from his inner jacket pocket. By the time the victim was aware of the loss, the pickpocket was halfway back to Fagin’s loft, sure of praise and a good, warm dinner. The Artful Dodger was the cleverest young thief, and Oliver Twist, escaped from the workhouse, was the latest recruit and student. Back and forth, he went in the loft, practicing his pickpocket technique under The Artful Dodger’s critical eye, following Fagin, who pretended to be a rich victim. The practicing went on for weeks. Finally, in exasperation, Fagin sneered at Oliver and said “Won’t you ever be ready? I keep waiting for you to steal my wallet, and you haven’t done a thing. It looks like no dinner for you, young Oliver! Then Oliver Twist held up his prize, Fagin’s wallet, which Oliver had cleverly extracted from his inside jacket pocket, so lightly that Fagin had not even felt its loss. “Well done, Master Oliver,” said Fagin, delightedly. “I didn’t feel a thing. You have served a fine apprenticeship and earned your dinner. Tomorrow morning, it’s your turn to put what you have learned into practice on the streets of London! You’ll go out with The Artful Dodger and with Nancy, shortly after breakfast.” Oliver smiled. Nancy was a young woman who often joined the pickpocket group as they wandered the streets of London, in search of victims. Oliver was pleased that no mention was made of Nancy’s companion, Bill Sykes, a violent man, “who, you mark my words, will come to no good end,” as Fagin often said, when Bill Sykes was not within hearing. Nancy often diverted the attention of their victims with her winsome smile, and then she vanished before the thefts were noticed. It was much better than yelling “Fire!” in a crowd and far more discreet. The next morning, right outside Simpson’s, where the wealthy would often come for a rich steak and kidney pie for luncheon, the four took up their positions in the crowd. The Artful Dodger walked slowly along the sidewalk, with Oliver two or three steps behind. Fagin approached from the opposite direction, while Nancy crossed the street at the corner, then came straight towards The Artful Dodger and Oliver. Fagin was three or four steps behind her. If everything worked well, either The Artful Dodger or Oliver would steal the passerby’s wallet or purse, depending upon which boy was closer. No clumsy moves were allowed. If neither boy was close enough to the approaching victim, they would simply wait a few minutes, go around the block, and try the entire sequence again. If Nancy was close enough, she might call to one of the boys, attracting the victim’s attention. Or The Artful Dodger might rudely point and say “What a pretty face,” hoping the victim would turn his head towards Nancy. Either way, once the wallet or purse had been taken, the thief would pass it to Nancy coming in the opposite direction. Half a block later, she would pass it to Fagin. The victim, if he or she caught on that there had been a theft, could only point out Oliver or The Artful Dodger to the police, and neither one would have the stolen property at that point. Without evidence, the chances were good that the matter would drop there. The little group of pickpockets also made sure that they would not return to the same street for several weeks. After all, there were enough rich shopping districts in London’s West End, all of which Fagin knew well, to last throughout the holiday season. Christmas Eve was a special challenge, but Fagin insisted that they go out and try their thieving luck, despite the fact that he had a raging, constant cough. The Artful Dodger was in good form and looked forward to the fine Christmas dinner that Fagin had promised as their reward after the night’s outing. Nancy wasn’t sure that she could go, because Bill Sykes was in one of his bad moods. However, Oliver looked forward to practicing his pickpocket skills, and so they set forth. The rich gentleman, their intended victim, stood outside Rule’s Restaurant looking at his gold watch, which was suspended from a thick gold chain to his vest pocket. He opened the back lid of the watch, sighed as he looked at the portrait of his missing grandson, then closed the watch and returned it to his vest pocket. The Artful Dodger and Oliver Twist approached him along the sidewalk, while Nancy and Fagin slowly made their way towards the scene from their starting points down the street. As The Artful Dodger and Oliver approached, the man unexpectedly looked up. His glance seemed to freeze The Artful Dodger, who cried “Nancy!” as she came closer. The Artful Dodger planned to grab the victim’s watch as soon as he turned - but the rich gentleman did not turn, and he stepped away from The Artful Dodger instead. Then he quickly glanced at Oliver, and his expression was one of total surprise. Could this be his lost grandson after all these years? Even in these patched clothes, the boy’s resemblance to his daughter was startling. The man gave a cry of surprise and pointed towards Oliver, then grabbed him by the wrists with his strong arms. Fagin, three feet behind Nancy, who was approaching the scene rapidly, now turned around, coughed nervously and fled the scene. Nancy, who had more poise, continued slowly towards Oliver, the gentleman and The Artful Dodger, and without making contact with either boy, proceeded down the street. A London policeman, posted just outside the restaurant, watched the scene with keen interest and came quickly. The bobby asked, “What happened, sir?” “It is a case of robbery, I think. Better take this young man into custody, until we sort out what has happened.” The policeman nodded, as he watched The Artful Dodger, Nancy and Fagin disappear into the crowd. “I’ve had my eye on that bunch,” he said. At Police Headquarters, Sergeant Cuff was amused. He had been following the gang, with Fagin, Nancy, The Artful Dodger and Oliver, for several weeks, as they shifted their location around the West End. “Patrolman Cavendish tells me that three members of the gang, the Fagin gang if I am correct, have disappeared. You have the fourth gang member here.” “Yes, but I believe that he is a victim himself, Sergeant Cuff. I don’t think that I was the victim of a crime, all things considered.” “We’ll see about that, sir. What property did you say is missing?” “Actually, I’ll let you figure out who has my wallet now, Sergeant. The missing property that is most valuable has now been found. I refer to my grandson, young Oliver here. And if you can tell me who has my watch, I will make sure that you have the finest Christmas dinner you’ve ever enjoyed!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWHO HAD A REASON TO STEAL?\n •\tFagin, Nancy and the Artful Dodger live by theft; motive is obvious.  \n •\tOliver is only a trainee and, at the critical moment, becomes the object of the old gentleman’s attention.  \n •\tBill Sykes is not on the scene.  \n •\tThe policeman and the gentleman plainly have no motive.\n\n2.\tWHO COULD ACTUALLY REACH THE WATCH?\n •\tThe Artful Dodger meant to take the watch “as soon as the gentleman turned,” but the gentleman never turned. The text states he therefore did not carry out the snatch.  \n •\tOliver’s wrists are seized immediately; his hands are immobilised.  \n •\tFagin is still three feet behind Nancy when the seizure occurs, and at once turns round and runs – he never gets close enough.  \n •\tNancy, however, keeps walking straight toward the little group, passes directly in front of (and within arm’s-length of) the old gentleman while he is gripping Oliver, then “without making contact with either boy, proceeded down the street.”  \n  •\tThis wording – “without making contact with either boy” – is a clue: the author is careful not to tell us she avoided contact with the gentleman.  \n  •\tThe gentleman’s attention and both his hands are occupied; his watch is hanging from a chain on his waistcoat. A practised thief like Nancy could cut the chain or lift the watch in a single brush-past.\n\n3.\tWHO COULD THE PROPERTY BE PASSED TO?\n •\tThe normal routine is Boy → Nancy → Fagin.  \n •\tBut Fagin has already bolted; Nancy therefore has nobody to hand the loot to.  \n •\tThe constable sees all three (Fagin, Nancy, Dodger) “disappear into the crowd,” i.e. none of them is stopped long enough for a hand-off in his presence.\n\n4.\tWHAT DOES THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAY AT THE STATION?\n •\tHe tells Sergeant Cuff, “I’ll let you figure out who has my wallet now… And if you can tell me who has my watch…”.  \n •\tHe does not say “which of the boys,” but “who.” He realises a third party (Nancy) brushed him.  \n •\tHe is sure Oliver is innocent because both of Oliver’s hands were in his own grasp when the watch vanished.\n\n5.\tCONCLUSION\n •\tOnly Nancy had the combination of motive, opportunity, and freedom of movement to lift the watch.  \n •\tThe Artful Dodger almost certainly picked the gentleman’s wallet while the wrists were being seized, but the question we are asked to solve is: “Who is the culprit?”—the person now holding the most valuable missing property, the watch.  \n •\tHence, Nancy is the principal culprit; Fagin and the Dodger are accomplices who organised and abetted the attempt.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nNancy, Fagin, Jack “The Artful Dodger” Dawkins, Oliver Twist, Bill Sykes\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nNancy (surname unknown, sometimes called Nancy Sykes)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nFagin; Jack “The Artful Dodger” Dawkins\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•\tFagin stations his team outside Rule’s Restaurant on Christmas Eve.  \n•\tThe old gentleman replaces his gold watch in his waistcoat pocket and is about to walk on.  \n•\tThe Artful Dodger and Oliver close in; Nancy and Fagin approach from the opposite direction.  \n•\tThe victim unexpectedly looks up; the Dodger freezes and calls “Nancy!” to start the distraction.  \n•\tThe gentleman steps away from the Dodger, sees Oliver, and, thinking the boy might be his long-lost grandson, seizes Oliver by both wrists.  \n•\tWhile the gentleman’s eyes and hands are fixed on Oliver, Nancy passes directly in front of him.  \n  – In that split second she slices or unhooks the heavy watch-chain and spirits the watch into her muff/pocket.  \n•\tFagin, seeing the arrest about to happen, panics, turns round and hurries the opposite way.  \n•\tNancy walks calmly on, melting into the crowd; a moment later the Artful Dodger follows; all three disappear before the constable can reach them.  \n•\tAt the station Oliver is brought in, but the gentleman quickly realises he has recovered his grandson and lost only his watch (and perhaps his wallet).  \n•\tNancy, still in possession of the watch, will later re-join Fagin and the Dodger at their hiding place.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nFagin – Planned the crime but never came near enough to take the watch and fled before Nancy committed the theft.  \nJack “The Artful Dodger” Dawkins – Intended thief of the watch but was foiled when the victim did not turn; he never touched it.  \nOliver Twist – Had no chance: both his wrists were held from the instant the gentleman reacted.  \nBill Sykes – Not present at the scene at all.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The rich victim was on a mission to discover his lost grandson, Oliver, whom he recognized as one of the street thieves. His cries scared off both Fagin and Nancy, neither of whom came into any contact with The Artful Dodger or Oliver, so they could not have been passed any stolen property. The Artful Dodger missed his chance to steal the rich gentleman’s property when the intended victim did not turn his head to look at Nancy and stepped away instead.\nOliver had no chance to make the theft, because the intended victim quickly grabbed Oliver’s wrists with his powerful arms.\nThe watch never left the intended victim’s possession. By thinking quickly and alerting the police, he thought the gang members would leave, as they quickly did, and give him the chance to see if young Oliver really was his missing grandson, in the safety of the police station. To his delight, that was the case, and the restored family then celebrated their finest Christmas ever!",

The boys, and a young girl or two as well, were trained in the fine art of picking the pocket or snatching the purse of wealthy shoppers. The trick was to do it so naturally that a slight bump was not even noticed by the victim of the crime. Sometimes the young thief would distract the victim’s attention by calling across the street to someone else, or by yelling, “Fire!” But often the touch was so light, and the use of a small sharp knife so clever, that a purse could be cut from the strings that held it to the victim’s belt or skirt in the twinkling of an eye. Or, the victim was so distracted that, as he looked in one direction, the pickpocket’s fingers extracted the fat wallet from his inner jacket pocket. By the time the victim was aware of the loss, the pickpocket was halfway back to Fagin’s loft, sure of praise and a good, warm dinner. The Artful Dodger was the cleverest young thief, and Oliver Twist, escaped from the workhouse, was the latest recruit and student. Back and forth, he went in the loft, practicing his pickpocket technique under The Artful Dodger’s critical eye, following Fagin, who pretended to be a rich victim. The practicing went on for weeks. Finally, in exasperation, Fagin sneered at Oliver and said “Won’t you ever be ready? I keep waiting for you to steal my wallet, and you haven’t done a thing. It looks like no dinner for you, young Oliver! Then Oliver Twist held up his prize, Fagin’s wallet, which Oliver had cleverly extracted from his inside jacket pocket, so lightly that Fagin had not even felt its loss. “Well done, Master Oliver,” said Fagin, delightedly. “I didn’t feel a thing. You have served a fine apprenticeship and earned your dinner. Tomorrow morning, it’s your turn to put what you have learned into practice on the streets of London! You’ll go out with The Artful Dodger and with Nancy, shortly after breakfast.” Oliver smiled. Nancy was a young woman who often joined the pickpocket group as they wandered the streets of London, in search of victims. Oliver was pleased that no mention was made of Nancy’s companion, Bill Sykes, a violent man, “who, you mark my words, will come to no good end,” as Fagin often said, when Bill Sykes was not within hearing. Nancy often diverted the attention of their victims with her winsome smile, and then she vanished before the thefts were noticed. It was much better than yelling “Fire!” in a crowd and far more discreet. The next morning, right outside Simpson’s, where the wealthy would often come for a rich steak and kidney pie for luncheon, the four took up their positions in the crowd. The Artful Dodger walked slowly along the sidewalk, with Oliver two or three steps behind. Fagin approached from the opposite direction, while Nancy crossed the street at the corner, then came straight towards The Artful Dodger and Oliver. Fagin was three or four steps behind her. If everything worked well, either The Artful Dodger or Oliver would steal the passerby’s wallet or purse, depending upon which boy was closer. No clumsy moves were allowed. If neither boy was close enough to the approaching victim, they would simply wait a few minutes, go around the block, and try the entire sequence again. If Nancy was close enough, she might call to one of the boys, attracting the victim’s attention. Or The Artful Dodger might rudely point and say “What a pretty face,” hoping the victim would turn his head towards Nancy. Either way, once the wallet or purse had been taken, the thief would pass it to Nancy coming in the opposite direction. Half a block later, she would pass it to Fagin. The victim, if he or she caught on that there had been a theft, could only point out Oliver or The Artful Dodger to the police, and neither one would have the stolen property at that point. Without evidence, the chances were good that the matter would drop there. The little group of pickpockets also made sure that they would not return to the same street for several weeks. After all, there were enough rich shopping districts in London’s West End, all of which Fagin knew well, to last throughout the holiday season. Christmas Eve was a special challenge, but Fagin insisted that they go out and try their thieving luck, despite the fact that he had a raging, constant cough. The Artful Dodger was in good form and looked forward to the fine Christmas dinner that Fagin had promised as their reward after the night’s outing. Nancy wasn’t sure that she could go, because Bill Sykes was in one of his bad moods. However, Oliver looked forward to practicing his pickpocket skills, and so they set forth. The rich gentleman, their intended victim, stood outside Rule’s Restaurant looking at his gold watch, which was suspended from a thick gold chain to his vest pocket. He opened the back lid of the watch, sighed as he looked at the portrait of his missing grandson, then closed the watch and returned it to his vest pocket. The Artful Dodger and Oliver Twist approached him along the sidewalk, while Nancy and Fagin slowly made their way towards the scene from their starting points down the street. As The Artful Dodger and Oliver approached, the man unexpectedly looked up. His glance seemed to freeze The Artful Dodger, who cried “Nancy!” as she came closer. The Artful Dodger planned to grab the victim’s watch as soon as he turned - but the rich gentleman did not turn, and he stepped away from The Artful Dodger instead. Then he quickly glanced at Oliver, and his expression was one of total surprise. Could this be his lost grandson after all these years? Even in these patched clothes, the boy’s resemblance to his daughter was startling. The man gave a cry of surprise and pointed towards Oliver, then grabbed him by the wrists with his strong arms. Fagin, three feet behind Nancy, who was approaching the scene rapidly, now turned around, coughed nervously and fled the scene. Nancy, who had more poise, continued slowly towards Oliver, the gentleman and The Artful Dodger, and without making contact with either boy, proceeded down the street. A London policeman, posted just outside the restaurant, watched the scene with keen interest and came quickly. The bobby asked, “What happened, sir?” “It is a case of robbery, I think. Better take this young man into custody, until we sort out what has happened.” The policeman nodded, as he watched The Artful Dodger, Nancy and Fagin disappear into the crowd. “I’ve had my eye on that bunch,” he said. At Police Headquarters, Sergeant Cuff was amused. He had been following the gang, with Fagin, Nancy, The Artful Dodger and Oliver, for several weeks, as they shifted their location around the West End. “Patrolman Cavendish tells me that three members of the gang, the Fagin gang if I am correct, have disappeared. You have the fourth gang member here.” “Yes, but I believe that he is a victim himself, Sergeant Cuff. I don’t think that I was the victim of a crime, all things considered.” “We’ll see about that, sir. What property did you say is missing?” “Actually, I’ll let you figure out who has my wallet now, Sergeant. The missing property that is most valuable has now been found. I refer to my grandson, young Oliver here. And if you can tell me who has my watch, I will make sure that you have the finest Christmas dinner you’ve ever enjoyed!”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Fagin; (b) Nancy; (c) Oliver Twist; (d) The Artful Dodger; (e) The Rich Gentleman",
      "answer": "(e) The Rich Gentleman",
      "outcome": "The rich victim was on a mission to discover his lost grandson, Oliver, whom he recognized as one of the street thieves. His cries scared off both Fagin and Nancy, neither of whom came into any contact with The Artful Dodger or Oliver, so they could not have been passed any stolen property. The Artful Dodger missed his chance to steal the rich gentleman’s property when the intended victim did not turn his head to look at Nancy and stepped away instead.\nOliver had no chance to make the theft, because the intended victim quickly grabbed Oliver’s wrists with his powerful arms.\nThe watch never left the intended victim’s possession. By thinking quickly and alerting the police, he thought the gang members would leave, as they quickly did, and give him the chance to see if young Oliver really was his missing grandson, in the safety of the police station. To his delight, that was the case, and the restored family then celebrated their finest Christmas ever!"
