    "full_text": "Forest View House was an isolated mansion owned by an elderly man named Mr. Howard Peters. One wild, autumn night, Mr. Peters was entertaining guests and in the small hours of the morning screams awoke the occupants of the house. Miss Lucy Smith had looked out of her bedroom window and seen the limp form of Mr. Peters hanging from one of the garden trees and started to scream. Everyone rushed out to the hanging figure. After staring at it for several minutes however, they could see that it was not Mr. Peters himself but an old first aid dummy dressed in his clothes. The confused party made their way back to the house only to discover that a priceless painting had been stolen while they were outside. Since the dummy and its clothing had all been taken from the house it stood to reason that the perpetrator was someone at Forest View. The matter was made more sinister by the fact that all four guests were beneficiaries in their host’s will. Mr. Peters telephoned for the police and an Inspector, a rake thin man named Alan Jefferies, duly arrived and promptly dropped down onto the nearest chair as though the walk from his car to the door of the house had exhausted him. The Inspector displayed his ID badge to the satisfaction of everyone except Dale whose poor vision compelled him to push forward to see properly and so tread on the Inspector’s foot in the process. “Well,” said Jefferies, after he had ascertained that he did not have to add a hospital visit to the already eventful morning, “I think someone should explain to me why you are all gathered here.” “It’s like this,” Mr. Peters began. “I wanted my four closest friends to gather here for the weekend as I had business to discuss with them. They are Daisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith and Iain Potts. Daisy is my niece and she resides with me permanently; the others arrived by train yesterday evening. We all had dinner together, during which I revealed some changes to my will, and then we all retired to bed.” “What was the gist of these changes?” Inspector Jefferies broke in. “That there is no longer a fortune to be left to my four beneficiaries, at least not a very significant one, due to some bad investments I made. It was in the room where we had dinner that the missing painting was usually kept.” “Continue,” the Inspector said, noting that all the guests bristled visibly at the mention of their damaged fortunes. “Why is everyone so concerned about this painting? It’s not that valuable is it?” Lucy asked. “Very valuable, my dear,” Mr. Peters muttered. “Well,” Lucy went on, “it doesn’t seem very fair to eliminate our inheritances when you own a pricy bit of art. Why didn’t anyone tell me about it?” “You went to the bathroom,” Daisy explained to Lucy. “You weren’t there when Uncle told us about the painting. It was only a passing remark as it doesn’t affect the inheritance since it’s bequeathed to the local first aid school in Uncle’s will.” “I used to do volunteer work there,” Mr. Peters explained. “That’s why I have some equipment here in the house including the dummy that was used in this awful affair.” “I’ve been led to understand that the house was roused by Lucy’s screams,” the Inspector said. “That’s right,” Lucy replied. “I had to get up at two in the morning to take some tablets.” “Were the other guests aware of that?” Inspector Jefferies asked. “Yes they were. My windows look out onto the garden and I saw what I thought was poor Howard, murdered. I rushed out and one by one everyone else must have stumbled out of their rooms and followed to see what the matter was. I had only been staring at that frightful thing for a couple of minutes when Daisy came up behind me, Dale ran up next. It was very dark out there and all of a sudden we heard a yell and a crash. It turned out that Iain had tripped over one of the ropes used to secure what we now know was a dummy. That brought us all to our senses and we made our way back to the house.” Inspector Jefferies looked over at a man waving shyly at him from the couch with one hand and nursing his leg with the other. “Hurt badly?” Inspector Jefferies asked “Very, I’m afraid,” Iain said sadly. “Excellent,” the Inspector said, apparently unaware of the surprise in the people around him, “who discovered that it was not a real body?” “It was Dale who first made us aware of that,” Daisy replied. “We all thought it was real. It was too dark to get a clear look at the features.” “Mr. Peters, where were you during all this commotion?” Inspector Jefferies asked. “As I am rather infirm, it took me a while to get myself out of bed and down the stairs. By the time I came down everyone had returned. The nearest phone is in the dining room and so I went in there to call the police.” “We will proceed into that room Mr. Peters if you please, everyone else too,” Inspector Jefferies instructed. As soon as the group entered the dining room a small spaniel tied up on the far side of the table began to yap frantically. He showed no sign of stopping until Daisy, who was the owner of the little creature, went over and petted him until he reluctantly quietened down. “For goodness sake, Daisy, from the moment I woke up all I could hear was that canine racket and when I came in here to call the police I could hardly hear myself over his noise. He flies into a frenzy when he sees anyone other than you, you need to get him trained, there’s not a day goes by that-” “Uncle, the policeman doesn’t want to know about your domestic troubles,” Daisy said. “Oh, doesn’t he? Well, as I waited for the call to be answered I looked up at the wall here and that was when I saw that the painting had been stolen. Now, Inspector,” said Mr. Peters, “will you search the rooms?” “No,” said the Inspector, “no, I don’t think I would like to do that, your house is exceptionally large.” “-but” “Besides,” the Inspector continued, “I don’t need to search the house to tell you who took the painting.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   •  All four guests – Daisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith and Iain Potts – learned at dinner that their shares of Mr. Peters’s fortune had almost disappeared.  \n   •  The only valuable object that could compensate them is the painting that hung in the dining-room.  \n   •  Mr. Peters himself had already promised the picture to the local first-aid school, so he had no reason to steal it; the guests, however, did.\n\n2. Opportunity – timing of the theft  \n   •  The dummy outside was first seen at 2 a.m. by Lucy.  \n   •  Lucy’s scream drew everybody out of the house, leaving the dining-room unguarded for just a few minutes.  \n   •  Order of arrival at the dummy: Lucy (immediately), then Daisy, then Dale, and finally Iain – who arrived several minutes after the others and “tripped” over a rope.\n\n   Only the last person had a long enough unexplained interval inside the house to cut the picture from its frame and hide it before appearing outside: Iain Potts.\n\n3. Physical clues and alibis  \n   •  The dog.  Mr. Peters said that from the moment he woke up “all I could hear was that canine racket.”  The spaniel yaps furiously whenever it sees anyone except Daisy.  The dog therefore began barking while Daisy was already in the garden – i.e. while someone else was in the dining-room: the thief.  \n   •  Iain’s “injured” leg.  When the Inspector asked how badly he was hurt and Iain replied “Very,” the Inspector answered “Excellent.”  A painful leg would normally be bad news – unless the Inspector suspected that the bandaged or stiff trouser-leg was the perfect hiding-place for a rolled-up canvas.  The injury is a pretext to:  \n        – explain why Iain was late reaching the dummy, and  \n        – justify his remaining seated once everyone re-entered the house, keeping the stolen picture under his trouser-leg.  \n   •  No search necessary.  Jefferies refuses to search the “exceptionally large” house because he already knows the picture is not somewhere in a room – it is still on the culprit.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   (a)  The thief had to be inside the house while the others were outside.  \n   (b)  The person who stayed inside longest was Iain.  \n   (c)  The yapping dog proves the thief was not Daisy (the dog never barks at her).  \n   (d)  Iain’s convenient accident and bulky, painful leg are exactly what a thief who had just hidden a rolled-up canvas would invent.  \n   (e)  Hence Inspector Jefferies can identify the culprit without opening a single door: it is Iain Potts, and the painting is still on him.\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDaisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith, Iain Potts, Howard Peters\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nIain Potts\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Before going to bed, Iain Potts removed the first-aid dummy and dressed it in Mr. Peters’s spare clothes, then hauled it up a garden tree where it would be clearly visible from Lucy’s bedroom.  \n•  At 2 a.m. Lucy woke for her tablets, saw what she thought was Mr. Peters’s body and screamed.  \n•  Lucy rushed outside; Daisy and then Dale followed.  Iain stayed inside just long enough to slip into the dining-room, cut the picture out of its frame, roll it up tightly and thrust it down his trouser-leg.  The spaniel, confronted by a stranger, began the frenzied barking that Mr. Peters later mentioned.  \n•  Iain then ran out into the garden, deliberately tripped over one of the supporting ropes, and declared himself badly hurt.  This gave him a reason to be late on the scene and, later, a reason to sit quietly on the couch while clutching his leg – and the hidden painting.  \n•  The party returned to the house to discover the empty frame.  The police were called.  \n•  Inspector Jefferies, noticing the dog’s hostility to everyone except Daisy and the suspiciously “injured” leg of the last person to reach the dummy, realised the painting was still being worn, not hidden in a room, and named Iain Potts as the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Daisy Morris – Had she entered the dining-room the dog would not have barked, yet Mr. Peters heard constant barking.  She was also the second person in the garden, leaving no time to remove the painting.  \n•  Dale Clark – Arrived in the garden before Iain and almost immediately pointed out that the “corpse” was a dummy, urging everyone back inside – behaviour inconsistent with wanting the house empty for longer.  \n•  Lucy Smith – Was outside first and remained there from the initial scream until everyone returned; she therefore had no opportunity to enter the dining-room.  \n•  Howard Peters – The painting already belonged to a charity in his will, giving him no motive to steal it, and his slow descent from bed kept him occupied while the crime was committed.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "“It is clear to me,” the Inspector said, “that this revelation during dinner was a great blow to all four guests staying here. During dinner the conversation turns to the valuable painting and someone decides to steal it. It couldn’t have been Lucy since she was not in the room when this painting was discussed.\nThe thief knew an attempt must be made without delay. They could have sneaked downstairs and taken the painting during the night if it were not for the spaniel that barks incessantly, it would certainly wake the household if an attempt were made and give the game away. The fact that the spaniel was barking when the painting was taken proves that it was not Daisy who stole it.”\n“If I had come into the dining room my puppy would never have made a sound,” Daisy said as she patted the dog.\n“The thief set up a distraction on the lawn,” the Inspector continued,” something sufficiently terrifying to get everyone to run out of the house with no thought for anything but the apparent murder. I suspect a little bit of sinister revenge played a part in this choice of distraction since the thief was angry with Mr. Peters.\nEveryone knew that Lucy had to get out of bed and take her medicine during the night and so the dummy was placed on the lawn underneath her window in order that she would give an alarm when she saw it.\nAs we know when the alarm came everyone rushed out, except for Mr. Peters who spent a long time rising from bed. At this point the dog was already barking so the thief had snuck down first and entered the dining room as soon as they heard Lucy’s first scream, knowing that now the dog would be ignored in favour of the distraction on the lawn. The thief had only to take the painting, stash it somewhere in the house where they could get it later and then join the others.\nWhen the party ran out Iain tripped over a guide rope and hurt himself badly, he would never have had this accident if he had been aware of how the dummy was secured.”\n“Hey! I’d never have run and nearly broken my neck as well as twisting my ankle if I’d been able to help it,” Iain whined petulantly.\n“That was my point,” the Inspector said very slowly.\n“Oh, oh I see,” Iain said blushing.\n“Of course,” Inspector Jeffries said as he turned to look at Dale, “that only leaves one person.”\n“What makes you think it was me for sure?” Dale asked with a sly smile.\n“Because you demonstrated your poor eyesight when I showed my ID and yet it was you that apparently first managed to pierce the darkness with your vision and ascertain that the hanging figure was in fact a dummy.”\n“That would have been impossible,” Lucy cried.\n“Indeed it would have,” the Inspector said, “the truth of the matter is that Dale here knew that all along because he was the one that put it there.\nI think a cursory examination of the house will reveal the painting’s hiding place and if the rest of you handle your press interviews over these events sensibly I doubt that you will miss the inheritance money very much after all. Good day to you.”",

The nearest phone is in the dining room and so I went in there to call the police.” “We will proceed into that room Mr. Peters if you please, everyone else too,” Inspector Jefferies instructed. As soon as the group entered the dining room a small spaniel tied up on the far side of the table began to yap frantically. He showed no sign of stopping until Daisy, who was the owner of the little creature, went over and petted him until he reluctantly quietened down. “For goodness sake, Daisy, from the moment I woke up all I could hear was that canine racket and when I came in here to call the police I could hardly hear myself over his noise. He flies into a frenzy when he sees anyone other than you, you need to get him trained, there’s not a day goes by that-” “Uncle, the policeman doesn’t want to know about your domestic troubles,” Daisy said. “Oh, doesn’t he? Well, as I waited for the call to be answered I looked up at the wall here and that was when I saw that the painting had been stolen. Now, Inspector,” said Mr. Peters, “will you search the rooms?” “No,” said the Inspector, “no, I don’t think I would like to do that, your house is exceptionally large.” “-but” “Besides,” the Inspector continued, “I don’t need to search the house to tell you who took the painting.”",

      "answer": "(b) Dale Clark",
      "outcome": "“It is clear to me,” the Inspector said, “that this revelation during dinner was a great blow to all four guests staying here. During dinner the conversation turns to the valuable painting and someone decides to steal it. It couldn’t have been Lucy since she was not in the room when this painting was discussed.\nThe thief knew an attempt must be made without delay. They could have sneaked downstairs and taken the painting during the night if it were not for the spaniel that barks incessantly, it would certainly wake the household if an attempt were made and give the game away. The fact that the spaniel was barking when the painting was taken proves that it was not Daisy who stole it.”\n“If I had come into the dining room my puppy would never have made a sound,” Daisy said as she patted the dog.\n“The thief set up a distraction on the lawn,” the Inspector continued,” something sufficiently terrifying to get everyone to run out of the house with no thought for anything but the apparent murder. I suspect a little bit of sinister revenge played a part in this choice of distraction since the thief was angry with Mr. Peters.\nEveryone knew that Lucy had to get out of bed and take her medicine during the night and so the dummy was placed on the lawn underneath her window in order that she would give an alarm when she saw it.\nAs we know when the alarm came everyone rushed out, except for Mr. Peters who spent a long time rising from bed. At this point the dog was already barking so the thief had snuck down first and entered the dining room as soon as they heard Lucy’s first scream, knowing that now the dog would be ignored in favour of the distraction on the lawn. The thief had only to take the painting, stash it somewhere in the house where they could get it later and then join the others.\nWhen the party ran out Iain tripped over a guide rope and hurt himself badly, he would never have had this accident if he had been aware of how the dummy was secured.”\n“Hey! I’d never have run and nearly broken my neck as well as twisting my ankle if I’d been able to help it,” Iain whined petulantly.\n“That was my point,” the Inspector said very slowly.\n“Oh, oh I see,” Iain said blushing.\n“Of course,” Inspector Jeffries said as he turned to look at Dale, “that only leaves one person.”\n“What makes you think it was me for sure?” Dale asked with a sly smile.\n“Because you demonstrated your poor eyesight when I showed my ID and yet it was you that apparently first managed to pierce the darkness with your vision and ascertain that the hanging figure was in fact a dummy.”\n“That would have been impossible,” Lucy cried.\n“Indeed it would have,” the Inspector said, “the truth of the matter is that Dale here knew that all along because he was the one that put it there.\nI think a cursory examination of the house will reveal the painting’s hiding place and if the rest of you handle your press interviews over these events sensibly I doubt that you will miss the inheritance money very much after all. Good day to you.”"
