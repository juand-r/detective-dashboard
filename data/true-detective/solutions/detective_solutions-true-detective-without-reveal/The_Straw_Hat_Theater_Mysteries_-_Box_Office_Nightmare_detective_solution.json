    "full_text": "The Straw Hat Theater, nestled in Vermont’s idyllic Northeast Kingdom, was enjoying a banner season. The summer offerings, a shrewd mix of new plays and old standards, with some familiar operettas by Offenbach or Rodgers and Hammerstein thrown in for balance, routinely drew sellout crowds at each performance. Rumors that the last play to be offered, a dark comedy called, “All’s Right Now That You’re Here”, would feature a film star, increased the sense of excitement whenever summer theater fans talked about the summer’s offerings. However, Resident Director Arthur Glendon refused to comment on those rumors, rightly calculating that his non-denials would fan the rumors and continue to swell box office receipts. The current show, “Lehar’s Merry Widow”, was a perennial favorite. It made no difference that half the audience knew all of the song lyrics by heart. They could - and often did - sing along with the cast as the numbers were performed. So why was it, Arthur Glendon said to himself as he opened the day’s mail, that the theater’s bills had not been paid in full? Here, for example, was a horrendous bill from Vermont Electric and Power. It had been a warm summer, but this was northern Vermont, after all, not Jamaica! Surely the air conditioners were not on 24 hours a day! And the catering bill, which supplied snacks for the cast and food for the lodge kitchen, was too high. All told, carry-over balances from the previous month’s bills were $400. Glendon called both companies and was assured that the bills rendered were correct. The previous month’s bills had only been partially paid. Fortunately, the other bills, which also trickled in early in the month, all seemed to be in order. Then he called Basil Carmody, accountant to the Straw Hat Theater Company for years. Basil drove over to the summer theater with the account books in his briefcase. “As you know, Arthur, I pick up the cash and checks from your cashier, Martha Gilmont, every Sunday evening after the performance. I’m a season ticket holder myself and see that show every week. We count the receipts together - I sign a receipt which she countersigns, and then I deposit the money in the Vermont Enterprise Bank on Monday morning. It’s the same system that we’ve had for years. I’ve never known her to make a mistake.” “Who do you deal with at the bank?” Basil replied, “Usually Lawrence Blake, the Head Teller. He’s been with them for years.” Glendon kept pressing Basil, “Who pays the bills?” “Why, John Franklin, of course, your Treasurer.” “How does he know what the bank balances are?” “That’s easy. The Vermont Enterprise Bank is online. All John does is to log in to the account, and the information is there. He of course also has the company checkbook, which I do not. As a matter of fact, I think he - and you - are the only ones authorized to write checks for the Straw Hat Theater Company. Satisfied?” “Of course, Basil. Nothing implied. It’s just that we seem to be short, and I don’t know why. I wanted to know exactly what our procedures are, that’s all. Arthur Glendon frowned. He was not a trained investigator and didn’t want to act like one. Talking with an old, trusted friend like Basil Carmody was one thing. He couldn’t imagine calling in the local sheriff. That would really upset the entire theater staff and perhaps ruin the season. Some of the more imaginative actors might enjoy the experience, but it would not help sell tickets. Come to think of it, selling tickets wasn’t the problem! Glendon decided on a forthright approach. As soon as Martha Gilmont came into the office from her coffee break, he asked her about office procedures. “We’re just not doing as well as we should be doing, Martha. I’m trying to find out why.” She explained what he already knew, including the discounts that were offered for season tickets and the First Thursday special prices, available only with a coupon cut out from the local newspaper. She had a precise record of receipts, performance by performance. To save money the box office didn’t accept credit cards, which caused some grumbling. The proceeds were about two-thirds in cash and the rest in local checks. She even kept the coupons that were presented at the box office for ticket discounts on First Thursdays, $8 off each ticket. Each performance record was in a separate manila envelope and was countersigned by Basil Carmody. Each week, he left with her the bank receipt for the previous Monday’s deposit of cash and checks. Trying to figure out what was happening, Glendon asked Martha, “How long do you spend at the box office?” Her answer surprised him. “Until halfway through the first act. Nobody comes for tickets after that. I like to see the shows too!” “Do you make up the performance records before you leave the box office?” She turned red. “No. Everything is in the drawer, and I lock the outside door - after the performance I grab a cup of coffee and do the receipts. It’s tedious, but I’m careful. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, so I double and triple check everything!” John Franklin, the Treasurer, was surprised at the inquiry. He was by profession an actor. The few duties involved in handling the theater company checkbook were paid for by a nice stipend. He was glad to have the work, if work was the right word for writing a few checks every week. “Yes, Arthur, that’s the drill. After you see the bills, they come to me, and I write checks for payment. Of course, first I log on to the checking account at the Vermont Enterprise Bank on the office computer. And of course, I have to make sure that the checks we get have cleared before I write our own checks. That sometimes takes a couple of days. I’ll also get the monthly bank statements. The next one for this summer should be arriving in a couple of weeks.” Glendon pressed for details, “But you didn’t pay either the power company or the caterer last month in full?” John defended his actions, telling Glendon, “That’s right. There wasn’t enough money. I probably should have raised it with you, Arthur, but I thought it best to pay off all the bills I could. I thought that I could catch up this month. Is there a problem?” “I’m not sure. I hope not. I guess I’m just surprised that we aren’t doing better, given the full houses we’ve been attracting.” Lawrence Blake was a taciturn Vermonter, given to monosyllables and long silences. “Nope, I don’t handle the account any different from any other - Basil Carmody deposits the receipts on Monday mornings, and I give him a receipt. The checks come in later, of course, signed by your Treasurer. The current one is John Franklin. I saw him last year, but haven’t seen him this summer. I gather he’s got a role in “The Merry Widow”. That would be worth seeing.” Returning to the Box Office, which was an alcove with a window off the main theater office, Arthur Glendon checked the box office receipts once again. Something didn’t seem quite right. Then it came to him. As he thought, the discount coupons were xerox copies, not originals. He returned to his part of the office and sat at his desk. “This is just a one pipe problem,” he said to himself. “It wouldn’t be a great problem for Sherlock Holmes, and it certainly isn’t for me.” The trick, without solid proof, was to get reimbursement for the missing $400, and also stop the thefts from ever happening again. He was quite sure that with a low-key talk, both goals would quickly be accomplished.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. WHAT IS MISSING?  \n   – About $400 from only one month’s operations; all other bills and receipts look normal.  \n2. WHERE CAN MONEY DISAPPEAR?  \n   – Between the moment a patron buys a ticket and the moment the cash or check is deposited in the bank.  \n   – That interval is controlled solely by the box-office cashier (Martha) and, for a short time, by the accountant (Basil) and the bank.  \n3. WHAT NEW FACT DO WE GET?  \n   – All of the “First-Thursday” discount coupons in the envelopes are xerox copies—identical to one another instead of individual newspaper clippings.  \n4. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  \n   – A genuine patron would hand over an ORIGINAL coupon cut from a newspaper; no two originals would be identical.  \n   – Identical photocopies could only have been prepared in advance by a member of the staff, not by dozens of different customers.  \n5. HOW DOES THAT CREATE A SHORTAGE?  \n   – Suppose Martha pockets $8 in cash for every fake coupon she adds to the envelope.  \n   – Fifty fake coupons = $400; that exactly explains the shortage.  \n   – Basil then totals the money and coupons; everything “balances” for him, so the bank deposit and receipt also balance.  \n6. WHO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO INSERT THE FAKE COUPONS?  \n   – Only the person who physically handles the coupons before the night’s cash is locked away: the box-office cashier, Martha.  \n   – She is alone with the drawer after she locks the door and before she counts the money—ample time to add photocopied coupons and remove cash.  \n   – No one else (Basil, Lawrence, John) ever touches the coupons.  \n7. MOTIVE?  \n   – Simple personal gain: she can skim cash without creating a discrepancy in the books.  \n8. IS ANYONE AN ACCOMPLICE?  \n   – Basil merely counts what Martha hands him; the xeroxed coupons lull him into thinking the totals are correct.  \n   – No evidence shows that he or anyone else shared in the theft or even noticed the duplicated coupons.  \n9. THEREFORE: Martha Gilmont is the thief, acting alone.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMartha Gilmont, Basil Carmody, John Franklin, Lawrence Blake\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMartha Gilmont\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Each First-Thursday performance Martha prints (or xeroxes) a stack of discount coupons in advance.  \n• During ticket sales she sells full-price tickets, pockets $8 for every ticket she chooses, and later “explains” the missing cash by slipping one of her fake coupons into the envelope for that performance.  \n• After the performance she is alone in the locked box-office alcove. She counts the remaining cash, removes the skimmed amount, inserts the matching number of photocopied coupons, writes the reduced figure on the performance sheet, and seals everything in the envelope.  \n• Sunday night Basil arrives, opens the envelope with her, sees that cash, checks, and coupons reconcile with her figures, signs the receipt, and takes the reduced proceeds to the bank Monday morning.  \n• Because the shortage is disguised as legitimate discounts, the bank balances look correct to Basil, Lawrence, and later to Treasurer John—until there is no longer enough money to pay the summer’s bills in full.  \n• The fraud is exposed when Director Arthur Glendon notices that every “coupon” in the files is an identical xerox copy, an impossibility if they had been handed in by different theatergoers.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Basil Carmody: He never touches ticket money until Martha hands it to him already “balanced” with coupons. He deposits exactly what he receives and furnishes the bank’s receipt each week, showing no personal gain.  \n• John Franklin: As treasurer he merely writes checks against existing balances; he had less money because it was never deposited, not because he removed it. No evidence links him to the forged coupons.  \n• Lawrence Blake: The bank teller only accepts deposits prepared by Basil. The deposit slips and receipts match; there is no indication of tampering at the bank.  \nTherefore none of them had both the opportunity and the forged-coupon evidence that points uniquely to Martha Gilmont.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Arthur Glendon correctly suspects that the theft is an inside job. Basil Carmody and Martha Gilmont check each other’s figures. Lawrence Blake accepts the deposit, for the same amount of money. In order for the theft to succeed, the figures they certify must be inaccurate.\nThe discount coupons were xerox copies. Arthur Glendon grumbled at that, since only originals were allowed the discount. He reasoned that Basil would leave the coupon counting up to Martha Gilmont, who admittedly has poor eyesight..\nFor a thief to steal from the unattended cash box, all that was necessary was for coupons to be placed in the box, and money removed. Fifty xeroxed coupons for the First Thursday performance were put into the box, and $400 cash removed. Glendon had heard that Lawrence Blake had not seen a play that summer, and Basil Carmody’s practice was to see the Sunday evening performance. The discrepancy, however, was from the discount coupons offered for the First Thursday performance.\nJohn Franklin, the Treasurer, was the only insider who was in the position to make the switch after Martha had left the box office to see the rest of the show. As a company officer, he would have had access to the office key. As an actor, he could have noticed Martha’s habit of watching later acts of the play, and wondered whether the receipts were left in the box office. During a scene in which he was not on stage, Franklin told others that he was going outside for a smoke. He entered the office, made 50 copies of a genuine coupon, and switched the coupons for the money.\nA hint from Glendon, which stopped just short of being an accusation, led to the $400 being returned during the next performance. But this time, the receipts were locked away in the company safe, and the cash box was empty.",

All told, carry-over balances from the previous month’s bills were $400. Glendon called both companies and was assured that the bills rendered were correct. The previous month’s bills had only been partially paid. Fortunately, the other bills, which also trickled in early in the month, all seemed to be in order. Then he called Basil Carmody, accountant to the Straw Hat Theater Company for years. Basil drove over to the summer theater with the account books in his briefcase. “As you know, Arthur, I pick up the cash and checks from your cashier, Martha Gilmont, every Sunday evening after the performance. I’m a season ticket holder myself and see that show every week. We count the receipts together - I sign a receipt which she countersigns, and then I deposit the money in the Vermont Enterprise Bank on Monday morning. It’s the same system that we’ve had for years. I’ve never known her to make a mistake.” “Who do you deal with at the bank?” Basil replied, “Usually Lawrence Blake, the Head Teller. He’s been with them for years.” Glendon kept pressing Basil, “Who pays the bills?” “Why, John Franklin, of course, your Treasurer.” “How does he know what the bank balances are?” “That’s easy. The Vermont Enterprise Bank is online. All John does is to log in to the account, and the information is there. He of course also has the company checkbook, which I do not. As a matter of fact, I think he - and you - are the only ones authorized to write checks for the Straw Hat Theater Company. Satisfied?” “Of course, Basil. Nothing implied. It’s just that we seem to be short, and I don’t know why. I wanted to know exactly what our procedures are, that’s all. Arthur Glendon frowned. He was not a trained investigator and didn’t want to act like one. Talking with an old, trusted friend like Basil Carmody was one thing. He couldn’t imagine calling in the local sheriff. That would really upset the entire theater staff and perhaps ruin the season. Some of the more imaginative actors might enjoy the experience, but it would not help sell tickets. Come to think of it, selling tickets wasn’t the problem! Glendon decided on a forthright approach. As soon as Martha Gilmont came into the office from her coffee break, he asked her about office procedures. “We’re just not doing as well as we should be doing, Martha. I’m trying to find out why.” She explained what he already knew, including the discounts that were offered for season tickets and the First Thursday special prices, available only with a coupon cut out from the local newspaper. She had a precise record of receipts, performance by performance. To save money the box office didn’t accept credit cards, which caused some grumbling. The proceeds were about two-thirds in cash and the rest in local checks. She even kept the coupons that were presented at the box office for ticket discounts on First Thursdays, $8 off each ticket. Each performance record was in a separate manila envelope and was countersigned by Basil Carmody. Each week, he left with her the bank receipt for the previous Monday’s deposit of cash and checks. Trying to figure out what was happening, Glendon asked Martha, “How long do you spend at the box office?” Her answer surprised him. “Until halfway through the first act. Nobody comes for tickets after that. I like to see the shows too!” “Do you make up the performance records before you leave the box office?” She turned red. “No. Everything is in the drawer, and I lock the outside door - after the performance I grab a cup of coffee and do the receipts. It’s tedious, but I’m careful. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, so I double and triple check everything!” John Franklin, the Treasurer, was surprised at the inquiry. He was by profession an actor. The few duties involved in handling the theater company checkbook were paid for by a nice stipend. He was glad to have the work, if work was the right word for writing a few checks every week. “Yes, Arthur, that’s the drill. After you see the bills, they come to me, and I write checks for payment. Of course, first I log on to the checking account at the Vermont Enterprise Bank on the office computer. And of course, I have to make sure that the checks we get have cleared before I write our own checks. That sometimes takes a couple of days. I’ll also get the monthly bank statements. The next one for this summer should be arriving in a couple of weeks.” Glendon pressed for details, “But you didn’t pay either the power company or the caterer last month in full?” John defended his actions, telling Glendon, “That’s right. There wasn’t enough money. I probably should have raised it with you, Arthur, but I thought it best to pay off all the bills I could. I thought that I could catch up this month. Is there a problem?” “I’m not sure. I hope not. I guess I’m just surprised that we aren’t doing better, given the full houses we’ve been attracting.” Lawrence Blake was a taciturn Vermonter, given to monosyllables and long silences. “Nope, I don’t handle the account any different from any other - Basil Carmody deposits the receipts on Monday mornings, and I give him a receipt. The checks come in later, of course, signed by your Treasurer. The current one is John Franklin. I saw him last year, but haven’t seen him this summer. I gather he’s got a role in “The Merry Widow”. That would be worth seeing.” Returning to the Box Office, which was an alcove with a window off the main theater office, Arthur Glendon checked the box office receipts once again. Something didn’t seem quite right. Then it came to him. As he thought, the discount coupons were xerox copies, not originals. He returned to his part of the office and sat at his desk. “This is just a one pipe problem,” he said to himself. “It wouldn’t be a great problem for Sherlock Holmes, and it certainly isn’t for me.” The trick, without solid proof, was to get reimbursement for the missing $400, and also stop the thefts from ever happening again. He was quite sure that with a low-key talk, both goals would quickly be accomplished.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Basil Carmody; (b) John Franklin; (c) Lawrence Blake; (d) Martha Gilmont",
      "answer": "(b) John Franklin",
      "outcome": "Arthur Glendon correctly suspects that the theft is an inside job. Basil Carmody and Martha Gilmont check each other’s figures. Lawrence Blake accepts the deposit, for the same amount of money. In order for the theft to succeed, the figures they certify must be inaccurate.\nThe discount coupons were xerox copies. Arthur Glendon grumbled at that, since only originals were allowed the discount. He reasoned that Basil would leave the coupon counting up to Martha Gilmont, who admittedly has poor eyesight..\nFor a thief to steal from the unattended cash box, all that was necessary was for coupons to be placed in the box, and money removed. Fifty xeroxed coupons for the First Thursday performance were put into the box, and $400 cash removed. Glendon had heard that Lawrence Blake had not seen a play that summer, and Basil Carmody’s practice was to see the Sunday evening performance. The discrepancy, however, was from the discount coupons offered for the First Thursday performance.\nJohn Franklin, the Treasurer, was the only insider who was in the position to make the switch after Martha had left the box office to see the rest of the show. As a company officer, he would have had access to the office key. As an actor, he could have noticed Martha’s habit of watching later acts of the play, and wondered whether the receipts were left in the box office. During a scene in which he was not on stage, Franklin told others that he was going outside for a smoke. He entered the office, made 50 copies of a genuine coupon, and switched the coupons for the money.\nA hint from Glendon, which stopped just short of being an accusation, led to the $400 being returned during the next performance. But this time, the receipts were locked away in the company safe, and the cash box was empty."
