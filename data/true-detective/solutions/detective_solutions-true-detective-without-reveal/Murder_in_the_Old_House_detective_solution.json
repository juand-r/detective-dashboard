    "full_text": "Todd Jensen recently inherited the old Jensen family home. He and his wife, Anne, were busy with repairs and remodeling. It was a wonderful inheritance, as the home, built in 1910, was surprisingly modern in design. So, it was on a bitterly cold and dark winter day that Todd sat across from his beloved cousin, Charlene, who had come for a visit. Todd took his seat after pouring steaming mugs of hot chocolate. He began to relate the story he had promised her. He did not tell her there would be a challenge as well … Todd took his first sip of hot chocolate and said, “Thanks for coming. There are some things you need to know.” Todd and Charlene were more than cousins. They had been best friends and confidants for over 30 years – since they were both toddlers in diapers. Charlene replied, “No problem, Todd. What’s on your mind?” Todd took a deep breath. “Well, Anne and I found an old letter. It was pasted on the wall behind the wallpaper in the formal dining room. It was signed my Mildrid Jensen and dated May 25, 1925. She claims her husband Earl was murdered by their son, Edward Jensen. Charlene exclaimed, almost choking on a sip of hot chocolate, “That’s our great-uncle!” “Yeah, I know, replied Todd, dryly, “and she said Edward was murdered in one of the upstairs rooms. Thoughtfully, Charlene answered, “There are four bedrooms, plus a bath upstairs. Which room was it?” Pausing for a moment, she asked, “Are you going to tell the police? What about the rest of the family?” Slowly, Todd answered, “This happened almost 84 years ago. Everyone in that generation is long passed. I believe it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie.” Charlene understood perfectly. She nodded her head and asked, “Why tell me?” “You know that I share everything with you. Besides,” he grinned, “I have a challenge for you.” “What would that be? asked his cousin. “I will tell you the rest of the story, and you tell me what room great-grandfather was murdered in.” He and Charlene played mystery games as children, and now they had an opportunity to analyze a real Jensen family murder mystery. Charlene nodded and told him to continue. Todd began relating his tale. “According to great-grandmother’s letter, Edward killed Earl in a fit of rage. It was about 10:00 p.m. on a spring evening. He was found slumped over in a chair with a knife mark in his neck.” “Why did he kill his own father?” “Mildrid indicated that Edward was what they called in those days, a ‘no-account.’ He was a cocksure 20-year-old who spent too much money and had a violent temper. The letter also says he had gotten a young woman pregnant out of wedlock. That was a serious taboo back then – so serious that it could, and often did, ruin an entire family’s reputation. Anyway, Earl and Edward argued about it. The disagreement was so severe that Earl lost his life because of it.” “May I see the letter?” “After you solve the mystery,” Todd grinned. Both sipped hot chocolate, which was now cool enough to drink. Charlene returned her cousin’s smile and said, “OK. Great-grandfather was murdered. It was covered up and nobody except Mildrid knew of it until you and Anne found the letter while remodeling the dining room?” “As far as we know, that is correct.” “Was he murdered in the same room where he was found?” “Yes.” “All right, what about the other family members? “Mildrid wrote that Anita was terrified and locked herself into her room when the argument began.” “Where was Mildrid?” Todd was pleased that his cousin was warming to her task. “She was downstairs and very frightened, but close to the stairs.” Charlene said, “Tell me about the upstairs bath.” “One of the nicest of its day,” said Todd. “As you know, it was large and even contained a small chair and reading table. It had state of the art plumbing and was one of the first to have a showerhead. The mint colored tile and enamel was very rare then as well.” “Harry … Edward … where were they?” “Harry was not in the house that night. He was estranged from the family in the 1920s. I know this because Dad and Mom used to speak of it. One night, he had a moving truck come and take everything from his room. Harry’s room was empty for a number of years. As far as Edward goes, he was home that night. Mildred did not say where he was when the murder took place.” Todd refilled both cups with fresh chocolate. Charlene considered what she had heard for several minutes while Todd awaited her next question. Finally, she said, “A violent stabbing would have generated a lot of blood. Did any of the upstairs rooms have carpeting?” “Yes,” answered Todd. Edward and Anita’s rooms had carpet. In fact, new carpet had been installed in those rooms shortly before the killing. Mildred and Earl, as Ann and I are now, were doing some remodeling. The house was 15 years old in 1925 and was due for a bit of a facelift. Remember when we were kids? As late as 1983, the original carpets were still in both Edward and Anita’s rooms. They were over 55 years old.” “What about the master bedroom?” “The master bedroom was, for a prominent family such as ours was back then, fairly Spartan. Within the master bedroom there were twin beds, an armoire, a chest of drawers and a small vanity and stool for great-grandmother. No carpeting and, if I recall, they never even had throw rugs to keep their feet warm in the wintertime.” Charlene and Todd sat silent for what seemed a long time. Both finished a second cup of hot chocolate. Finally, Todd asked, “In which room was great-grandfather murdered.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. List every person known to be in or around the house that night.\n   • Earl Jensen – the victim  \n   • Mildrid Jensen – Earl’s wife, downstairs near the foot of the stairs  \n   • Edward Jensen – 20-year-old son, at home somewhere upstairs  \n   • Anita Jensen – daughter, said to have locked herself in her own room  \n   • Harry Jensen – the oldest son; estranged and not living at home  \n\n2. Consider motive.\n   • Edward: strong motive – he had got a girl pregnant, was being taken to task by his father and had a history of violent temper.  \n   • Mildrid: no motive is mentioned; would need a hidden grievance.  \n   • Anita: no known motive.  \n   • Harry: not even present.\n\n   Motive most clearly fits Edward.\n\n3. Consider opportunity.\n   • Only the three people actually in the house (Edward, Anita, Mildrid) had opportunity.  \n   • Anita states she was locked in her room; that alibi comes solely from Mildrid’s letter, but there is no reason for Mildrid to invent an alibi for Anita if she were shifting blame to Edward.  \n   • Mildrid was downstairs – physically possible but she would have had to come upstairs, stab her husband, then get back downstairs fast enough to pretend panic.  Nothing indicates she was splattered with blood or seen washing up.  \n   • Edward was already upstairs, exactly where the crime occurred.  He had easiest access and no need to sneak past anyone.\n\n4. Look at physical clues about the room.\n   • A neck stabbing produces a lot of blood.  Carpets would have shown stains forever.  \n   • Edward’s and Anita’s rooms had brand-new carpet that survived unchanged into the 1980s – so the killing cannot have been in either of those two rooms.  \n   • Harry’s abandoned room had bare floors, but the quarrel was between Earl and Edward, so there is no reason the argument would have moved into the empty room.  \n   • The master bedroom had no carpet but did have a small vanity stool – Earl could be “slumped over in a chair/stool,” and bare floor makes cleanup feasible.  \n   • The only other carpet-free area with a chair is the big upstairs bathroom, which contained a chair and reading table and, being tiled, would be still easier to wash clean.  \n   • Either the master bedroom or the bathroom therefore fits, but the description “slumped over in a chair” matches the bathroom’s arm-chair-and-table nook perfectly, whereas the master bedroom had only a backless vanity stool.\n\n   Conclusion: the murder room was the upstairs bathroom – tiled, easy to wash, complete with a chair.\n\n5. Does the choice of room say anything about the killer?\n   • A hot-headed twenty-year-old in a rage could easily lash out while the argument raged in the bathroom (perhaps Earl followed Edward in while the son tried to cool off or clean up).  \n   • Selecting a room because it is easy to wash is not necessarily evidence of premeditation; it can be accidental good fortune that the fight took place there.  \n   • Therefore the room itself does not exonerate Edward.\n\n6. Re-examine Mildrid’s letter.\n   • If Mildrid were the real killer, it would be safer simply never to mention the homicide.  \n   • Writing a letter and hiding it merely records her conscience while pointing at Edward – the most believable culprit – consistent with a frightened spouse who still wants the truth preserved for posterity.  \n   • Nothing in the story contradicts Edward’s guilt; the letter’s existence does not, by itself, prove it false.\n\n7. Eliminate other suspects.\n   • Harry was absent.  \n   • Anita’s only “involvement” is Mildrid’s claim that she locked herself away – even if that were untrue, Anita has no motive.  \n   • Mildrid had chance but no shown motive and gained nothing by Earl’s death except widowhood; meanwhile Edward had a powerful, documented motive.\n\nFinal logical deduction: Edward Jensen stabbed his father Earl in the upstairs bathroom; Mildrid later hushed the affair up and left a hidden letter in hopes the family would one day know the truth.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEdward Jensen, Mildrid Jensen, Anita Jensen, Harry Jensen\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nEdward Jensen\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate on the night of 25 May 1925, Earl confronted his 20-year-old son Edward about having made a young woman pregnant and shaming the family.  Tempers flared.  The quarrel moved into—or began in—the large upstairs bathroom, which had a chair and a reading table.  In a burst of rage Edward seized a knife (possibly his own or a straight-razor kept in the bathroom), slashed his father’s neck and left him bleeding out, slumped over the chair.  Realizing what he had done, Edward panicked.  Mildrid, hearing the struggle from downstairs, rushed up.  When she saw her husband dead and her son hysterical, she decided that the scandal of patricide on top of Edward’s existing disgrace would destroy the family.  Together, or with Mildrid directing, they washed the blood from the tiled bathroom, carried Earl’s body to his bed to make the death appear natural, and swore Anita to silence.  No police inquiry ever occurred.  Months later Mildrid, unable to live with the secret but equally unwilling to expose the family while they lived, wrote a letter explaining everything, sealed it behind new dining-room wallpaper, and went to her grave with the secret still hidden.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mildrid Jensen – Had opportunity but no demonstrated motive; writing a letter blaming her own son is exactly what an eyewitness, not the killer, would do if she wanted the truth recorded yet concealed from public scandal.  \n• Anita Jensen – Was a young daughter with no grievance against her father; is reported (by the only first-hand witness) to have locked herself in her room, and there is no evidence contradicting that.  \n• Harry Jensen – Was living elsewhere and not even present on the night of the murder, giving him a solid alibi.  \nWith motive, opportunity, and an eyewitness accusation all pointing squarely at him, only Edward fits as the killer.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Charlene looked into her empty cup and began to speak. “The murder was not in Anita’s room. She was locked in for the duration of the argument and killing. It was not in Harry’s room, either. An empty room would contain no chair for Earl to be found slumped over in. The same goes for the master bedroom – it contained a stool for great-grandmother, but no chair. Edward’s room would not still have bloody carpet on the floor in 1983 from a 1925 murder – no matter how hard you would try to clean it up, you would not keep it for over half a century. So, it had to be the bathroom, where there was a chair available to place great-grandfather and nothing but tile and enamel on the floor and walls. It would have been very easy to clean any kind of spill, blood included, in that bathroom.”\nPortion of a letter dated May 25, 1925 by Mildred Jensen:\nYesterday I hired a man to paper the dining room. I told him I wanted to paste this letter on the wall and paper over it, as a time capsule for future generations. He thought that was a nice idea and enthusiastically agreed to do as I requested.\nHe would be shocked if he knew what I am about to say, as would other family members (not to mention the police). Simply put, our son Edward murdered his father after a violent argument. Edward got a young girl pregnant and his father threatened to disown him. Edward stabbed him in the neck with a hunting knife. They were arguing in the upstairs hall and Earl slapped Edward. Edward lost all reason, went to his room to retrieve his knife, came back to the hall and pushed his father into the bathroom where he stabbed him. Fortunately for Edward – and the family’s reputation – Earl bled to death on the tile floor where it was easy to clean up.\nOur family was prominent – very prominent – in those days. It did not take much to convince our family doctor to state that Earl died of natural causes – a heart attack when becoming unduly agitated with our son.\nI saw the argument and Earl’s murder with my own terrified eyes. I could not bring myself to turn in Edward or to put our family through two messy scandals.\nStill, my wish is that somebody, someday, will know the truth through this letter.\nEarl Jensen was murdered by his own son in the upstairs bathroom. Edward and I cleaned his body, put fresh clothes on him and placed the body in a chair by the sink, making it look like he had gone into the “reading room” to remove his clothes and prepare for bed. We covered the knife wound with makeup. Doc Hartley, when he saw the body, asked no questions (quite possibly because he did not want to).",

The mint colored tile and enamel was very rare then as well.” “Harry … Edward … where were they?” “Harry was not in the house that night. He was estranged from the family in the 1920s. I know this because Dad and Mom used to speak of it. One night, he had a moving truck come and take everything from his room. Harry’s room was empty for a number of years. As far as Edward goes, he was home that night. Mildred did not say where he was when the murder took place.” Todd refilled both cups with fresh chocolate. Charlene considered what she had heard for several minutes while Todd awaited her next question. Finally, she said, “A violent stabbing would have generated a lot of blood. Did any of the upstairs rooms have carpeting?” “Yes,” answered Todd. Edward and Anita’s rooms had carpet. In fact, new carpet had been installed in those rooms shortly before the killing. Mildred and Earl, as Ann and I are now, were doing some remodeling. The house was 15 years old in 1925 and was due for a bit of a facelift. Remember when we were kids? As late as 1983, the original carpets were still in both Edward and Anita’s rooms. They were over 55 years old.” “What about the master bedroom?” “The master bedroom was, for a prominent family such as ours was back then, fairly Spartan. Within the master bedroom there were twin beds, an armoire, a chest of drawers and a small vanity and stool for great-grandmother. No carpeting and, if I recall, they never even had throw rugs to keep their feet warm in the wintertime.” Charlene and Todd sat silent for what seemed a long time. Both finished a second cup of hot chocolate. Finally, Todd asked, “In which room was great-grandfather murdered.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Bathroom; (b) Bedroom of daughter, Anita Jensen; (c) Bedroom of oldest son, Harry Jensen; (d) Bedroom of youngest son, Edward Jensen; (e) Master bedroom of Earl and Mildrid Jensen",
      "answer": "(a) Bathroom",
      "outcome": "Charlene looked into her empty cup and began to speak. “The murder was not in Anita’s room. She was locked in for the duration of the argument and killing. It was not in Harry’s room, either. An empty room would contain no chair for Earl to be found slumped over in. The same goes for the master bedroom – it contained a stool for great-grandmother, but no chair. Edward’s room would not still have bloody carpet on the floor in 1983 from a 1925 murder – no matter how hard you would try to clean it up, you would not keep it for over half a century. So, it had to be the bathroom, where there was a chair available to place great-grandfather and nothing but tile and enamel on the floor and walls. It would have been very easy to clean any kind of spill, blood included, in that bathroom.”\nPortion of a letter dated May 25, 1925 by Mildred Jensen:\nYesterday I hired a man to paper the dining room. I told him I wanted to paste this letter on the wall and paper over it, as a time capsule for future generations. He thought that was a nice idea and enthusiastically agreed to do as I requested.\nHe would be shocked if he knew what I am about to say, as would other family members (not to mention the police). Simply put, our son Edward murdered his father after a violent argument. Edward got a young girl pregnant and his father threatened to disown him. Edward stabbed him in the neck with a hunting knife. They were arguing in the upstairs hall and Earl slapped Edward. Edward lost all reason, went to his room to retrieve his knife, came back to the hall and pushed his father into the bathroom where he stabbed him. Fortunately for Edward – and the family’s reputation – Earl bled to death on the tile floor where it was easy to clean up.\nOur family was prominent – very prominent – in those days. It did not take much to convince our family doctor to state that Earl died of natural causes – a heart attack when becoming unduly agitated with our son.\nI saw the argument and Earl’s murder with my own terrified eyes. I could not bring myself to turn in Edward or to put our family through two messy scandals.\nStill, my wish is that somebody, someday, will know the truth through this letter.\nEarl Jensen was murdered by his own son in the upstairs bathroom. Edward and I cleaned his body, put fresh clothes on him and placed the body in a chair by the sink, making it look like he had gone into the “reading room” to remove his clothes and prepare for bed. We covered the knife wound with makeup. Doc Hartley, when he saw the body, asked no questions (quite possibly because he did not want to)."
