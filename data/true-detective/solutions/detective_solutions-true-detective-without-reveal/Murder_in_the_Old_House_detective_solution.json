    "full_text": "Todd Jensen recently inherited the old Jensen family home. He and his wife, Anne, were busy with repairs and remodeling. It was a wonderful inheritance, as the home, built in 1910, was surprisingly modern in design. So, it was on a bitterly cold and dark winter day that Todd sat across from his beloved cousin, Charlene, who had come for a visit. Todd took his seat after pouring steaming mugs of hot chocolate. He began to relate the story he had promised her. He did not tell her there would be a challenge as well … Todd took his first sip of hot chocolate and said, “Thanks for coming. There are some things you need to know.” Todd and Charlene were more than cousins. They had been best friends and confidants for over 30 years – since they were both toddlers in diapers. Charlene replied, “No problem, Todd. What’s on your mind?” Todd took a deep breath. “Well, Anne and I found an old letter. It was pasted on the wall behind the wallpaper in the formal dining room. It was signed my Mildrid Jensen and dated May 25, 1925. She claims her husband Earl was murdered by their son, Edward Jensen. Charlene exclaimed, almost choking on a sip of hot chocolate, “That’s our great-uncle!” “Yeah, I know, replied Todd, dryly, “and she said Edward was murdered in one of the upstairs rooms. Thoughtfully, Charlene answered, “There are four bedrooms, plus a bath upstairs. Which room was it?” Pausing for a moment, she asked, “Are you going to tell the police? What about the rest of the family?” Slowly, Todd answered, “This happened almost 84 years ago. Everyone in that generation is long passed. I believe it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie.” Charlene understood perfectly. She nodded her head and asked, “Why tell me?” “You know that I share everything with you. Besides,” he grinned, “I have a challenge for you.” “What would that be? asked his cousin. “I will tell you the rest of the story, and you tell me what room great-grandfather was murdered in.” He and Charlene played mystery games as children, and now they had an opportunity to analyze a real Jensen family murder mystery. Charlene nodded and told him to continue. Todd began relating his tale. “According to great-grandmother’s letter, Edward killed Earl in a fit of rage. It was about 10:00 p.m. on a spring evening. He was found slumped over in a chair with a knife mark in his neck.” “Why did he kill his own father?” “Mildrid indicated that Edward was what they called in those days, a ‘no-account.’ He was a cocksure 20-year-old who spent too much money and had a violent temper. The letter also says he had gotten a young woman pregnant out of wedlock. That was a serious taboo back then – so serious that it could, and often did, ruin an entire family’s reputation. Anyway, Earl and Edward argued about it. The disagreement was so severe that Earl lost his life because of it.” “May I see the letter?” “After you solve the mystery,” Todd grinned. Both sipped hot chocolate, which was now cool enough to drink. Charlene returned her cousin’s smile and said, “OK. Great-grandfather was murdered. It was covered up and nobody except Mildrid knew of it until you and Anne found the letter while remodeling the dining room?” “As far as we know, that is correct.” “Was he murdered in the same room where he was found?” “Yes.” “All right, what about the other family members? “Mildrid wrote that Anita was terrified and locked herself into her room when the argument began.” “Where was Mildrid?” Todd was pleased that his cousin was warming to her task. “She was downstairs and very frightened, but close to the stairs.” Charlene said, “Tell me about the upstairs bath.” “One of the nicest of its day,” said Todd. “As you know, it was large and even contained a small chair and reading table. It had state of the art plumbing and was one of the first to have a showerhead. The mint colored tile and enamel was very rare then as well.” “Harry … Edward … where were they?” “Harry was not in the house that night. He was estranged from the family in the 1920s. I know this because Dad and Mom used to speak of it. One night, he had a moving truck come and take everything from his room. Harry’s room was empty for a number of years. As far as Edward goes, he was home that night. Mildred did not say where he was when the murder took place.” Todd refilled both cups with fresh chocolate. Charlene considered what she had heard for several minutes while Todd awaited her next question. Finally, she said, “A violent stabbing would have generated a lot of blood. Did any of the upstairs rooms have carpeting?” “Yes,” answered Todd. Edward and Anita’s rooms had carpet. In fact, new carpet had been installed in those rooms shortly before the killing. Mildred and Earl, as Ann and I are now, were doing some remodeling. The house was 15 years old in 1925 and was due for a bit of a facelift. Remember when we were kids? As late as 1983, the original carpets were still in both Edward and Anita’s rooms. They were over 55 years old.” “What about the master bedroom?” “The master bedroom was, for a prominent family such as ours was back then, fairly Spartan. Within the master bedroom there were twin beds, an armoire, a chest of drawers and a small vanity and stool for great-grandmother. No carpeting and, if I recall, they never even had throw rugs to keep their feet warm in the wintertime.” Charlene and Todd sat silent for what seemed a long time. Both finished a second cup of hot chocolate. Finally, Todd asked, “In which room was great-grandfather murdered.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Edward Jensen – 20-year-old “no-account,” violent temper, just argued with his father Earl about having made a girl pregnant. Clear, immediate motive.  \n   • Mildrid Jensen – Earl’s wife. No evidence of marital discord or financial benefit; her own letter blames her son. Motive unlikely.  \n   • Anita Jensen – Younger sister. Terrified, locked herself in her room. No known quarrel with Earl. Motive lacking.  \n   • Harry Jensen – Estranged, moved out months earlier. Not even in the house that night. No opportunity.\n\n2. Opportunity & Location  \n   • Edward was at home and unaccounted for during the critical moment.  \n   • Anita was locked in her room.  \n   • Mildrid was downstairs, “close to the stairs,” i.e., separated by both distance and fear.  \n   • Harry—none; he was gone.\n\n3. Physical Evidence – Which upstairs room could conceal a bloody stabbing without leaving a decades-long stain?  \n   • Edward’s and Anita’s rooms had brand-new carpet that stayed in place until 1983. A stabbing in either room would have left obvious blood stains in the pile; impossible to hide for 58 years.  \n   • Harry’s vacated bedroom had no stated carpet, but it was empty and unused for years; any stains on the bare floor would have been visible the next morning. Mildrid would scarcely choose to stage the body in a bare, echoing “spare” room.  \n   • The master bedroom had bare wood floors—blood seeps between boards and is extremely hard to scrub completely away; some sign would remain.  \n   • The upstairs bath, however, was finished entirely in mint-colored ceramic tile and enamel. A bloody scene could be washed away quickly and perfectly with water—exactly what a panicked killer would need. Crucially, the bathroom contains “a small chair and reading table,” matching Mildrid’s description that Earl’s corpse was “slumped over in a chair.” None of the other rooms is said to contain a chair.  \n\n   Therefore the only logical room is the large, tiled, well-appointed upstairs bathroom.\n\n4. Logical Chain  \n   • Earl, preparing for bed, is seated in the bathroom chair, perhaps reading.  \n   • Edward follows, still furious about their argument.  \n   • He slashes his father’s neck, killing him instantly.  \n   • Because the killing happens on easy-to-wash tile, he can mop up most of the blood before anyone arrives.  \n   • Anita, locked in her room, hears only the shouting and perhaps a thud.  \n   • Mildrid, frightened downstairs, rushes up afterward, finds Edward and the body. Out of fear for the family name she helps hide the truth but in guilt writes a confession and glues it behind wallpaper.\n\nThat satisfies all clues: it preserves the 58-year-old carpets, explains the presence of the chair, and matches every family member’s stated location.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEdward Jensen, Mildrid Jensen, Anita Jensen, Harry Jensen\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nEdward Jensen\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n10:00 p.m., 25 May 1925 – Earl Jensen is seated in the upstairs bathroom’s reading chair, finishing his nightly routine.  \nEdward, enraged by their earlier fight about his having impregnated a young woman, barges in. The quarrel reignites; Anita, hearing the voices, panics and locks herself inside her carpeted bedroom. Mildrid, standing near the foot of the stairs, is too frightened to intervene.\n\nEdward’s temper explodes. He grabs a knife kept in the bathroom (perhaps from Earl’s shaving kit) and slashes his father’s neck. Earl collapses forward onto the small chair, mortally wounded.\n\nBlood spatters the mint-green tile, but tile is easy to rinse. Edward wipes the blade, turns on the new shower head and sluices water across the floor, washing most of the evidence down the waste outlet. He drags a towel over the remainder. Within minutes the scene looks merely damp, not bloody.\n\nMildrid rushes up, sees the horror, and Edward’s plea: if the truth is known, the family’s reputation, already threatened, will be destroyed. Terrified and protective, Mildrid helps conceal the crime, claiming Earl suffered a sudden accident. She later writes a private confession, hides it behind fresh dining-room wallpaper, and lives out her life with the secret.\n\nBecause the killing occurred on tile rather than carpet or bare wood, no visible stain ever betrays the concealed murder even decades later.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mildrid Jensen – Present downstairs, no motive, and her own hidden letter accuses her son; nothing contradicts her statement.  \n• Anita Jensen – Locked in her bedroom from the start; no access to Earl; no motive stated.  \n• Harry Jensen – Had removed all possessions and was physically absent that night; no opportunity.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Charlene looked into her empty cup and began to speak. “The murder was not in Anita’s room. She was locked in for the duration of the argument and killing. It was not in Harry’s room, either. An empty room would contain no chair for Earl to be found slumped over in. The same goes for the master bedroom – it contained a stool for great-grandmother, but no chair. Edward’s room would not still have bloody carpet on the floor in 1983 from a 1925 murder – no matter how hard you would try to clean it up, you would not keep it for over half a century. So, it had to be the bathroom, where there was a chair available to place great-grandfather and nothing but tile and enamel on the floor and walls. It would have been very easy to clean any kind of spill, blood included, in that bathroom.”\nPortion of a letter dated May 25, 1925 by Mildred Jensen:\nYesterday I hired a man to paper the dining room. I told him I wanted to paste this letter on the wall and paper over it, as a time capsule for future generations. He thought that was a nice idea and enthusiastically agreed to do as I requested.\nHe would be shocked if he knew what I am about to say, as would other family members (not to mention the police). Simply put, our son Edward murdered his father after a violent argument. Edward got a young girl pregnant and his father threatened to disown him. Edward stabbed him in the neck with a hunting knife. They were arguing in the upstairs hall and Earl slapped Edward. Edward lost all reason, went to his room to retrieve his knife, came back to the hall and pushed his father into the bathroom where he stabbed him. Fortunately for Edward – and the family’s reputation – Earl bled to death on the tile floor where it was easy to clean up.\nOur family was prominent – very prominent – in those days. It did not take much to convince our family doctor to state that Earl died of natural causes – a heart attack when becoming unduly agitated with our son.\nI saw the argument and Earl’s murder with my own terrified eyes. I could not bring myself to turn in Edward or to put our family through two messy scandals.\nStill, my wish is that somebody, someday, will know the truth through this letter.\nEarl Jensen was murdered by his own son in the upstairs bathroom. Edward and I cleaned his body, put fresh clothes on him and placed the body in a chair by the sink, making it look like he had gone into the “reading room” to remove his clothes and prepare for bed. We covered the knife wound with makeup. Doc Hartley, when he saw the body, asked no questions (quite possibly because he did not want to).",

      "answer_options": "(a) Bathroom; (b) Bedroom of daughter, Anita Jensen; (c) Bedroom of oldest son, Harry Jensen; (d) Bedroom of youngest son, Edward Jensen; (e) Master bedroom of Earl and Mildrid Jensen",
      "answer": "(a) Bathroom",
      "outcome": "Charlene looked into her empty cup and began to speak. “The murder was not in Anita’s room. She was locked in for the duration of the argument and killing. It was not in Harry’s room, either. An empty room would contain no chair for Earl to be found slumped over in. The same goes for the master bedroom – it contained a stool for great-grandmother, but no chair. Edward’s room would not still have bloody carpet on the floor in 1983 from a 1925 murder – no matter how hard you would try to clean it up, you would not keep it for over half a century. So, it had to be the bathroom, where there was a chair available to place great-grandfather and nothing but tile and enamel on the floor and walls. It would have been very easy to clean any kind of spill, blood included, in that bathroom.”\nPortion of a letter dated May 25, 1925 by Mildred Jensen:\nYesterday I hired a man to paper the dining room. I told him I wanted to paste this letter on the wall and paper over it, as a time capsule for future generations. He thought that was a nice idea and enthusiastically agreed to do as I requested.\nHe would be shocked if he knew what I am about to say, as would other family members (not to mention the police). Simply put, our son Edward murdered his father after a violent argument. Edward got a young girl pregnant and his father threatened to disown him. Edward stabbed him in the neck with a hunting knife. They were arguing in the upstairs hall and Earl slapped Edward. Edward lost all reason, went to his room to retrieve his knife, came back to the hall and pushed his father into the bathroom where he stabbed him. Fortunately for Edward – and the family’s reputation – Earl bled to death on the tile floor where it was easy to clean up.\nOur family was prominent – very prominent – in those days. It did not take much to convince our family doctor to state that Earl died of natural causes – a heart attack when becoming unduly agitated with our son.\nI saw the argument and Earl’s murder with my own terrified eyes. I could not bring myself to turn in Edward or to put our family through two messy scandals.\nStill, my wish is that somebody, someday, will know the truth through this letter.\nEarl Jensen was murdered by his own son in the upstairs bathroom. Edward and I cleaned his body, put fresh clothes on him and placed the body in a chair by the sink, making it look like he had gone into the “reading room” to remove his clothes and prepare for bed. We covered the knife wound with makeup. Doc Hartley, when he saw the body, asked no questions (quite possibly because he did not want to)."
