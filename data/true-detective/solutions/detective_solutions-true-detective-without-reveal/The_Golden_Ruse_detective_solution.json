    "full_text": "Jealousy and treachery had blighted the Yoxley Art Prize ever since it’s inception, there were even some who said it was cursed. The prize had been set up by the Lord of Yoxley in the late Eighteenth Century in an effort to improve his reputation as a cultural connoisseur. From its outset the event had been dogged by dishonesty, mainly due to the substantial financial reward that accompanied the winning place. Some dark rumors about how the Lord met his death had created sufficient romance to ensure that the competition endured through the years. One summer the group of hopeful artists and four judges gathered together for the competition with a certain sense of foreboding, as though some misadventure was at hand. Robert Yoxley, the modern day possessor of the title and estate, attempted to soothe his guests with a surprise buffet at afternoon tea. “Lovely day, isn’t it, Mr. Reese?” Robert asked the head judge. “It’s a lot of dashed nonsense that’s what it is, young man,” Mr. Reese gruffly replied. “Well, perhaps you would care for some refreshment from the buffet?” “Thank you, no. I’m only here because my wife insists upon it, and I’ve no wish to draw the proceedings out.” “Perhaps it would make it less tiresome if I were to suggest a change in the judging order? As you know only one judge is allowed into the showroom at any one time. You are down to go first, Mr. Reese, but I could put you last and so give you some time to attend the buffet if you wish,” Robert offered. “No, no, no, I don’t want to go last,” said Mr. Reese, “I’d rather get it over with.” “Very well, Sir, I only offered since you are such a distinguished guest. There is champagne laid out in the viewing room for our judges as well. Three very nice exhibits today; one gold, one silver and one bronze.” At that moment, to young Yoxley’s relief, the three other judges approached, they were Miss. Pendlebury, Miss. Jones and Mr. Horgan. “Hello Mr. Yoxley,” they chimed in unison. “We’re glad to finally join you,” Miss. Pendlebury said, “Mr. Horgan was so engrossed in the fresh cream tarts I thought we would never get away.” “You don’t begrudge me, surely, Miss. Pendlebury?” Mr. Horgan asked with a smile. “I begrudge the mess you’ve made of yourself with that cream,” Miss. Pendlebury said disdainfully as she looked at the marks on Mr. Horgan’s jacket. “The sooner all this idiocy is over with the better,” Mr. Reese said sharply, “show me in to the viewing room, Yoxley.” Robert scuttled in front of Mr. Reese as the old man stomped resolutely in the direction of the viewing room. “Well,” Miss. Jones said with a laugh, “I feel quite frightened now, if I take too long over my tea I’m sure Mr. Reese will accuse me of unprofessional behavior in his write up.” “When it comes to unprofessional behavior it would be strange to focus on your tea drinking when you’re dressed the way you are,” Miss. Pendlebury remarked. “What do you mean?” Miss. Jones asked. “A tight fitting dress and no jacket is hardly appropriate attire for an afternoon event. You’re not in the city now, dear.” “Well, I-,” Miss. Jones was cut short in her indignant reply by a tremendous creak from the viewing room. “Good gracious,” said Mr Yoxley as he approached, “that floorboard in the front of the gold exhibit creaks terribly. I must get it fixed. Mr. Reese is finished, Miss. Jones if you want to go in now.” Another terrific creak sounded a few minutes later and Mr. Yoxley ushered Miss. Pendlebury into the viewing room as Miss. Jones came out. “Sorry to leave you until last, Mr. Horgan.” “Oh no trouble, I can have another round of the buffet before I go in.” “No time for that,” said Miss. Pendlebury, as she suddenly appeared behind the little group. “But the board didn’t creak!” Mr. Horgan said. “Off you go,” Miss. Pendlebury snapped, coloring slightly.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What actually happened?  \n   • The genuine sculpture was made of solid gold; gold is extremely heavy and certainly does not shatter.  \n   • During the private inspections somebody removed the real gold piece and put a fragile imitation in its place.  \n   • The thief therefore had to (a) reach the pedestal, (b) have something large enough on his / her person to hide a heavy gold object, and (c) leave no obvious trace.\n\n2. The “creaking floorboard” clue  \n   • Robert Yoxley tells the judges that a loose board in front of the gold exhibit “creaks terribly”.  \n   • While the judges go in one by one he, the other judges and the servants all hear the board creak for  \n        – Mr Reese (first) and  \n        – Miss Jones (second).  \n   • When Miss Pendlebury comes out Mr Horgan immediately says: “But the board didn’t creak!”  \n   • Therefore Miss Pendlebury never stepped on the board that stands directly in front of the gold sculpture.\n\n3. Why is that important?  \n   • If she never trod on the board she never examined the gold piece from the front, i.e. never judged it at all.  \n   • Yet when the voting takes place she still votes and the gold entry wins.  \n   • The only reason to avoid the floorboard deliberately is so that nobody outside can tell she has been standing before the gold statue–exactly what she would have to do to exchange it for a fake. She must have crept to it from the side, leaning in without touching the loose plank.\n\n4. Did she have the opportunity to smuggle the real gold away?  \n   • Miss Pendlebury is the only judge actually wearing a jacket (she even scolds Miss Jones for not wearing one). A jacket with large inside pockets easily disguises a small but very heavy lump of gold; the other female judge has nowhere to hide it, and the two gentlemen would have bulging pockets.  \n   • She emerges from the room so quickly that the others are surprised—ample sign she was not really studying the works but carrying out a prepared swap.\n\n5. Weight of the object and Yoxley’s reaction  \n   • A solid-gold piece, even a small one, is noticeably heavy. Robert Yoxley does not remark on any great weight when he lifts “the gold sculpture”; it slips from his hands. That supports the idea that it was now much lighter—plaster or gilded clay—and that the theft had already taken place.\n\n6. Why Robert Yoxley says he “knew who was responsible”  \n   • Standing outside the door he has been listening for that tell-tale creak each time.  \n   • He knows it sounded for Reese and Jones, failed only for Pendlebury, and sounded again (we may take it) for Horgan.  \n   • On that simple (but conclusive) piece of evidence he identifies the only judge who demonstrably never reached the exhibit in the orthodox way—Miss Pendlebury.\n\n7. Motive  \n   • An eighteenth-century solid-gold sculpture is worth a fortune. Stealing it would be far more profitable than any bribe or fee a judge is paid. Her curt, superior manner fits someone who thinks she is clever enough to outwit the others.\n\nConclusion: Miss Pendlebury had the motive (greed), the means (a jacket to conceal the real gold), the opportunity (private access) and, most tellingly, she is the only one whose visit did not trigger the noisy floorboard.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Reese, Miss Pendlebury, Miss Jones, Mr. Horgan, Robert Yoxley\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMiss (Emily) Pendlebury\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBefore the viewing started Miss Pendlebury was already carrying a carefully gilded plaster copy of the small gold sculpture, hidden beneath her loose jacket.  \n1. Mr Reese enters first; he simply inspects the pieces—the floorboard gives a loud creak, proving he stood in front of the gold work.  \n2. Miss Jones goes next; the board creaks again.  \n3. Miss Pendlebury enters third. She knows the others outside are listening for that plank. Therefore she approaches the stand from the side, never stepping on the loose board and causing no sound. In seconds she lifts the real gold sculpture, slips it into the inside pocket of her jacket, and places her plaster duplicate on the pedestal.  \n4. She leaves quickly; outside, Mr Horgan notices that the board has not creaked, but Pendlebury briskly pushes him toward the door to keep attention off herself.  \n5. Mr Horgan goes in last; the board creaks again (not reported in the narrative but assumed), and he views only the fake piece, believing it genuine.  \n6. When the judges vote, all four—including the thief—declare the “gold” entry the best.  \n7. At the presentation Robert Yoxley lifts the sculpture, feels no special weight, begins to extol “solid and robust gold,” and the brittle imitation shatters.  \n8. Because he had been listening for that creak every time, Yoxley instantly realises that only one judge had never stood in front of the statue and must therefore have had a different purpose in the room—Miss Pendlebury. The broken imitation merely confirms the switch.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMr. Reese – The plank creaked loudly while he was in the showroom, showing he stood directly before the statue in full view of anyone outside the door. He had neither time nor a hiding place for a heavy lump of gold.  \nMiss Jones – Likewise triggered the creak; dressed in a tight, pocket-less dress and no jacket, she had nowhere to conceal the real sculpture.  \nMr. Horgan – Did not enter the showroom until after the substitution had already been made; even if he had wished to steal the gold it was no longer there.  \nRobert Yoxley – Hosted the event in the presence of all the judges and servants; if he himself had switched the statue he would hardly draw attention to the missing floorboard creak or announce that he knew who the culprit was.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
