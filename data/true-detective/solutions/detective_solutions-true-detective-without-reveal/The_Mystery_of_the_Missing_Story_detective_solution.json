    "full_text": "“It snows and everyone becomes a kid again,” Jack grumbled. While his co-workers were leaving early or acting juvenile, he was trying to piece together his interview notes. He had spoken with the governor’s son, Elliot, about a recent academic scandal in which he was accused of cheating on his exams and helping other students to cheat as well. It would end up being a top story for The Printed Voice and he wasn’t leaving work until he had finished a draft. Amy, a childish co-worker, peeked her head in the doorway. “Jack, come out and play!” She hopped in to face him, peering over the large stack of notes that filled his work area. He grabbed two handfuls of paper and held them up. “I’m trying to work. I’ve seen snow before.” “You’ve seen snow, eh? Well, do you see my hand behind my back?” she giggled. Something cold and wet smacked Jack in the face. Recovering from the partially melted snowball, he watched Amy scamper away. As he ran out of his office, he grabbed the door handle and pulled it shut, rattling it with his palm twice to make sure it had locked. Dashing through the lobby in hot pursuit, Jack nearly collided with another reporter, Lucy, while she was coming inside the building. “Excuse you!” Lucy yelled back at him. Lucy was a bitter reporter and the office gossip. Most people tried to steer clear of her. Jack, unfortunately, had bumped right into her. Jack called back a quick apology as he continued the chase. Running outside, he stepped on a patch of ice. He found himself on the ground, looking up at the winter sky. He sat back up and saw Mr. Jenkins, the custodian of the facility, standing on the sidewalk with his trash receptacle. “Glad to see you’re finally having some fun,” he called out to Jack with a grin. “This was not my idea of a break,” Jack groaned back. Mr. Jenkins shook his head again. “Well, I mopped up the mess in front of your office just a moment ago. I feel like I have been attacking wet footprints ever since it started snowing.” Jack gave him a frown of sympathy. “Sorry. That was from Amy, not me.” Mr. Jenkins sighed and gave a shrug before heading inside. Another co-worker, Sarah, stepped out right after him and burst out laughing when she saw Jack still sitting on the ground. “This is a change of scenery for you,” Sarah giggled as she stopped in front of him. “I bet you wish you’d landed Alex’s Sea World story … you’d be enjoying the sunny San Diego weather right about now!” Still dazed, Jack wasn’t exactly paying attention. Sarah adjusted her heavy shoulder bag, and waved her hand in front of his eyes, “Hello? Is anyone in there?” “Sorry,” he said, “I’m just stressed – as usual.” “I know how that is,” she replied. “… If only my name were Lucy, then, I’d be dating the boss’s son. And, then, I’d get to do whatever I wanted.” It looked like Sarah was leaving the office for a month rather than heading home early. She, like Jack, was a self-proclaimed workaholic. “The snow is coming down pretty heavy,” she added, “I have a feeling that if you want to head out, it will be OK.” “Well, I guess I better get back to work so I can go.” Jack stood up and wiped the remaining snow off of his clothes. As he was heading back into the office, a snowball hit him in the back of his head. He whirled around to find Amy sticking her tongue out at him. “Are you going to let her get away with that?” Sarah smiled as she began walking down the sidewalk toward the parking lot; she was leaving for the day. Jack retaliated with two snowball attacks of his own, and after fifteen minutes had passed, he decided it was time to retreat back into the warm building. Amy remained outside, choosing to freeze her toes for a while longer. Jack found himself stepping over miniature puddles of melted snow in front of his office. Mr. Jenkins had already cleaned up the mess left over from Amy’s snowball. Evidently everyone in the building was tracking in messy footprints without worrying about giving the custodian extra work. Jack rolled his eyes and unlocked his door. He stopped in his tracks. His desk was completely clean. Not a single paper remained. Walking inside, he stepped on something. Jack looked down and picked up a bent company ID card. The printed name on the card read: Alex Rebmevon. Alex, the official owner of the ID, was a fellow reporter at The Printed Voice. He was also the boss’s son. Back during his college days, Jack had once locked himself outside of his dorm room and used his student ID to pick the lock. Jack questioned if the door in his office was just as easy to get into. As Jack stood in the middle of the room, puzzled and angry by the intrusion, he heard a long whistle from behind. He turned to find Amy once again standing in the doorway. She nodded her head toward the immaculate desk. “Looks like you decided to get rid of that busy work, after all.” “I didn’t do this,” Jack held up the ID, “he did.” Amy snatched the card from his hand and studied it. “Well, it looks like this is what the culprit used alright. This card is wrecked.” “ … Only one way to find out,” Jack said, as he whipped out his cell phone and dialed Alex’s number. There was no answer. Amy was still standing in front of him. “Do you know who did it?” she asked. He thought back to Sarah and the massive shoulder bag she had been carrying. “Maybe,” he answered. But his eyes narrowed as he weighed in the evidence and ran through a growing list of suspects. Mr. Jenkins had a key to every office in the building. And he had walked back inside shortly before Jack, explaining the puddles at the door. They searched the building for the custodian and found him in the reception area, collecting trash. Jack explained the situation to him and asked about the missing papers. “You really think I would do that?” Mr. Jenkins said, hurt by the accusation. He continued, “Though, I’ll admit, I did use Alex’s ID card to break into the office. Jack replied quickly, “No, I don’t think you’re a suspect at all. You’ve been too busy cleaning all day. But, now that you mention it … why did you use the ID to break into my office?” “Well, I swear I didn’t touch anything on your desk, it was already clean as a whistle when I went in to collect your trash. I used my key to get in the first time, but I accidentally left my keys on your filing cabinet and had shut the locked door before I realized it. I found the ID on the floor earlier and it was already bent up. I figured it couldn’t be used anymore, so what was the harm in using it to get back in?” “So someone used the ID to break into my office before you found it then?” He thought about some of the things that had been taken and remembered his notes from the interview. Even the notes themselves would be something any other reporter at The Printed Voice would love to get his hands on. And one of them had. All of his co-workers were likely suspects.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. MOTIVE  \n • Amy – only wants to play in the snow; no reason to want Jack’s political scoop.  \n • Mr. Jenkins – no motive; the story means nothing to the custodian.  \n • Alex – 3 000 km away in San Diego covering Sea-World; and the notes would only harm his father.  \n • Sarah – is ambitious, but she complains that if she were “Lucy” she could date the boss’s son and get whatever she wanted – i.e. she is NOT dating him and is unlikely to have his ID card.  \n • Lucy – is the newsroom gossip, loves inside dirt and, according to Sarah, is dating Alex, the boss’s son.  That gives her (a) a personal motive to get hold of the explosive notes and (b) easy access to Alex’s ID badge.\n\n2. OPPORTUNITY (timed order of events)  \n 00 min Jack leaves his office, locks the door and chases Amy.  \n 01 min Lucy pushes past Jack and comes in from outside (her shoes and coat are covered with snow).  \n 01-04 min While Jack is still outside and before Mr. Jenkins reaches the corridor, Lucy is alone in the hall.  \n 04 min Lucy slides Alex’s ID between the strike plate and the bolt, bending it in the process, unlocks the door, scoops Jack’s loose-leaf notes into her coat and hurries away. When she pulls the badge free it snaps from her hand and lands on the carpet outside the office.  \n 05 min Mr. Jenkins unlocks the office with his master key to mop up the puddles Lucy’s snowy shoes left.  The desk is already bare.  \n 07 min He leaves, absent-mindedly locking his keys inside.  Looking around for something thin and plastic he spots the already-creased badge on the floor and later uses it to reopen the door, thereby explaining the further bending of the card.  \n 08 min Jenkins walks outside with the rubbish and meets the fallen Jack; Sarah then comes out right behind him and heads for her car.  \n 15 min Jack goes back in and finds the empty desk and the bent badge.\n\nOnly Lucy had the quiet two-minute window between Jack’s departure and Mr. Jenkins’s arrival, and only Lucy had a believable reason to possess Alex’s identity card.\n\n3. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE  \n • Wet footprints that Jenkins had to mop show the intruder had just come in from outside in the snow – exactly when Lucy arrived.  \n • The badly-bent badge of Alex Rebmevon was found outside the office, therefore first used by the thief and only later picked up by Jenkins.  Alex’s girlfriend Lucy is the natural person to have that badge in her pocket.  \n • Sarah’s giant shoulder bag is a red herring; her shoes would have been dry after a day indoors, so she is not the source of the fresh, wet prints.\n\n4. LOGIC  \n A thief with Alex’s pass + fresh snow on shoes + chance to act in the tiny gap before Jenkins = Lucy.  No other character fits all three requirements.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAmy, Lucy, Sarah, Mr. Jenkins, Alex\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLucy\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen Jack bolted after Amy he locked his door behind him.  Seconds later Lucy, fuming over being jostled and eager for a sensational scoop, entered the building from the snowy street.  Still wearing her wet boots and carrying her boyfriend Alex Rebmevon’s access card, she realised Jack’s office was unattended.  Using the card as a shim she popped the simple office latch, bending the plastic.  She swept all of Jack’s interview notes into her coat and hurried away, dropping the damaged badge outside the doorway.\n\nWithin minutes Mr. Jenkins arrived to mop the new puddles Lucy’s snowy shoes had left.  He found the desk already cleared, did his cleaning, but stupidly left his master-key ring on the filing cabinet.  After he pulled the door shut it re-locked.  Seeing the bent ID card on the floor and assuming it was useless, he used it to reopen the door, retrieved his keys, pocketed the card and continued his rounds.\n\nA quarter of an hour later Jack came back, unlocked the office and discovered the theft.  The only trace the thief left was Alex’s crumpled badge, which Jenkins later admitted to having used but not to having bent – it was already damaged when he found it.  The badge’s owner was in California, leaving Lucy, its likely borrower, as the only person who could have wielded it earlier.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAmy never went farther than the corridor and then stayed outside in the snow with Jack in full view for the next fifteen minutes – she had no chance to enter the office unseen.  \nMr. Jenkins had a master key and no reason to resort to an ID card unless it was already lying on the floor; he also entered AFTER the desk had been emptied.  \nAlex was on assignment in San Diego, thousands of miles away.  \nSarah was indeed carrying a bulky shoulder bag, but she left the building only after Mr. Jenkins had already been inside Jack’s office and found it stripped.  She therefore could not have committed the theft in the narrow window when it actually happened, and she had no plausible way to have Alex’s access card.  \nOnly Lucy had motive, possession of the badge, wet footwear matching the puddles Jenkins cleaned, and the brief, perfect opportunity.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

As he was heading back into the office, a snowball hit him in the back of his head. He whirled around to find Amy sticking her tongue out at him. “Are you going to let her get away with that?” Sarah smiled as she began walking down the sidewalk toward the parking lot; she was leaving for the day. Jack retaliated with two snowball attacks of his own, and after fifteen minutes had passed, he decided it was time to retreat back into the warm building. Amy remained outside, choosing to freeze her toes for a while longer. Jack found himself stepping over miniature puddles of melted snow in front of his office. Mr. Jenkins had already cleaned up the mess left over from Amy’s snowball. Evidently everyone in the building was tracking in messy footprints without worrying about giving the custodian extra work. Jack rolled his eyes and unlocked his door. He stopped in his tracks. His desk was completely clean. Not a single paper remained. Walking inside, he stepped on something. Jack looked down and picked up a bent company ID card. The printed name on the card read: Alex Rebmevon. Alex, the official owner of the ID, was a fellow reporter at The Printed Voice. He was also the boss’s son. Back during his college days, Jack had once locked himself outside of his dorm room and used his student ID to pick the lock. Jack questioned if the door in his office was just as easy to get into. As Jack stood in the middle of the room, puzzled and angry by the intrusion, he heard a long whistle from behind. He turned to find Amy once again standing in the doorway. She nodded her head toward the immaculate desk. “Looks like you decided to get rid of that busy work, after all.” “I didn’t do this,” Jack held up the ID, “he did.” Amy snatched the card from his hand and studied it. “Well, it looks like this is what the culprit used alright. This card is wrecked.” “ … Only one way to find out,” Jack said, as he whipped out his cell phone and dialed Alex’s number. There was no answer. Amy was still standing in front of him. “Do you know who did it?” she asked. He thought back to Sarah and the massive shoulder bag she had been carrying. “Maybe,” he answered. But his eyes narrowed as he weighed in the evidence and ran through a growing list of suspects. Mr. Jenkins had a key to every office in the building. And he had walked back inside shortly before Jack, explaining the puddles at the door. They searched the building for the custodian and found him in the reception area, collecting trash. Jack explained the situation to him and asked about the missing papers. “You really think I would do that?” Mr. Jenkins said, hurt by the accusation. He continued, “Though, I’ll admit, I did use Alex’s ID card to break into the office. Jack replied quickly, “No, I don’t think you’re a suspect at all. You’ve been too busy cleaning all day. But, now that you mention it … why did you use the ID to break into my office?” “Well, I swear I didn’t touch anything on your desk, it was already clean as a whistle when I went in to collect your trash. I used my key to get in the first time, but I accidentally left my keys on your filing cabinet and had shut the locked door before I realized it. I found the ID on the floor earlier and it was already bent up. I figured it couldn’t be used anymore, so what was the harm in using it to get back in?” “So someone used the ID to break into my office before you found it then?” He thought about some of the things that had been taken and remembered his notes from the interview. Even the notes themselves would be something any other reporter at The Printed Voice would love to get his hands on. And one of them had. All of his co-workers were likely suspects.",

Sarah mentioned that as she was leaving! And, it couldn’t have been Sarah, because she was doing just that – leaving. And it couldn’t have been you …”\n“Of course it wasn’t me. I stayed outside the entire time.”\n“That leaves just one person … a person close to Alex. Let’s go talk to Lucy and ask her how her new relationship with the boss’s son is going. Maybe she has the boss’s ID, too.”"
