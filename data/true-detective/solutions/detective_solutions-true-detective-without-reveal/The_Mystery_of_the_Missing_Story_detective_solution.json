    "full_text": "“It snows and everyone becomes a kid again,” Jack grumbled. While his co-workers were leaving early or acting juvenile, he was trying to piece together his interview notes. He had spoken with the governor’s son, Elliot, about a recent academic scandal in which he was accused of cheating on his exams and helping other students to cheat as well. It would end up being a top story for The Printed Voice and he wasn’t leaving work until he had finished a draft. Amy, a childish co-worker, peeked her head in the doorway. “Jack, come out and play!” She hopped in to face him, peering over the large stack of notes that filled his work area. He grabbed two handfuls of paper and held them up. “I’m trying to work. I’ve seen snow before.” “You’ve seen snow, eh? Well, do you see my hand behind my back?” she giggled. Something cold and wet smacked Jack in the face. Recovering from the partially melted snowball, he watched Amy scamper away. As he ran out of his office, he grabbed the door handle and pulled it shut, rattling it with his palm twice to make sure it had locked. Dashing through the lobby in hot pursuit, Jack nearly collided with another reporter, Lucy, while she was coming inside the building. “Excuse you!” Lucy yelled back at him. Lucy was a bitter reporter and the office gossip. Most people tried to steer clear of her. Jack, unfortunately, had bumped right into her. Jack called back a quick apology as he continued the chase. Running outside, he stepped on a patch of ice. He found himself on the ground, looking up at the winter sky. He sat back up and saw Mr. Jenkins, the custodian of the facility, standing on the sidewalk with his trash receptacle. “Glad to see you’re finally having some fun,” he called out to Jack with a grin. “This was not my idea of a break,” Jack groaned back. Mr. Jenkins shook his head again. “Well, I mopped up the mess in front of your office just a moment ago. I feel like I have been attacking wet footprints ever since it started snowing.” Jack gave him a frown of sympathy. “Sorry. That was from Amy, not me.” Mr. Jenkins sighed and gave a shrug before heading inside. Another co-worker, Sarah, stepped out right after him and burst out laughing when she saw Jack still sitting on the ground. “This is a change of scenery for you,” Sarah giggled as she stopped in front of him. “I bet you wish you’d landed Alex’s Sea World story … you’d be enjoying the sunny San Diego weather right about now!” Still dazed, Jack wasn’t exactly paying attention. Sarah adjusted her heavy shoulder bag, and waved her hand in front of his eyes, “Hello? Is anyone in there?” “Sorry,” he said, “I’m just stressed – as usual.” “I know how that is,” she replied. “… If only my name were Lucy, then, I’d be dating the boss’s son. And, then, I’d get to do whatever I wanted.” It looked like Sarah was leaving the office for a month rather than heading home early. She, like Jack, was a self-proclaimed workaholic. “The snow is coming down pretty heavy,” she added, “I have a feeling that if you want to head out, it will be OK.” “Well, I guess I better get back to work so I can go.” Jack stood up and wiped the remaining snow off of his clothes. As he was heading back into the office, a snowball hit him in the back of his head. He whirled around to find Amy sticking her tongue out at him. “Are you going to let her get away with that?” Sarah smiled as she began walking down the sidewalk toward the parking lot; she was leaving for the day. Jack retaliated with two snowball attacks of his own, and after fifteen minutes had passed, he decided it was time to retreat back into the warm building. Amy remained outside, choosing to freeze her toes for a while longer. Jack found himself stepping over miniature puddles of melted snow in front of his office. Mr. Jenkins had already cleaned up the mess left over from Amy’s snowball. Evidently everyone in the building was tracking in messy footprints without worrying about giving the custodian extra work. Jack rolled his eyes and unlocked his door. He stopped in his tracks. His desk was completely clean. Not a single paper remained. Walking inside, he stepped on something. Jack looked down and picked up a bent company ID card. The printed name on the card read: Alex Rebmevon. Alex, the official owner of the ID, was a fellow reporter at The Printed Voice. He was also the boss’s son. Back during his college days, Jack had once locked himself outside of his dorm room and used his student ID to pick the lock. Jack questioned if the door in his office was just as easy to get into. As Jack stood in the middle of the room, puzzled and angry by the intrusion, he heard a long whistle from behind. He turned to find Amy once again standing in the doorway. She nodded her head toward the immaculate desk. “Looks like you decided to get rid of that busy work, after all.” “I didn’t do this,” Jack held up the ID, “he did.” Amy snatched the card from his hand and studied it. “Well, it looks like this is what the culprit used alright. This card is wrecked.” “ … Only one way to find out,” Jack said, as he whipped out his cell phone and dialed Alex’s number. There was no answer. Amy was still standing in front of him. “Do you know who did it?” she asked. He thought back to Sarah and the massive shoulder bag she had been carrying. “Maybe,” he answered. But his eyes narrowed as he weighed in the evidence and ran through a growing list of suspects. Mr. Jenkins had a key to every office in the building. And he had walked back inside shortly before Jack, explaining the puddles at the door. They searched the building for the custodian and found him in the reception area, collecting trash. Jack explained the situation to him and asked about the missing papers. “You really think I would do that?” Mr. Jenkins said, hurt by the accusation. He continued, “Though, I’ll admit, I did use Alex’s ID card to break into the office. Jack replied quickly, “No, I don’t think you’re a suspect at all. You’ve been too busy cleaning all day. But, now that you mention it … why did you use the ID to break into my office?” “Well, I swear I didn’t touch anything on your desk, it was already clean as a whistle when I went in to collect your trash. I used my key to get in the first time, but I accidentally left my keys on your filing cabinet and had shut the locked door before I realized it. I found the ID on the floor earlier and it was already bent up. I figured it couldn’t be used anymore, so what was the harm in using it to get back in?” “So someone used the ID to break into my office before you found it then?” He thought about some of the things that had been taken and remembered his notes from the interview. Even the notes themselves would be something any other reporter at The Printed Voice would love to get his hands on. And one of them had. All of his co-workers were likely suspects.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What disappeared?  \n    – A very large stack of interview notes Jack had just finished taking.  \n    – Those notes are priceless to any rival reporter; nobody else in the building would value them as much.\n\n2. When could the theft have happened?  \n    – Jack locked his door, ran into the lobby, hit the street and stayed outside for about fifteen minutes.  \n    – When he came back the notes were gone, yet the door was still locked.  \n    – Therefore the thief entered, removed the notes and left again during that fifteen-minute window.\n\n3. How was the door opened?  \n    – Jack’s lock can be popped with a thin plastic card (Jack mentions having done exactly that in college).  \n    – A badly-bent company ID card belonging to Alex Rebmevon was lying on the floor, proving it had just been used to spring the latch.\n\n4. Who had Alex’s ID?  \n    – Alex himself is out of town on a Sea-World assignment.  \n    – Lucy is dating Alex, so she normally has access to his things – but she was outside in the snow until the very moment Jack left the building.  \n    – Anyone else would have had to steal the badge first.\n\n5. Who had both motive and opportunity?  \n    Amy – outside with Jack the whole time; no motive.  \n    Mr Jenkins – was mopping corridors and had his custodial key; he found the desk already bare when he first entered. No motive to risk his job.  \n    Lucy – wants every bit of gossip she can get, but she had no way to hide a thick pile of papers in the thin coat she was wearing, and she was only just stepping back inside when Jack rushed past her. She would have had to cross the entire lobby, pick the lock, empty the desk and relock the door all before Jenkins arrived with his cart – no more than a minute or two.  \n    Sarah – a self-confessed work-aholic reporter, jealous of Lucy’s relationship with Alex and of Alex’s “Sea-World” scoop; she alone was carrying a very large, noticeably heavy shoulder bag big enough to swallow Jack’s thick stack of notes. She was still inside when Jack dashed out, came outside moments later with that over-stuffed bag, then drove straight off the lot. She thus had (a) time alone in the corridors, (b) a container for the loot, and (c) an obvious motive: land the blockbuster cheating story herself.  \n    The clincher: while chatting with Jack she gratuitously steered the conversation toward Alex and Lucy – exactly the two people the bent ID would implicate – an obvious attempt to plant an idea in Jack’s mind before anyone discovered the break-in.\n\n6. Physical trail  \n    – Jenkins saw and mopped fresh, wet footprints leading to Jack’s door, then unlocked it with his master key and found an already-cleared desk. Those must have been Sarah’s tracks; Lucy’s shoes were still dry when she entered only seconds earlier.  \n    – The badge was already “bent up” when Jenkins later used it himself, proving it had been bent by whoever picked the lock the first time – Sarah.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAmy (no last name given), Lucy (no last name given), Sarah (no last name given), Mr. Jenkins, Alex Rebmevon\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nSarah\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Earlier in the day Sarah quietly lifted Alex Rebmevon’s spare company badge from Lucy’s desk.  \n• The moment Jack sprinted after Amy, Sarah realised she had a short, empty corridor and a perfect chance to steal Jack’s notes.  \n• Using Alex’s plastic badge she popped the latch, slipped into the office, swept the thick pile of pages into her large shoulder bag and shut the door behind her. The automatic latch re-engaged, leaving the door locked again.  \n• In the rush she dropped (or deliberately left) the now-bent badge on the floor.  \n• She then headed for the exit; on her way out she met Jack (still sitting on the icy pavement), joked with him and encouraged him to leave early, all while the stolen notes bulged inside her bag.  \n• Custodian Mr Jenkins came along next, saw the trail of wet prints, opened the still-locked office with his master key to empty the trash and found the strangely bare desk.  \n• He absent-mindedly left his key-ring inside, locked himself out, noticed the ruined badge on the floor, and later used it to open the door again—bending it even more—before dropping it on the carpet.  \n• Jack finally returned, discovered the theft and the bent badge, and started pointing fingers.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Amy – was outdoors, in Jack’s direct line of sight, the entire time the theft occurred.  \n• Mr Jenkins – admits unlocking the door but only after the desk was already cleared; he was busy mopping corridors in full view of several employees and had no reason to steal a reporter’s notes.  \n• Lucy – only just re-entered the building when Jack was already sprinting out; she lacked both time and a way to smuggle a bulky stack of pages.  \n• Alex Rebmevon – is away on assignment and never appeared at the office that day.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

And, then, I’d get to do whatever I wanted.” It looked like Sarah was leaving the office for a month rather than heading home early. She, like Jack, was a self-proclaimed workaholic. “The snow is coming down pretty heavy,” she added, “I have a feeling that if you want to head out, it will be OK.” “Well, I guess I better get back to work so I can go.” Jack stood up and wiped the remaining snow off of his clothes. As he was heading back into the office, a snowball hit him in the back of his head. He whirled around to find Amy sticking her tongue out at him. “Are you going to let her get away with that?” Sarah smiled as she began walking down the sidewalk toward the parking lot; she was leaving for the day. Jack retaliated with two snowball attacks of his own, and after fifteen minutes had passed, he decided it was time to retreat back into the warm building. Amy remained outside, choosing to freeze her toes for a while longer. Jack found himself stepping over miniature puddles of melted snow in front of his office. Mr. Jenkins had already cleaned up the mess left over from Amy’s snowball. Evidently everyone in the building was tracking in messy footprints without worrying about giving the custodian extra work. Jack rolled his eyes and unlocked his door. He stopped in his tracks. His desk was completely clean. Not a single paper remained. Walking inside, he stepped on something. Jack looked down and picked up a bent company ID card. The printed name on the card read: Alex Rebmevon. Alex, the official owner of the ID, was a fellow reporter at The Printed Voice. He was also the boss’s son. Back during his college days, Jack had once locked himself outside of his dorm room and used his student ID to pick the lock. Jack questioned if the door in his office was just as easy to get into. As Jack stood in the middle of the room, puzzled and angry by the intrusion, he heard a long whistle from behind. He turned to find Amy once again standing in the doorway. She nodded her head toward the immaculate desk. “Looks like you decided to get rid of that busy work, after all.” “I didn’t do this,” Jack held up the ID, “he did.” Amy snatched the card from his hand and studied it. “Well, it looks like this is what the culprit used alright. This card is wrecked.” “ … Only one way to find out,” Jack said, as he whipped out his cell phone and dialed Alex’s number. There was no answer. Amy was still standing in front of him. “Do you know who did it?” she asked. He thought back to Sarah and the massive shoulder bag she had been carrying. “Maybe,” he answered. But his eyes narrowed as he weighed in the evidence and ran through a growing list of suspects. Mr. Jenkins had a key to every office in the building. And he had walked back inside shortly before Jack, explaining the puddles at the door. They searched the building for the custodian and found him in the reception area, collecting trash. Jack explained the situation to him and asked about the missing papers. “You really think I would do that?” Mr. Jenkins said, hurt by the accusation. He continued, “Though, I’ll admit, I did use Alex’s ID card to break into the office. Jack replied quickly, “No, I don’t think you’re a suspect at all. You’ve been too busy cleaning all day. But, now that you mention it … why did you use the ID to break into my office?” “Well, I swear I didn’t touch anything on your desk, it was already clean as a whistle when I went in to collect your trash. I used my key to get in the first time, but I accidentally left my keys on your filing cabinet and had shut the locked door before I realized it. I found the ID on the floor earlier and it was already bent up. I figured it couldn’t be used anymore, so what was the harm in using it to get back in?” “So someone used the ID to break into my office before you found it then?” He thought about some of the things that had been taken and remembered his notes from the interview. Even the notes themselves would be something any other reporter at The Printed Voice would love to get his hands on. And one of them had. All of his co-workers were likely suspects.",

      "outcome": "“It must have been Alex,” Jack said, his cheeks turning red.\n“Alex?” Amy questioned, “Wait a minute … isn’t he in San Diego doing a story?”\n“My gosh, you’re right! Sarah mentioned that as she was leaving! And, it couldn’t have been Sarah, because she was doing just that – leaving. And it couldn’t have been you …”\n“Of course it wasn’t me. I stayed outside the entire time.”\n“That leaves just one person … a person close to Alex. Let’s go talk to Lucy and ask her how her new relationship with the boss’s son is going. Maybe she has the boss’s ID, too.”"
