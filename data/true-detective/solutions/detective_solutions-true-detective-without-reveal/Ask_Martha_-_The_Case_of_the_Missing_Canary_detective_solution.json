    "full_text": "Disorder wasn’t the word for it. When I arrived at the Carstairs residence for a long anticipated dinner, my hostess was distraught. She was upstairs, and her husband, James Carstairs, greeted me, an alarmed expression on his face. “It’s her favorite canary,” he said. “Or rather, it was her favorite canary, a real chirpy one. Rufus was his name. Don’t ask me why.” He led me into the music room, which looked out onto the garden. A metal canary cage had been knocked off its table and lay on its side on the floor. The little door was opened, the latch sprung. There was no trace of the canary. An open window gave the obvious answer. Somehow, the canary cage had been knocked off its perch and fallen to the floor, breaking the latch and opening the cage door. Mr. Carstairs leaned forward and said that his wife had gone upstairs as soon as she had entered the music room to arrange the flowers and discovered the missing canary, some twenty minutes earlier. I was early to dinner, hoping to talk about my columns for the Chronicle. Oh yes, I should have mentioned that Mr. Carstairs is my boss at the newspaper, which he owns and also runs as Managing Editor. The newspaper had had rather a good year, unlike most newspapers, and this dinner party was to have been a celebration. The other guests would be arriving in half an hour, and the cook was putting the finishing touches on the dinner that we would soon be enjoying, if this canary disappearance could be sorted out, Mr. Carstairs said. “Maybe this could be one of your mysteries. You know, interview people, do what you have to do. Just like Martha would do.” He was referring to the advice column that I wrote for the Chronicle, under the Ask Martha byline. It was a more credible byline than Crusher Davis, my real nickname, and the one I used for reporting sports news. Crusher probably went better with my six foot six frame and two-hundred-sixty-five pounds. Anyway, the real Ask Martha identity was a well-kept secret with just Carstairs, Inspector Samuels of the local police and the newspaper secretary in the know. “That means interviewing your own family, Mr. Carstairs.” “So be it. I hate cold dinners. And I really hate having no dinner at all!” “Who was in this room, or near it, when the cage fell?” “We do know that. The maid, Marjorie, was here an hour ago. She reported that everything was normal. The children, Jimmy and Lydia, were playing outside with the neighbor’s boy, Alex Johnston. They’re still outside.” I looked around the room carefully. There were a few mud stains by the French doors facing inwards, which traced the outline of a shoe, and here and there were a few strands of grass. My attention was attracted by a squeaky yawn, and over against the far wall, a large orange cat sleepily shook herself awake. “And, of course, Sarabelle was here too,” said Mr. Carstairs. “She’s seventeen now, has a touch of arthritis and spends most of her time asleep, when she isn’t eating. Now I’ll go and see how my wife is doing.” I opened the French doors to the garden, and saw the three children playing frisbee, right outside the house. They were in Middle School, what used to be called Junior High, I’d say. Jimmy and Alex were trying to keep the frisbee away from Lydia, who was between them, jumping for the frisbee whenever they would toss it, just over her head. “No fair,” cried an exasperated Lydia, “you two meanies haven’t let me catch the frisbee even once. This isn’t any fun at all!” Jimmy, who was playing barefoot, saw me first. “Hi, Crusher! Want to join us?” “Thanks, Jimmy. I’m on a case. Actually, you can all help.” They all looked sheepishly at each other. “Snitching isn’t right,” said Jimmy. “That’s true. But if it’s a game, it will be all right. If I tell you what happened, you can tell me if I got it right, can’t you?” They thought this over. “Is it okay if we don’t exactly tell you what happened?” “Sure. Why not? That happens all the time in my real cases, anyway.” The children huddled together, made plans and laughed. Alex had a question. “But what happens if none of us did it?” “Did what, Alex?” They all turned red. “Okay, Crusher, you’ve got us there.” “Yes. Well, the canary is missing. The cage was knocked off its perch. It fell, and the door latch came undone. The canary, Rufus, flew away. That’s all pretty clear. How did it happen, that’s what I want to know.” Alex finally answered. “Well, I was running to catch a frisbee toss over by the house. My shoes got wet from some mud and I fell, and the frisbee went through the window.” “Then what happened?” “I went in and got the frisbee, but the noise must have startled the cat, Sarabelle. After I left the house, I heard the cage fall. That must have been how the canary escaped.” “Did you see the canary escape?” All three children shook their heads. No, they had not seen the canary escape. “Jimmy, is that your memory as well?” “Pretty much. I went into the house, too, to look for the frisbee, which I had thrown. But Alex had found it first. I didn’t notice anything about the birdcage. Sorry.” “How about you, Lydia?” “I was thirsty, so I just took a drink from my cup over there while those two were getting the frisbee back.” She pointed to a picnic table and chairs near the house. “So then, you had a clear view of the house all the time?” “Yes. Say, this is fun!” “And you are sure that you didn’t see the canary fly out the window?” “Yes.” “Okay. Let’s go back into the house, very quietly. We’ll see who can find the canary! And then, I’ll tell you who is fibbing, and what really happened!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Scene examination  \n   • The cage is on the floor, its little door open, the window beside it also open.  \n   • Near the French doors that open to the garden there are a few muddy shoe-prints “facing inwards” and some blades of grass.  \n   • No muddy prints point the other way, so whoever made them entered by the French doors but did not leave by the French doors.  \n   • The only person wearing shoes (and therefore able to leave muddy shoe prints) among the three children is Alex; Jimmy is barefoot; Lydia never left the lawn.  \n   • Old Sarabelle, the arthritic cat, is discovered asleep across the room; she has plainly been dozing for some time.  \n\n2. Statements compared with the physical facts  \n   • Alex says the Frisbee crashed through the window, that he climbed in through the window, picked it up, and then “after I left the house I heard the cage fall.”  \n   • If he had climbed in through the window his entry prints would point toward the window, not toward the French doors, and there would also be prints showing him climbing back out the window.  \n   • The only prints present are inward-facing prints beside the French doors. Alex therefore entered through the doors, not the window, and his entire story about the order of events is false.  \n   • Because the muddy prints show no outward track through the doors, Alex must have left by some other exit – the open window – exactly the reverse of what he claimed.  \n   • Thus Alex was in the room at the moment the cage toppled; the “after I left I heard the crash” part of the tale cannot be true.  \n\n3. What really happened  \n   • Jimmy’s high throw sent the Frisbee toward the house.  \n   • Alex sprinted after it, slipped in the mud, reached the French doors first, yanked them open and ran inside to grab the disc.  \n   • In his haste he brushed the canary table, knocking the cage to the floor; the impact sprang the latch.  \n   • Startled, Rufus fluttered out of the cage and, with the window already open for air, flew deeper into the house (or is still hiding in the music room’s curtains).  \n   • Panicking, Alex climbed out the open window (leaving no muddy prints pointing outward at the doors) and invented the story about the window to keep himself from “getting into trouble.” Jimmy and Lydia, not wishing to be “snitches,” agreed to go along with him.  \n\n4. Motive & responsibility  \n   • No one planned harm to Rufus; nevertheless Alex’s reckless dash for the Frisbee caused the accident.  \n   • The contradictory footprint evidence shows he alone had the opportunity and that he lied about it; no one else’s account conflicts with the facts on the floor.  \n\nTherefore the person responsible for the cage’s fall – and therefore for Rufus’s escape – is Alex Johnston.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAlex Johnston, Jimmy Carstairs, Lydia Carstairs, Sarabelle the cat, Marjorie the maid, James Carstairs, Mrs. Carstairs\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nAlex Johnston\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly before Crusher Davis arrived, the three youngsters were tossing a Frisbee on the lawn.  \n1. Jimmy’s throw sailed over Lydia toward the house.  \n2. Alex sprinted after it, slipped in a muddy spot, and, instead of stooping to pick the disc up outside, burst through the French doors into the music-room.  \n3. His wet, grassy shoes left inward-facing prints by the doorway.  \n4. In his rush he struck the table that held Rufus’s cage; the cage toppled, hit the floor, the latch sprang and the door flew open.  \n5. Rufus, set free, fluttered out; the old cat merely blinked and went back to sleep.  \n6. Realising the trouble he was in, Alex scrambled out through the already-open window – avoiding leaving outward prints at the doors – and made up a tale that the Frisbee had broken the window and that he had entered and left by the window before the cage fell.  \n7. Jimmy and Lydia, unwilling to “snitch,” decided to back up his story.  \n8. Rufus is very likely still somewhere in the house (perhaps perched on a curtain rail) and can be coaxed down once everyone quiets down.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Jimmy Carstairs – Played barefoot; the prints are from shoes. His only “crime” was a high throw.  \n• Lydia Carstairs – Never went into the room; no muddy prints match her sandals.  \n• Sarabelle the cat – Too arthritic and was found fast asleep; no scratch marks on the cage and no feathers around her.  \n• Marjorie the maid – Had left the room an hour earlier when cage and bird were still fine.  \n• Mr. & Mrs. Carstairs – Were elsewhere (he greeting Crusher, she upstairs distressed) and had neither reason nor opportunity.  \nOnly Alex’s movements, footprints and false account fit every physical fact, so the blame rests with him alone.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "answer_options": "(a) Alex Johnston; (b) Jimmy Carstairs; (c) Lydia Carstairs; (d) Sarabelle",
    "correct_answer": "(a) Alex Johnston",
    "reveal_text": "Lydia never had the frisbee, so could not have thrown it through the window. Given the absence of her footprints, neither did she enter the house. Either Jimmy, who was playing barefoot, or Alex, may have thrown the frisbee through the window by accident. We have proof, however, that Alex entered the music room through the French doors because he was wearing shoes, and there were muddy footprints by the door. Since Alex went into the house first, he was probably closer to the house than Jimmy.\nIt seems unlikely that a thrown frisbee could knock over a metal birdcage. It is however possible that in retrieving the frisbee near the cage, Alex accidentally knocked the cage over. He then made up the story about the cat, Sarabelle, whose arthritis and advanced age makes her an unlikely suspect. Alex would have had no motive to invent this improbable story if he had not knocked the cage over himself.\nNobody saw the canary fly out of the open window, and Lydia had a clear view and would have seen the bird. A close look through the music room showed the canary hiding at the far end of the room, behind a curtain. The rediscovery of Rufus the canary wouldn’t make any crime stopper headlines, but it put Mrs. Carstairs in a happy frame of mind, to serve an excellent dinner to her guests.",

      "answer_options": "(a) Alex Johnston; (b) Jimmy Carstairs; (c) Lydia Carstairs; (d) Sarabelle",
      "answer": "(a) Alex Johnston",
      "outcome": "Lydia never had the frisbee, so could not have thrown it through the window. Given the absence of her footprints, neither did she enter the house. Either Jimmy, who was playing barefoot, or Alex, may have thrown the frisbee through the window by accident. We have proof, however, that Alex entered the music room through the French doors because he was wearing shoes, and there were muddy footprints by the door. Since Alex went into the house first, he was probably closer to the house than Jimmy.\nIt seems unlikely that a thrown frisbee could knock over a metal birdcage. It is however possible that in retrieving the frisbee near the cage, Alex accidentally knocked the cage over. He then made up the story about the cat, Sarabelle, whose arthritis and advanced age makes her an unlikely suspect. Alex would have had no motive to invent this improbable story if he had not knocked the cage over himself.\nNobody saw the canary fly out of the open window, and Lydia had a clear view and would have seen the bird. A close look through the music room showed the canary hiding at the far end of the room, behind a curtain. The rediscovery of Rufus the canary wouldn’t make any crime stopper headlines, but it put Mrs. Carstairs in a happy frame of mind, to serve an excellent dinner to her guests."
