    "full_text": "Disorder wasn’t the word for it. When I arrived at the Carstairs residence for a long anticipated dinner, my hostess was distraught. She was upstairs, and her husband, James Carstairs, greeted me, an alarmed expression on his face. “It’s her favorite canary,” he said. “Or rather, it was her favorite canary, a real chirpy one. Rufus was his name. Don’t ask me why.” He led me into the music room, which looked out onto the garden. A metal canary cage had been knocked off its table and lay on its side on the floor. The little door was opened, the latch sprung. There was no trace of the canary. An open window gave the obvious answer. Somehow, the canary cage had been knocked off its perch and fallen to the floor, breaking the latch and opening the cage door. Mr. Carstairs leaned forward and said that his wife had gone upstairs as soon as she had entered the music room to arrange the flowers and discovered the missing canary, some twenty minutes earlier. I was early to dinner, hoping to talk about my columns for the Chronicle. Oh yes, I should have mentioned that Mr. Carstairs is my boss at the newspaper, which he owns and also runs as Managing Editor. The newspaper had had rather a good year, unlike most newspapers, and this dinner party was to have been a celebration. The other guests would be arriving in half an hour, and the cook was putting the finishing touches on the dinner that we would soon be enjoying, if this canary disappearance could be sorted out, Mr. Carstairs said. “Maybe this could be one of your mysteries. You know, interview people, do what you have to do. Just like Martha would do.” He was referring to the advice column that I wrote for the Chronicle, under the Ask Martha byline. It was a more credible byline than Crusher Davis, my real nickname, and the one I used for reporting sports news. Crusher probably went better with my six foot six frame and two-hundred-sixty-five pounds. Anyway, the real Ask Martha identity was a well-kept secret with just Carstairs, Inspector Samuels of the local police and the newspaper secretary in the know. “That means interviewing your own family, Mr. Carstairs.” “So be it. I hate cold dinners. And I really hate having no dinner at all!” “Who was in this room, or near it, when the cage fell?” “We do know that. The maid, Marjorie, was here an hour ago. She reported that everything was normal. The children, Jimmy and Lydia, were playing outside with the neighbor’s boy, Alex Johnston. They’re still outside.” I looked around the room carefully. There were a few mud stains by the French doors facing inwards, which traced the outline of a shoe, and here and there were a few strands of grass. My attention was attracted by a squeaky yawn, and over against the far wall, a large orange cat sleepily shook herself awake. “And, of course, Sarabelle was here too,” said Mr. Carstairs. “She’s seventeen now, has a touch of arthritis and spends most of her time asleep, when she isn’t eating. Now I’ll go and see how my wife is doing.” I opened the French doors to the garden, and saw the three children playing frisbee, right outside the house. They were in Middle School, what used to be called Junior High, I’d say. Jimmy and Alex were trying to keep the frisbee away from Lydia, who was between them, jumping for the frisbee whenever they would toss it, just over her head. “No fair,” cried an exasperated Lydia, “you two meanies haven’t let me catch the frisbee even once. This isn’t any fun at all!” Jimmy, who was playing barefoot, saw me first. “Hi, Crusher! Want to join us?” “Thanks, Jimmy. I’m on a case. Actually, you can all help.” They all looked sheepishly at each other. “Snitching isn’t right,” said Jimmy. “That’s true. But if it’s a game, it will be all right. If I tell you what happened, you can tell me if I got it right, can’t you?” They thought this over. “Is it okay if we don’t exactly tell you what happened?” “Sure. Why not? That happens all the time in my real cases, anyway.” The children huddled together, made plans and laughed. Alex had a question. “But what happens if none of us did it?” “Did what, Alex?” They all turned red. “Okay, Crusher, you’ve got us there.” “Yes. Well, the canary is missing. The cage was knocked off its perch. It fell, and the door latch came undone. The canary, Rufus, flew away. That’s all pretty clear. How did it happen, that’s what I want to know.” Alex finally answered. “Well, I was running to catch a frisbee toss over by the house. My shoes got wet from some mud and I fell, and the frisbee went through the window.” “Then what happened?” “I went in and got the frisbee, but the noise must have startled the cat, Sarabelle. After I left the house, I heard the cage fall. That must have been how the canary escaped.” “Did you see the canary escape?” All three children shook their heads. No, they had not seen the canary escape. “Jimmy, is that your memory as well?” “Pretty much. I went into the house, too, to look for the frisbee, which I had thrown. But Alex had found it first. I didn’t notice anything about the birdcage. Sorry.” “How about you, Lydia?” “I was thirsty, so I just took a drink from my cup over there while those two were getting the frisbee back.” She pointed to a picnic table and chairs near the house. “So then, you had a clear view of the house all the time?” “Yes. Say, this is fun!” “And you are sure that you didn’t see the canary fly out the window?” “Yes.” “Okay. Let’s go back into the house, very quietly. We’ll see who can find the canary! And then, I’ll tell you who is fibbing, and what really happened!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could have been in the music-room after the maid left it in perfect order?\n •  Only someone who had been out in the garden – the muddy shoe-prints that point INTO the room prove that.  \n •  Of all the people mentioned, the only one who was wearing shoes in the garden was Alex; Jimmy was barefoot and Lydia never went in at all.\n\n2. What really happened to the canary?\n •  Lydia, sitting at the picnic table, says she had the French windows in full view and never saw a yellow bird shoot out of them.  \n •  A bright yellow canary fluttering past her would have been impossible to miss, so the bird must still be inside the house.  \n •  That means the open window was only a red-herring to make the grown-ups think the bird had escaped.\n\n3. How was the cage knocked down?  \n •  The 17-year-old arthritic cat is hardly agile enough to jump up, push a heavy metal cage off a table and then curl up to sleep again without leaving tufts of fur or feathers.  \n •  A frisbee travelling at speed, however, could easily send a light cage tumbling – and Jimmy admits he threw the frisbee that sailed toward the house.\n\n4. Who is lying?  \n •  Jimmy says he “went into the house, too,” yet there is not a single bare foot-print or smear that could have been made by him – only a set of shoe-prints.  \n •  Therefore Jimmy never went inside; he added himself to the story only to spread the blame.  \n •  Alex’s tale about hearing the cage fall AFTER he left is also false; had that been so there would have been outward-facing prints as well as inward ones.  The prints show only entry, so he was inside when the cage came down.\n\n5. Motive?  Nothing sinister – just three children desperate not to have a celebration dinner spoiled and themselves blamed.  So they improvised a story that shifted the responsibility to a startled cat and an obligingly open window.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAlex Johnston, Jimmy Carstairs, Lydia Carstairs, Sarabelle the cat, Marjorie the maid, Mrs Carstairs, Mr Carstairs\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJimmy Carstairs\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nAlex Johnston\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nJimmy, playing barefoot, hurled the frisbee a little too enthusiastically.  \nThe disc flew in through the already opened music-room window and smashed into the small canary cage, sending it clattering to the floor and springing the latch. Rufus fluttered out, but instead of streaking through the window he panicked and found a hiding place up among the curtains or on the picture-rail.\n\nRealising what had happened, Jimmy begged his friend Alex for help.  Alex, whose shoes were caked with mud from his fall, ran through the French doors (leaving the inward-facing prints and the blades of grass), collected the frisbee and tried, unsuccessfully, to get the cage upright and locate the bird.  Hearing Mrs Carstairs’s footsteps elsewhere in the house, he hurried back outside – probably by climbing back out of the still-open window, which is why no outward-pointing prints exist.\n\nThe boys hastily agreed on a story:  the frisbee had gone in, Alex had retrieved it, and the NOISE had frightened the cat, which had then toppled the cage, letting the canary escape through the window.  Lydia, who had seen only the frisbee incident, accepted the tale and contributed the “I never saw the bird fly out” part, hoping it would not matter.\n\nTwenty minutes later the adults discovered the overturned cage; Rufus simply stayed quiet in his hiding-place until the detective suggested a silent search that would shortly reveal him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Alex Johnston’s only offence was helping his friend cover up the accident; the single line of shoe-prints shows he entered but his story about the timing of the crash is false, making him an accomplice rather than the prime mover.  \n•  Lydia Carstairs never left the garden and had no opportunity to touch the cage.  \n•  Sarabelle the cat is old, arthritic and asleep; there is no physical evidence (feathers, scratches, fur on the cage) to suggest she moved it.  \n•  Marjorie the maid was in the room an hour earlier when everything was normal, and she had no reason to stage a disappearance just before a dinner she had spent the afternoon preparing.  \n•  Mr and Mrs Carstairs were busy greeting guests and arranging flowers; neither had any motive to wreck their own celebration.  \nHence only Jimmy, aided by Alex, had the necessary opportunity and acted upon it.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "correct_answer": "(a) Alex Johnston",
    "reveal_text": "Lydia never had the frisbee, so could not have thrown it through the window. Given the absence of her footprints, neither did she enter the house. Either Jimmy, who was playing barefoot, or Alex, may have thrown the frisbee through the window by accident. We have proof, however, that Alex entered the music room through the French doors because he was wearing shoes, and there were muddy footprints by the door. Since Alex went into the house first, he was probably closer to the house than Jimmy.\nIt seems unlikely that a thrown frisbee could knock over a metal birdcage. It is however possible that in retrieving the frisbee near the cage, Alex accidentally knocked the cage over. He then made up the story about the cat, Sarabelle, whose arthritis and advanced age makes her an unlikely suspect. Alex would have had no motive to invent this improbable story if he had not knocked the cage over himself.\nNobody saw the canary fly out of the open window, and Lydia had a clear view and would have seen the bird. A close look through the music room showed the canary hiding at the far end of the room, behind a curtain. The rediscovery of Rufus the canary wouldn’t make any crime stopper headlines, but it put Mrs. Carstairs in a happy frame of mind, to serve an excellent dinner to her guests.",

      "answer": "(a) Alex Johnston",
      "outcome": "Lydia never had the frisbee, so could not have thrown it through the window. Given the absence of her footprints, neither did she enter the house. Either Jimmy, who was playing barefoot, or Alex, may have thrown the frisbee through the window by accident. We have proof, however, that Alex entered the music room through the French doors because he was wearing shoes, and there were muddy footprints by the door. Since Alex went into the house first, he was probably closer to the house than Jimmy.\nIt seems unlikely that a thrown frisbee could knock over a metal birdcage. It is however possible that in retrieving the frisbee near the cage, Alex accidentally knocked the cage over. He then made up the story about the cat, Sarabelle, whose arthritis and advanced age makes her an unlikely suspect. Alex would have had no motive to invent this improbable story if he had not knocked the cage over himself.\nNobody saw the canary fly out of the open window, and Lydia had a clear view and would have seen the bird. A close look through the music room showed the canary hiding at the far end of the room, behind a curtain. The rediscovery of Rufus the canary wouldn’t make any crime stopper headlines, but it put Mrs. Carstairs in a happy frame of mind, to serve an excellent dinner to her guests."
