    "full_text": "I was helping to clean up after the school play, “How the Scarecrow Got His Heart.” Mrs. Tillman wrote the play herself and this was the seventh year in a row that the sixth grade had put it on. Tonight's show got a standing ovation and everyone was in a good mood. \"Did you see all those people clapping?\" Eric said, as he swept up the straw that was scattered over the stage. \"I love it! I'm going to be an actor when I grow uh...uh...ah CHOO!\" \"What's wrong, Eric?\" Jenny Jackson asked. \"Is your straw allergy acting up?\" It was true. The lead actor in “How the Scarecrow Got His Heart” was allergic to straw. He broke out in a horrible, itchy rash after the first rehearsal and we had to stuff his costume with paper strips instead of straw. \"No,\" Eric said. \"I only get an allergic reaction when I touch straw.\" \"He's just allergic to work,\" said Jimmy. He was Jenny's twin brother. \"Give him a break,\" Wendy LaRue said as she struggled to move one of the big scarecrow props. \"Learning all the lines isn't exactly easy, either.\" \"I guess not,\" Jimmy said. \"It's good of you to help, Eric. I would've gone to the party with the rest of the cast if I was you.\" \"I guess I just want to spend a little more time here on stage,\" Eric said. \"Being part of the play was so much fun. I'm going to miss it.\" \"I'll miss it, too,\" Wendy said. \"But right now, I've got to go. I'm supposed to be at dinner with my parents in twenty minutes.\" We all told her to go and wished her a good time. Even with just four of us, it took almost another hour to finish storing away all the backdrops. The real work was dragging the two man-sized, straw-stuffed scarecrows out to the dumpsters. After that was done, the other three students headed home and I stayed to sweep up the stage one last time. I was about to go myself when I noticed that the big smile had disappeared from our teacher's face. \"What's wrong, Mrs. Tillman?\" I asked. \"I can't seem to find the scarecrow's heart,\" she said. She was talking about the central prop for the play. It was a cardboard heart about as big as my chest, all covered with gold foil and plastic beads. \"That's too bad,\" I said. \"But you can always make a new one, right?\" \"Yes,\" Mrs. Tillman replied. \"But this one was very special to me. I made it for the very first production and I've used it every year since. It has a lot of memories attached.\" \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Tillman,\" I said. \"Is anything else missing?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Just the heart.\" \"Well, I really am sorry it's lost,\" I said. \"It's not your fault,\" Mrs. Tillman assured me. \"You didn't take it.\" Those words got me thinking. That night in bed, my mind kept replaying that evening over and over. It was so unlikely that only one prop, which was awfully big and hard to miss, would go missing. Someone must have stolen it. But why, and how? It would have been quite a trick to sneak that thing out of the room without anyone noticing. Before I finally fell asleep, I promised myself that I would get to the bottom of the mystery the very next day. The next day was unusually warm. I wore a pair of shorts and a T-shirt to school for the first time all spring. The nice weather put me in a good mood and I was optimistic about solving the mystery of the scarecrow's heart. I caught up with the twins just before the first bell. I didn't have time to beat around the bush. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. \"Do you really think so?\" Jenny asked. \"I do,\" I said. \"Mrs. Tillman said that the heart was the only thing that was missing. It was too big and shiny to get lost.\" \"Shiny?\" Jimmy asked. \"That prop was ugly.\" \"Yeah,\" Jenny added. \"Why would anyone want to steal that gaudy thing?\" The bell rang and we all had to hurry to our first class. As I made my way through the halls, I thought about what the twins said. Why would anyone steal that heart? I didn't see Eric until lunchtime. He was sitting alone at a table in the corner and was already done with his food before I joined him. \"You must be cold-blooded,\" I said as I sat down. \"Why do you say that?\" he asked. \"Because you're about the only kid I've seen today wearing a long-sleeved shirt.\" Eric looked down at his shirt and nodded. \"I've been hearing that all day,\" he said. I leaned in close to him and whispered because I didn't want the whole cafeteria to hear me. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. Eric's eyes grew wide and he whispered back, \"Do you really think so?\" I wondered how many people were going to ask me that. I went through the same explanation I gave the twins. \"I see what you mean,\" Eric said. \"Do you think she's really upset about it?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"She was really proud of how that heart has been part of the play all seven years that she's done it.\" \"Well, maybe it will turn up after all,\" Eric said. Then he scratched his arm and stood up, saying, \"I've got some homework and stuff that I need to get done. I'll see you later.\" I said, \"Sure thing,\" and he headed off to empty his tray. Eric prided himself on getting all of his homework done at school. I don't think he ever took any of it home. Wendy sat down just then. \"Where is Eric going?\" she asked. \"To do homework,\" I answered. \"That figures.\" Wendy started eating. Just like with the twins and Eric, I came right out and said that I thought someone had stolen the heart. Her eyes flicked up from her burrito and she asked, \"Do you really think so?\" I should have known she'd ask that. I held in a groan and said that I did think so and explained why. She put her fork down and looked me straight in the eye. \"Do you think I stole it?\" she asked. \"I hope not,\" I said. \"Well, I didn't.\" Her eyes dropped back down to her food and she picked up her fork again. \"Do you think someone else might have done it?\" I asked. \"Maybe you,\" she said, without looking up. I decided that she was too angry to be of much help. We finished our meals in silence. As soon as I was done, I emptied my tray in the trash and looked for the twins. I found them in the library. \"Hi guys,\" I said. \"Hi,\" they both answered at once. \"How's it going?\" Jenny asked. \"Did you figure out who stole the heart?\" Jimmy said. \"Not yet,\" I said, \"but I think I'm close. I just have one more question for you two.\" \"Okay,\" Jimmy said, and Jenny added, \"Shoot.\" \"When was the last time you saw the heart?\" \"I saw it when we were cleaning up all the other props,\" Jimmy said. Jenny thought for a moment and added, \"It was probably about fifteen minutes before we left.\" I nodded and said, \"Thanks. That was just what I wanted to hear.\" I knew who did it and there were still five more minutes left in lunch period.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could have wanted the heart?\n   • Eric was the only one who talked about how much he was going to “miss the play” and how he “just wanted to spend a little more time on stage.”  That sounds exactly like someone who would like a souvenir.\n   • No one else ever said anything that suggested a sentimental attachment to the prop.\n\n2. Could Wendy have taken it when she left early?\n   • She left more than an hour before the others finished.\n   • Both twins told me they still saw the heart about fifteen minutes before they (and Eric) went home.  \n     If they could still see it, it was obviously still on the stage after Wendy was long gone.  \n     Therefore Wendy cannot have taken it.\n\n3. What happened in the last fifteen-minute window?\n   • The only job left was hauling the two life-size, straw-stuffed scarecrows to the dumpster.\n   • The heart was “as big as my chest” and shiny; nobody could walk out carrying that without\n     being seen.  \n   • But if someone stuffed it inside one of the straw scarecrows, it would be invisible and could\n     be rolled out to the dumpster right under everyone’s nose.\n\n4. Who would be willing to handle straw long enough to hide the heart?\n   • Eric is violently allergic to straw – he “only gets an allergic reaction when he touches straw.”\n   • The very next (hot) day he is the only student wearing a long-sleeved shirt, and he keeps\n     scratching his arm.  The sleeves hide the rash his allergy would have produced the night\n     before while he was pushing straw aside to hide the heart.\n\n5. Motive + opportunity + physical evidence line up for only one person – Eric.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEric (last name not given), Wendy LaRue, Jenny Jackson, Jimmy Jackson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nEric\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring the final clean-up the heart was still lying on the stage after the backdrops had been put away.  \nWhen the time came to drag the two man-size scarecrows to the dumpster, Eric waited until the others were busy, opened a seam in one of the straw bodies, shoved the gold-foiled heart deep inside, and quickly re-tied the twine.  \nBecause he had to push his bare hands and arms into the straw he broke out in his usual rash, but he hid that by wearing a long-sleeved shirt the next (very warm) day.  \nWith the heart safely hidden, all four students rolled the scarecrows outside and tossed them into the dumpster, none of them noticing the extra cargo.  \nEric intended to come back later (that night or early the next morning) and fish the heart out of the dumpster as soon as the coast was clear.  \nMrs. Tillman missed the heart only after everyone but the narrator had gone, so no one thought to look in the trash.  \nEric’s strange clothing choice the following hot day, plus the twins’ statement that the heart was still present well after Wendy had left, pointed straight to him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Wendy LaRue – She was gone more than an hour before the heart disappeared.  \n  The twins’ statement proves the heart was still on stage long after she left.\n\n• Jenny and Jimmy Jackson – They were the ones who saw the heart fifteen minutes before they went home.  \n  From that moment until the teacher discovered it missing, they were never alone with the prop; they left the building together with Eric and could not have removed it unnoticed.\n\n• Mrs. Tillman and the narrator – Mrs. Tillman was the victim, and the narrator was still sweeping the stage when she discovered the loss; neither had any reason or practical way to “steal” the prop.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It has a lot of memories attached.\" \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Tillman,\" I said. \"Is anything else missing?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Just the heart.\" \"Well, I really am sorry it's lost,\" I said. \"It's not your fault,\" Mrs. Tillman assured me. \"You didn't take it.\" Those words got me thinking. That night in bed, my mind kept replaying that evening over and over. It was so unlikely that only one prop, which was awfully big and hard to miss, would go missing. Someone must have stolen it. But why, and how? It would have been quite a trick to sneak that thing out of the room without anyone noticing. Before I finally fell asleep, I promised myself that I would get to the bottom of the mystery the very next day. The next day was unusually warm. I wore a pair of shorts and a T-shirt to school for the first time all spring. The nice weather put me in a good mood and I was optimistic about solving the mystery of the scarecrow's heart. I caught up with the twins just before the first bell. I didn't have time to beat around the bush. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. \"Do you really think so?\" Jenny asked. \"I do,\" I said. \"Mrs. Tillman said that the heart was the only thing that was missing. It was too big and shiny to get lost.\" \"Shiny?\" Jimmy asked. \"That prop was ugly.\" \"Yeah,\" Jenny added. \"Why would anyone want to steal that gaudy thing?\" The bell rang and we all had to hurry to our first class. As I made my way through the halls, I thought about what the twins said. Why would anyone steal that heart? I didn't see Eric until lunchtime. He was sitting alone at a table in the corner and was already done with his food before I joined him. \"You must be cold-blooded,\" I said as I sat down. \"Why do you say that?\" he asked. \"Because you're about the only kid I've seen today wearing a long-sleeved shirt.\" Eric looked down at his shirt and nodded. \"I've been hearing that all day,\" he said. I leaned in close to him and whispered because I didn't want the whole cafeteria to hear me. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. Eric's eyes grew wide and he whispered back, \"Do you really think so?\" I wondered how many people were going to ask me that. I went through the same explanation I gave the twins. \"I see what you mean,\" Eric said. \"Do you think she's really upset about it?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"She was really proud of how that heart has been part of the play all seven years that she's done it.\" \"Well, maybe it will turn up after all,\" Eric said. Then he scratched his arm and stood up, saying, \"I've got some homework and stuff that I need to get done. I'll see you later.\" I said, \"Sure thing,\" and he headed off to empty his tray. Eric prided himself on getting all of his homework done at school. I don't think he ever took any of it home. Wendy sat down just then. \"Where is Eric going?\" she asked. \"To do homework,\" I answered. \"That figures.\" Wendy started eating. Just like with the twins and Eric, I came right out and said that I thought someone had stolen the heart. Her eyes flicked up from her burrito and she asked, \"Do you really think so?\" I should have known she'd ask that. I held in a groan and said that I did think so and explained why. She put her fork down and looked me straight in the eye. \"Do you think I stole it?\" she asked. \"I hope not,\" I said. \"Well, I didn't.\" Her eyes dropped back down to her food and she picked up her fork again. \"Do you think someone else might have done it?\" I asked. \"Maybe you,\" she said, without looking up. I decided that she was too angry to be of much help. We finished our meals in silence. As soon as I was done, I emptied my tray in the trash and looked for the twins. I found them in the library. \"Hi guys,\" I said. \"Hi,\" they both answered at once. \"How's it going?\" Jenny asked. \"Did you figure out who stole the heart?\" Jimmy said. \"Not yet,\" I said, \"but I think I'm close. I just have one more question for you two.\" \"Okay,\" Jimmy said, and Jenny added, \"Shoot.\" \"When was the last time you saw the heart?\" \"I saw it when we were cleaning up all the other props,\" Jimmy said. Jenny thought for a moment and added, \"It was probably about fifteen minutes before we left.\" I nodded and said, \"Thanks. That was just what I wanted to hear.\" I knew who did it and there were still five more minutes left in lunch period.",

      "outcome": "“Eric, you’ve got to return that heart to Mrs. Tillman,” I said, when I found him at his locker.\n“Why do you think I took it?” he asked, annoyed.\n“Well, Jimmy thinks the heart is ugly, and Jenny thinks it’s gaudy. So they didn’t take it. Wendy was out to dinner with her parents when it was taken, so it wasn’t her. That leaves you, and I noticed you wore long sleeves today and were scratching your arms, which means you’ve been contact with straw.\n“You hid the heart inside one of the scarecrows before they were taken out to the dumpsters. Then you came back later and dug it out. Right?”\n“Yes,” Eric said sheepishly. “I wanted it as a keepsake of the play. I… I’ll return it to Mrs. Tillman before I go home today.”"
