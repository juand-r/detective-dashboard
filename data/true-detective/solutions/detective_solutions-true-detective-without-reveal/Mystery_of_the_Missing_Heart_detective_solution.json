    "full_text": "I was helping to clean up after the school play, “How the Scarecrow Got His Heart.” Mrs. Tillman wrote the play herself and this was the seventh year in a row that the sixth grade had put it on. Tonight's show got a standing ovation and everyone was in a good mood. \"Did you see all those people clapping?\" Eric said, as he swept up the straw that was scattered over the stage. \"I love it! I'm going to be an actor when I grow uh...uh...ah CHOO!\" \"What's wrong, Eric?\" Jenny Jackson asked. \"Is your straw allergy acting up?\" It was true. The lead actor in “How the Scarecrow Got His Heart” was allergic to straw. He broke out in a horrible, itchy rash after the first rehearsal and we had to stuff his costume with paper strips instead of straw. \"No,\" Eric said. \"I only get an allergic reaction when I touch straw.\" \"He's just allergic to work,\" said Jimmy. He was Jenny's twin brother. \"Give him a break,\" Wendy LaRue said as she struggled to move one of the big scarecrow props. \"Learning all the lines isn't exactly easy, either.\" \"I guess not,\" Jimmy said. \"It's good of you to help, Eric. I would've gone to the party with the rest of the cast if I was you.\" \"I guess I just want to spend a little more time here on stage,\" Eric said. \"Being part of the play was so much fun. I'm going to miss it.\" \"I'll miss it, too,\" Wendy said. \"But right now, I've got to go. I'm supposed to be at dinner with my parents in twenty minutes.\" We all told her to go and wished her a good time. Even with just four of us, it took almost another hour to finish storing away all the backdrops. The real work was dragging the two man-sized, straw-stuffed scarecrows out to the dumpsters. After that was done, the other three students headed home and I stayed to sweep up the stage one last time. I was about to go myself when I noticed that the big smile had disappeared from our teacher's face. \"What's wrong, Mrs. Tillman?\" I asked. \"I can't seem to find the scarecrow's heart,\" she said. She was talking about the central prop for the play. It was a cardboard heart about as big as my chest, all covered with gold foil and plastic beads. \"That's too bad,\" I said. \"But you can always make a new one, right?\" \"Yes,\" Mrs. Tillman replied. \"But this one was very special to me. I made it for the very first production and I've used it every year since. It has a lot of memories attached.\" \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Tillman,\" I said. \"Is anything else missing?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Just the heart.\" \"Well, I really am sorry it's lost,\" I said. \"It's not your fault,\" Mrs. Tillman assured me. \"You didn't take it.\" Those words got me thinking. That night in bed, my mind kept replaying that evening over and over. It was so unlikely that only one prop, which was awfully big and hard to miss, would go missing. Someone must have stolen it. But why, and how? It would have been quite a trick to sneak that thing out of the room without anyone noticing. Before I finally fell asleep, I promised myself that I would get to the bottom of the mystery the very next day. The next day was unusually warm. I wore a pair of shorts and a T-shirt to school for the first time all spring. The nice weather put me in a good mood and I was optimistic about solving the mystery of the scarecrow's heart. I caught up with the twins just before the first bell. I didn't have time to beat around the bush. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. \"Do you really think so?\" Jenny asked. \"I do,\" I said. \"Mrs. Tillman said that the heart was the only thing that was missing. It was too big and shiny to get lost.\" \"Shiny?\" Jimmy asked. \"That prop was ugly.\" \"Yeah,\" Jenny added. \"Why would anyone want to steal that gaudy thing?\" The bell rang and we all had to hurry to our first class. As I made my way through the halls, I thought about what the twins said. Why would anyone steal that heart? I didn't see Eric until lunchtime. He was sitting alone at a table in the corner and was already done with his food before I joined him. \"You must be cold-blooded,\" I said as I sat down. \"Why do you say that?\" he asked. \"Because you're about the only kid I've seen today wearing a long-sleeved shirt.\" Eric looked down at his shirt and nodded. \"I've been hearing that all day,\" he said. I leaned in close to him and whispered because I didn't want the whole cafeteria to hear me. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. Eric's eyes grew wide and he whispered back, \"Do you really think so?\" I wondered how many people were going to ask me that. I went through the same explanation I gave the twins. \"I see what you mean,\" Eric said. \"Do you think she's really upset about it?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"She was really proud of how that heart has been part of the play all seven years that she's done it.\" \"Well, maybe it will turn up after all,\" Eric said. Then he scratched his arm and stood up, saying, \"I've got some homework and stuff that I need to get done. I'll see you later.\" I said, \"Sure thing,\" and he headed off to empty his tray. Eric prided himself on getting all of his homework done at school. I don't think he ever took any of it home. Wendy sat down just then. \"Where is Eric going?\" she asked. \"To do homework,\" I answered. \"That figures.\" Wendy started eating. Just like with the twins and Eric, I came right out and said that I thought someone had stolen the heart. Her eyes flicked up from her burrito and she asked, \"Do you really think so?\" I should have known she'd ask that. I held in a groan and said that I did think so and explained why. She put her fork down and looked me straight in the eye. \"Do you think I stole it?\" she asked. \"I hope not,\" I said. \"Well, I didn't.\" Her eyes dropped back down to her food and she picked up her fork again. \"Do you think someone else might have done it?\" I asked. \"Maybe you,\" she said, without looking up. I decided that she was too angry to be of much help. We finished our meals in silence. As soon as I was done, I emptied my tray in the trash and looked for the twins. I found them in the library. \"Hi guys,\" I said. \"Hi,\" they both answered at once. \"How's it going?\" Jenny asked. \"Did you figure out who stole the heart?\" Jimmy said. \"Not yet,\" I said, \"but I think I'm close. I just have one more question for you two.\" \"Okay,\" Jimmy said, and Jenny added, \"Shoot.\" \"When was the last time you saw the heart?\" \"I saw it when we were cleaning up all the other props,\" Jimmy said. Jenny thought for a moment and added, \"It was probably about fifteen minutes before we left.\" I nodded and said, \"Thanks. That was just what I wanted to hear.\" I knew who did it and there were still five more minutes left in lunch period.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Eric:  loved the play, said he “wanted to spend a little more time here on stage” and that he was “going to miss it.”  A big, glitter-covered heart would be the perfect souvenir for the boy who had played the Scarecrow for the last time in elementary school.  \n   • Jenny & Jimmy:  they both called the prop “ugly” and “gaudy.”  If anything, they seemed to dislike it.  No positive motive.  \n   • Wendy:  left early for dinner; nothing links her emotionally to the heart.  \n   • Narrator / Mrs. Tillman are out of the question.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   The only people still present after Wendy went home were Eric, the twins and the narrator.  \n   To get the huge, shiny heart out without being seen you would have to hide it.  The only obvious hiding place was inside one of the two straw-stuffed scarecrows that the group dragged out to the dumpster a few minutes before everybody (except the narrator) left.\n\n3. Physical evidence / behaviour  \n   • Eric is violently allergic to straw and can only break out in a rash if he actually touches it.  \n   • The next day was unusually hot yet Eric showed up in a long-sleeved shirt and kept scratching his arm.  That means he had been in contact with straw the night before – something he should have avoided at all costs, and something no one else had a medical reason to hide.  \n   • The twins handled the scarecrows too, but they have no straw allergy, so there would be no rash to conceal.\n\n4. Time line confirmed by the twins  \n   When the detective asked, “When was the last time you saw the heart?” Jimmy answered “while we were cleaning the other props,” and Jenny added, “about fifteen minutes before we left.”  \n   Those fifteen minutes cover only one activity: lugging the scarecrows outside.  So the theft had to take place during that job.  \n   Wendy was already gone, the narrator was busy sweeping the floor, and the twins were working together.  Eric, however, carried one scarecrow by himself for a short distance (he said he wanted “one last moment on the stage” and kept lingering with it).  That gave him both privacy and the chance to shove the cardboard heart down into the straw — touching straw with his bare hands and triggering the rash we saw the next day.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n   • Only someone with a straw allergy would have had any reason to hide new skin irritation under long sleeves on a hot day.  \n   • Only Eric both had that allergy and had the opportunity when the heart must have disappeared.  \n   Therefore Eric is the only person who fits every single fact.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEric (last name not given), Jenny Jackson, Jimmy Jackson, Wendy LaRue\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nEric\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter Wendy left for her dinner, Mrs. Tillman, the narrator, Eric and the Jackson twins finished stacking scenery.  \nThe glittering cardboard heart was still lying on the prop table.  \nWhen it came time to drag the two life-size scarecrows to the dumpster, Eric deliberately volunteered to handle one of them by himself for “one last moment on stage.”  Out of sight of the others for only a few seconds, he pried open the stitches in the back of the scarecrow, shoved the big heart deep into the straw stuffing, and closed the slit roughly.  In the process his hands and arms rubbed against straw, giving him the allergy rash.  \nThe scarecrows were dumped.  Because the heart was hidden inside, no one noticed its absence until after Eric, Jenny and Jimmy had gone home.  \nThe next warm morning Eric wore a long-sleeved shirt to hide the red rash the straw had given him.  His scratching at lunch betrayed the allergy reaction.  \nHe planned to return to the dumpster later, retrieve the heart and keep it as a memento of his triumphant starring role.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJenny & Jimmy Jackson – both disliked the prop, had no motive, and they positively saw the heart shortly before they left.  They have no straw allergy, so they had no reason to hide their arms the next day.  \nWendy LaRue – left the auditorium well before the last sighting of the heart; she simply was not present when the theft occurred.  \nMrs. Tillman and the narrator – the teacher lamented the loss, and the narrator stayed after everyone else, so neither had the chance to smuggle the heart past Mrs. Tillman’s eyes.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I'm supposed to be at dinner with my parents in twenty minutes.\" We all told her to go and wished her a good time. Even with just four of us, it took almost another hour to finish storing away all the backdrops. The real work was dragging the two man-sized, straw-stuffed scarecrows out to the dumpsters. After that was done, the other three students headed home and I stayed to sweep up the stage one last time. I was about to go myself when I noticed that the big smile had disappeared from our teacher's face. \"What's wrong, Mrs. Tillman?\" I asked. \"I can't seem to find the scarecrow's heart,\" she said. She was talking about the central prop for the play. It was a cardboard heart about as big as my chest, all covered with gold foil and plastic beads. \"That's too bad,\" I said. \"But you can always make a new one, right?\" \"Yes,\" Mrs. Tillman replied. \"But this one was very special to me. I made it for the very first production and I've used it every year since. It has a lot of memories attached.\" \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Tillman,\" I said. \"Is anything else missing?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Just the heart.\" \"Well, I really am sorry it's lost,\" I said. \"It's not your fault,\" Mrs. Tillman assured me. \"You didn't take it.\" Those words got me thinking. That night in bed, my mind kept replaying that evening over and over. It was so unlikely that only one prop, which was awfully big and hard to miss, would go missing. Someone must have stolen it. But why, and how? It would have been quite a trick to sneak that thing out of the room without anyone noticing. Before I finally fell asleep, I promised myself that I would get to the bottom of the mystery the very next day. The next day was unusually warm. I wore a pair of shorts and a T-shirt to school for the first time all spring. The nice weather put me in a good mood and I was optimistic about solving the mystery of the scarecrow's heart. I caught up with the twins just before the first bell. I didn't have time to beat around the bush. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. \"Do you really think so?\" Jenny asked. \"I do,\" I said. \"Mrs. Tillman said that the heart was the only thing that was missing. It was too big and shiny to get lost.\" \"Shiny?\" Jimmy asked. \"That prop was ugly.\" \"Yeah,\" Jenny added. \"Why would anyone want to steal that gaudy thing?\" The bell rang and we all had to hurry to our first class. As I made my way through the halls, I thought about what the twins said. Why would anyone steal that heart? I didn't see Eric until lunchtime. He was sitting alone at a table in the corner and was already done with his food before I joined him. \"You must be cold-blooded,\" I said as I sat down. \"Why do you say that?\" he asked. \"Because you're about the only kid I've seen today wearing a long-sleeved shirt.\" Eric looked down at his shirt and nodded. \"I've been hearing that all day,\" he said. I leaned in close to him and whispered because I didn't want the whole cafeteria to hear me. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. Eric's eyes grew wide and he whispered back, \"Do you really think so?\" I wondered how many people were going to ask me that. I went through the same explanation I gave the twins. \"I see what you mean,\" Eric said. \"Do you think she's really upset about it?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"She was really proud of how that heart has been part of the play all seven years that she's done it.\" \"Well, maybe it will turn up after all,\" Eric said. Then he scratched his arm and stood up, saying, \"I've got some homework and stuff that I need to get done. I'll see you later.\" I said, \"Sure thing,\" and he headed off to empty his tray. Eric prided himself on getting all of his homework done at school. I don't think he ever took any of it home. Wendy sat down just then. \"Where is Eric going?\" she asked. \"To do homework,\" I answered. \"That figures.\" Wendy started eating. Just like with the twins and Eric, I came right out and said that I thought someone had stolen the heart. Her eyes flicked up from her burrito and she asked, \"Do you really think so?\" I should have known she'd ask that. I held in a groan and said that I did think so and explained why. She put her fork down and looked me straight in the eye. \"Do you think I stole it?\" she asked. \"I hope not,\" I said. \"Well, I didn't.\" Her eyes dropped back down to her food and she picked up her fork again. \"Do you think someone else might have done it?\" I asked. \"Maybe you,\" she said, without looking up. I decided that she was too angry to be of much help. We finished our meals in silence. As soon as I was done, I emptied my tray in the trash and looked for the twins. I found them in the library. \"Hi guys,\" I said. \"Hi,\" they both answered at once. \"How's it going?\" Jenny asked. \"Did you figure out who stole the heart?\" Jimmy said. \"Not yet,\" I said, \"but I think I'm close. I just have one more question for you two.\" \"Okay,\" Jimmy said, and Jenny added, \"Shoot.\" \"When was the last time you saw the heart?\" \"I saw it when we were cleaning up all the other props,\" Jimmy said. Jenny thought for a moment and added, \"It was probably about fifteen minutes before we left.\" I nodded and said, \"Thanks. That was just what I wanted to hear.\" I knew who did it and there were still five more minutes left in lunch period.",

      "outcome": "“Eric, you’ve got to return that heart to Mrs. Tillman,” I said, when I found him at his locker.\n“Why do you think I took it?” he asked, annoyed.\n“Well, Jimmy thinks the heart is ugly, and Jenny thinks it’s gaudy. So they didn’t take it. Wendy was out to dinner with her parents when it was taken, so it wasn’t her. That leaves you, and I noticed you wore long sleeves today and were scratching your arms, which means you’ve been contact with straw.\n“You hid the heart inside one of the scarecrows before they were taken out to the dumpsters. Then you came back later and dug it out. Right?”\n“Yes,” Eric said sheepishly. “I wanted it as a keepsake of the play. I… I’ll return it to Mrs. Tillman before I go home today.”"
