    "full_text": "There was a crime, and I was worried. And I was always worried about an acrobat named Lorenzo. He was my father, and he'd exercised every day until his slender body was covered with muscles. He was stuck in the bottom row of the pyramid, the acrobat supporting the other gymnasts who stood on his shoulders. More acrobats stood on their shoulders, and more on theirs … and then a clown knocked them all down. Our circus high-wire star earned twice as much money as the acrobats. After two years of hard practice, my father still hadn't earned a spot on the high-wire team. He was stuck on the ground with the tumblers, performing each night in their routines without a break for three solid hours. Tonight I saw disappointment in his face as the spotlight focused high above him on a wire strung from the circus tent poles. And that's when the crime happened. That same night our circus had received an angry visit from the town's sheriff. \"Your freaks don't belong here,\" he'd said fiercely. Lorenzo had watched with shame and anger as the sheriff bellowed, \"Circus people steal. And you're creepy looking, too. Get out of our village now!\" \"We received this permit months ago,\" said our ringmaster with laughter and warmth. \"And an honorable man like yourself wouldn't want to disappoint your 3,000 neighbors sharing a friendly evening with our circus family.\" The sheriff demanded a look at the permit and a chance to inspect the facilities, insisting that each customer in this dangerous place meant more work for his department on a Sunday night. The ringmaster continued flattering the sheriff, knowing we couldn't afford to cancel the Sunday show. It was an almost magical tradition – each weekend no matter how much money the circus earned, exactly one-third of that amount came from the Sunday crowds. But now the tight-wire had broken, and one of our performers was falling towards the ground! It was a 100-foot drop, and the audience gasped, but Lorenzo and I felt even more frightened. The falling man was the “Great Marchelli\" -- the proudest member of our circus family. We watched as Marchelli leaned his falling body forward. Suddenly he grabbed his knees and somehow hurled his legs over his head, doing an erratic somersault in the air. As he tried to propel his body into the safety net, he fell and missed! But Marchelli, being great, quickly stretched his arm out, grabbing desperately for the net's edge as he fell. The net stretched tight, stopping Marchelli's fall, and as the net sprung back into position, Marchelli used its momentum to hurl himself up into another confident somersault. He landed gracefully in the net on one knee, his arms stretched proudly. Marchelli glowed with pride and even arrogance. He spent his childhood in the circus, never learning to read or write, so he took an extra pride in his great performing skills. It was the ringmaster who was most concerned. With the sheriff arguing that circus people were crooks, he'd wanted to look organized and in control. And because the ringmaster was afraid of heights himself, he was most proud of the circus high-wire act. He shouted praise to the audience about the Great Marchelli. He added that circus life was full of excitement and surprises, and its trained experts were ready for anything. Though, his excitement would disappear when he found out he had been robbed. When the crowds left for the night, Zelda, the fortune teller, removed her wig of wild dark hair, and put on a pair of glasses. Privately she was proud of her ability with math, and she wanted everyone to know they could rely on her numbers. \"Lorenzo needs to buy gifts for his family!\" said the ringmaster with a smile, walking with my father into her trailer. But during the circus's performance, the money had been stolen. \"And there's something even stranger,\" Zelda said honestly. \"They didn't steal all of it!\" The money was locked in metal boxes, and every day in her book Zelda recorded the amount in each box before handing them over to the ringmaster on Sunday nights. After she'd reviewed the figures in her mysterious black book, she'd reached her startling conclusion. \"They stole some of our money?\" the ringmaster asked, genuinely puzzled. \"But why?\" \"The thief left us a note,\" Zelda replied, pulling a folder piece of paper from one metal box, sitting empty on her desk. It read: I took what you owed me. Tonight the wire will snap. \"That's our money!\" shouted Lorenzo angrily, as the ringmaster eyed him with suspicion, \nrecalling Lorenzo's eagerness to join the high-wire act. \"It wasn't me,\" Lorenzo protested as we left. \"Maybe the Great Marchelli sabotaged his own act, determined to steal the spotlight one more time!\" I wondered if Marchelli had a plan that was even more wicked. Maybe he'd faked that spectacular fall, just to cast suspicion on my father. That would ensure that my father would never be promoted into his place. Zelda wailed that she'd guarded the money carefully. \"The money could only have been stolen after the circus started -- and even then I was only gone for minutes to get our permit for the sheriff.\" Did the sheriff ask you himself? \"No,\" she said hesitantly. \"The ringmaster sent me to retrieve it from his desk in the front wagon.\" Her eyes focused, deep in thought, as she tried to imagine what happened in that time. Had his worries over profitability forced him to \"steal\" some money to hide it from his employees? We opened her book of numbers: Friday: $3927 \nSaturday: $8073 \"I didn't even get to finish calculating the numbers for Sunday! Zelda wailed. Was there anyone who was owed money? \"No!\" Zelda exclaimed. \"Everyone is paid equally, and always at the end of the week!\" she sighed. \"The ringmaster insists that each one of us be treated the same – except Marchelli, who gets a double share. There are 99 of us, and Marchelli's extra share makes it an even 100.\" On Friday and Saturday there were two boxes: One for the ticket sales before 3:00 p.m., and then one for the remainder of the day. But on Sundays, Zelda kept all of the day's money in a single box. One of the boxes was missing, and there were four boxes remaining with the following amount of money: $1817 \n$4012 \n$2110 \n$4061 \"Call the sheriff,\" I said. \"I know who stole your money. And I also know who is responsible for cutting Marchelli’s rope!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First find out exactly what was taken.\n   •  Five cash-boxes should have been in Zelda’s trailer:  \n     – Friday (before 3 p.m.)  – Friday (after 3 p.m.)  \n     – Saturday (before 3 p.m.) – Saturday (after 3 p.m.)  \n     – Sunday (all day)\n   • When the theft is discovered there are four boxes that still contain money\n     ( \\$1 817 – \\$2 110 – \\$4 012 – \\$4 061 ) and one completely empty box with the\n     note in it.\n   • Zelda’s book says Friday totalled \\$3 927 and Saturday \\$8 073.  \n     \\$1 817 + \\$2 110 = \\$3 927  → the two Friday boxes are still there.  \n     \\$4 012 + \\$4 061 = \\$8 073 → the two Saturday boxes are still there.  \n     Therefore the empty box is the SUNDAY box – nothing else was touched.\n\n2. How much money did the thief carry away?  \n   Let S = Sunday takings, T = total weekend takings.  \n   The story tells us that every weekend “exactly one–third of that amount came from the\n   Sunday crowds”, so  S = T / 3.  \n   T = 3 927 + 8 073 + S = 12 000 + S  \n   Hence S = (12 000 + S)/3  → 2S = 12 000 → S = \\$6 000.  \n   The thief removed precisely \\$6 000, no more and no less.\n\n3. Meaning of the note “I took what you owed me.  Tonight the wire will snap”.\n   • “What you owed me” = \\$6 000 (only Sunday’s takings) – not random theft.\n   • The author also knew – and controlled – the breaking of the high-wire, therefore the same\n     person both stole the money and sabotaged the wire.\n\n4. Who had a motive to make the wire break?\n   • The ringmaster worships the high-wire act and is terrified of heights himself – he would\n     never deliberately wreck the circus’s proudest attraction.\n   • The Great Marchelli would never try to kill himself, and he cannot read or write, so he\n     could not have written the note.\n   • Zelda is a mathematician but has no reason to destroy the main act.\n   • The sheriff hates the circus, but the phrase “what you owed me” makes no sense for him,\n     and he would certainly have taken ALL the money if he wanted to discredit the show.\n   • Lorenzo, on the other hand, has a powerful motive:\n        – For two years he has begged for a place on the high wire.\n        – Marchelli’s fall would both remove his rival and prove that a new performer\n          was needed.  \n        – The \\$6 000 Sunday box is not an arbitrary figure to him: it is exactly one-third\n          of the week’s receipts – the share that would have gone to all the performers.\n          By stealing it he is taking “his” promotion money in advance and guaranteeing that\n          the others will blame the proud high-wire star when they read the note.\n\n5. Opportunity\n   • The wire must have been cut earlier in the afternoon, when the canvas workers were\n     rigging the tent and anyone could climb the centre pole without attracting attention.\n     Lorenzo, an acrobat who regularly helps with rigging, can do that easily.\n   • The only moment Zelda left her trailer unlocked was when the ringmaster sent her to fetch\n     the permit.  Lorenzo was standing near the ring entrance waiting for his cue and could\n     slip away for the thirty seconds required to open the Sunday box, remove the cash and\n     drop in his note.\n\n6. Physical/behavioural clues\n   • Lorenzo’s first outburst after the theft – “That’s OUR money!” – is much louder and more\n     emotional than anyone else’s, the typical reaction of a guilty man trying to appear\n     indignant.\n   • The ringmaster’s remark “Lorenzo needs to buy gifts for his family!” is an apparently\n     innocent joke that in hindsight points to Lorenzo’s sudden need for a large sum of cash.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLorenzo (ground acrobat), The Great Marchelli (high-wire star), Zelda (fortune-teller), The Ringmaster, Sheriff Trent\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nLorenzo – full name Lorenzo (surname not given)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFrustrated after two years of being kept on the ground, Lorenzo decides both to get\nrid of the Great Marchelli and to pay himself an advance “promotion bonus”.\nDuring the rigging of the big top on Sunday afternoon he climbs the centre pole and\ncuts half-way through the high-wire, weak enough to snap in the evening show.\nJust before the performance begins, the ringmaster orders Zelda to fetch the circus\npermit.  While Zelda is away Lorenzo slips into her trailer, unlocks the Sunday\ncash-box, removes the \\$6 000 and leaves his note: “I took what you owed me.\nTonight the wire will snap.”  He then locks the empty box, rejoins the performers\nand goes on stage.\nDuring the act the weakened wire breaks; Marchelli survives thanks to his skill but\nthe audience – and Lorenzo – are convinced he will be judged too unreliable to\ncontinue.  After the show the cash shortage is discovered.  Because only Sunday’s\ntakings are gone and a warning about the high-wire is in the box, suspicion is meant\nto fall automatically on Marchelli.  Lorenzo thinks he has cleared the way for his\nown promotion and pocketed enough money to keep his family comfortable – until the\nnumbers in Zelda’s ledger, and the logical link between the theft and the sabotage,\nlead the detective to him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• The Great Marchelli: cannot read or write, would not place a written note; no reason\n  to risk his own life for a theft that gives him far more than his weekly pay.\n• Zelda: loves her reputation for precision – she would never tamper with her own\n  accounts, and she certainly could not reach the high-wire to saw through it.\n• The Ringmaster: the stolen money was already under his control; destroying the act\n  he is proudest of would be self-defeating, and his fear of heights makes it almost\n  impossible for him to sabotage the wire personally.\n• Sheriff Trent: he despises the circus but the note speaks of being “owed” money,\n  something that does not apply to him; moreover, he would have taken all five boxes\n  to make his point, not just one.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Staring back at him were the accusing eyes of the ringmaster, my father, our star performer and our fake gypsy. Each one had been proven more honest than the sheriff himself.\n\"Now we know who's the real crook.\"",

Get out of our village now!\" \"We received this permit months ago,\" said our ringmaster with laughter and warmth. \"And an honorable man like yourself wouldn't want to disappoint your 3,000 neighbors sharing a friendly evening with our circus family.\" The sheriff demanded a look at the permit and a chance to inspect the facilities, insisting that each customer in this dangerous place meant more work for his department on a Sunday night. The ringmaster continued flattering the sheriff, knowing we couldn't afford to cancel the Sunday show. It was an almost magical tradition – each weekend no matter how much money the circus earned, exactly one-third of that amount came from the Sunday crowds. But now the tight-wire had broken, and one of our performers was falling towards the ground! It was a 100-foot drop, and the audience gasped, but Lorenzo and I felt even more frightened. The falling man was the “Great Marchelli\" -- the proudest member of our circus family. We watched as Marchelli leaned his falling body forward. Suddenly he grabbed his knees and somehow hurled his legs over his head, doing an erratic somersault in the air. As he tried to propel his body into the safety net, he fell and missed! But Marchelli, being great, quickly stretched his arm out, grabbing desperately for the net's edge as he fell. The net stretched tight, stopping Marchelli's fall, and as the net sprung back into position, Marchelli used its momentum to hurl himself up into another confident somersault. He landed gracefully in the net on one knee, his arms stretched proudly. Marchelli glowed with pride and even arrogance. He spent his childhood in the circus, never learning to read or write, so he took an extra pride in his great performing skills. It was the ringmaster who was most concerned. With the sheriff arguing that circus people were crooks, he'd wanted to look organized and in control. And because the ringmaster was afraid of heights himself, he was most proud of the circus high-wire act. He shouted praise to the audience about the Great Marchelli. He added that circus life was full of excitement and surprises, and its trained experts were ready for anything. Though, his excitement would disappear when he found out he had been robbed. When the crowds left for the night, Zelda, the fortune teller, removed her wig of wild dark hair, and put on a pair of glasses. Privately she was proud of her ability with math, and she wanted everyone to know they could rely on her numbers. \"Lorenzo needs to buy gifts for his family!\" said the ringmaster with a smile, walking with my father into her trailer. But during the circus's performance, the money had been stolen. \"And there's something even stranger,\" Zelda said honestly. \"They didn't steal all of it!\" The money was locked in metal boxes, and every day in her book Zelda recorded the amount in each box before handing them over to the ringmaster on Sunday nights. After she'd reviewed the figures in her mysterious black book, she'd reached her startling conclusion. \"They stole some of our money?\" the ringmaster asked, genuinely puzzled. \"But why?\" \"The thief left us a note,\" Zelda replied, pulling a folder piece of paper from one metal box, sitting empty on her desk. It read: I took what you owed me. Tonight the wire will snap. \"That's our money!\" shouted Lorenzo angrily, as the ringmaster eyed him with suspicion, \nrecalling Lorenzo's eagerness to join the high-wire act. \"It wasn't me,\" Lorenzo protested as we left. \"Maybe the Great Marchelli sabotaged his own act, determined to steal the spotlight one more time!\" I wondered if Marchelli had a plan that was even more wicked. Maybe he'd faked that spectacular fall, just to cast suspicion on my father. That would ensure that my father would never be promoted into his place. Zelda wailed that she'd guarded the money carefully. \"The money could only have been stolen after the circus started -- and even then I was only gone for minutes to get our permit for the sheriff.\" Did the sheriff ask you himself? \"No,\" she said hesitantly. \"The ringmaster sent me to retrieve it from his desk in the front wagon.\" Her eyes focused, deep in thought, as she tried to imagine what happened in that time. Had his worries over profitability forced him to \"steal\" some money to hide it from his employees? We opened her book of numbers: Friday: $3927 \nSaturday: $8073 \"I didn't even get to finish calculating the numbers for Sunday! Zelda wailed. Was there anyone who was owed money? \"No!\" Zelda exclaimed. \"Everyone is paid equally, and always at the end of the week!\" she sighed. \"The ringmaster insists that each one of us be treated the same – except Marchelli, who gets a double share. There are 99 of us, and Marchelli's extra share makes it an even 100.\" On Friday and Saturday there were two boxes: One for the ticket sales before 3:00 p.m., and then one for the remainder of the day. But on Sundays, Zelda kept all of the day's money in a single box. One of the boxes was missing, and there were four boxes remaining with the following amount of money: $1817 \n$4012 \n$2110 \n$4061 \"Call the sheriff,\" I said. \"I know who stole your money. And I also know who is responsible for cutting Marchelli’s rope!”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Great Marchelli; (b) Lorenzo; (c) Ringmaster; (d) Sheriff",
      "answer": "(d) Sheriff",
      "outcome": "\"The numbers for Friday and Saturday add up to $12,000, we can calculate that the\nSunday box should've held $6,000 -- one-third of the weekend total. That must be the box that's missing.\"\n\"The thief's note warned that: \"I only took what you owed me.\" But none of our performers were owed $6,000. Using Zelda's figures, each person's share this week would be just one hundredth of $18,000 -- or $180 apiece. To be owed $6,000, they'd have to have gone unpaid for something close to 30 weeks. And I'm sure the ringmaster would've heard about that by now!\"\n\"What if it was the ringmaster himself who stole the money and cut the cable?\" asked the sheriff.\n\"He couldn't have,\" I pointed out. \"The ringmaster is afraid of heights, and couldn't possibly have climbed that pole to cut the cable.\"\n\"I think Lorenzo stole the money!\" shouted the great Marchelli. \"He's been after my extra salary for two years.\"\n\"He works hard, that's for sure,\" I continued. \"In fact, tonight's acrobatic performance for more than three hours wouldn't leave any time to steal the money. Zelda said it was stolen during the performance!\"\n\"Maybe Marchelli stole the money,\" Lorenzo shot back.\n\"I doubt the Great Marchelli left us a note,\" I pointed out, \"since the great Marchelli can't even read or write.\"\nEveryone looked around sullenly. \"I can't imagine it's one of us,\" I continued.\n\"But who's the man who insisted that each customer Sunday made more work for him?\"\nThe sheriff looked up, his face red with embarrassment. Staring back at him were the accusing eyes of the ringmaster, my father, our star performer and our fake gypsy. Each one had been proven more honest than the sheriff himself.\n\"Now we know who's the real crook.\""
