    "full_text": "Monday, March 31, 2008 The day began pleasantly enough in Oklahoma City. It was sunny, but as was often the case this time of year, windy and cool – much the same as it was on the day 27 years (and one day) ago, when the attempt was made on President Reagan’s life. There was a reason Johnny Woodward’s group did not meet on Tuesdays. They met every Monday morning for breakfast at Faye’s Café. The group, which now called themselves the ROB (Retired Old Boys) Club, dined in a private room. Johnny was especially grateful for the privacy this morning, as he did not wish for anyone to overhear what he was planning to discuss. During breakfast, he did not say or do anything that would cause the others alarm, although a couple of friends noticed that he was unusually tense. Johnny looked around the table at his four best friends. There were -- at one point in time -- six of them, including himself. But Eddie had died the same afternoon of the unsuccessful attempt on President Reagan’s life. Eddie had died on a Tuesday. And Johnny knew Eddie had been murdered. He knew also that the killer was at the table with them. Johnny didn’t completely understand his motive for doing what he was about to do. He was weary of carrying such a dark and burdensome secret all these years, but mainly he had come to realize that none of them were growing any younger, and that justice had to be carried out soon. He would not be able to live with himself any longer if the murderer continued to go on without suffering the consequences for what he had done. He also felt it would be right to allow Eddie’s family some measure of closure. He had covered for the killer long enough. After the dishes were cleared away and the coffee cups were refilled, the ROB’s favorite waitress, Mona, excused herself and, at Johnny’s request, shut the door to the private dining room. “Why did you have her do that?” asked Tim, who had worked for Johnny, as they all had, before retiring from the network department of the local school system. Johnny took a deep breath and replied, “Because we have something important to discuss.” Al, alarmed, asked, “And what would that be?” Swallowing the lump in his throat, Johnny continued, “You know yesterday was Eddie’s 27th anniversary. I have to tell you, he didn’t just die. One of us murdered him. Had it not been for the intense focus on the Reagan shooting that afternoon, I’m certain he would have been found out.” The table became eerily quiet. Al again spoke, asking, “How do you know this?” Johnny took a deep breath, “Does everyone remember where we were on that day? It was a Tuesday. It was a hectic day for me as my grandfather passed away that morning. Plus we had that big computer upgrade going on. President Reagan getting shot only added more stress to an already too long day.” “Yeah, I remember,” said Al, “we were all in the computer room. I remember we were all freezing in that cold room.” “That’s right, agreed Johnny, “and it was assumed Eddie died of a heart attack.” “Right after we heard Reagan had been shot.” Ray added. “I remember the computer room had a television set with cable, which was a novelty at the time and something Johnny got for us as a favor. When news of the shooting came on, everyone’s attention turned to the news. It was 1:40 p.m. and the upgrade was nearing completion.” Everyone focused intently on Johnny as he began to speak. “As you recall, that morning we gathered early for our upgrade. I arrived first to unlock the computer room and cabinets.” Johnny smiled, and then continued, “I would have had one of you do that, but back then only managers carried keys. Recall also that our whole team was involved in it, as it was 1981 and one of the first major IT upgrades. By 1:45 p.m. or so, all was going well and we had the television on. Reagan had been shot at about 1:30 p.m. central time, and news of this was on all of the major channels. It provided enough distraction to give the killer an excellent opportunity to lace Eddie’s cup of coffee with poison. As I recall, Eddie drank the fateful swallow as we watched video clips of the shooting.” Incredulous, Watson asked, “How do you know he was poisoned?” “The killer left the half empty bottle of poison in a cabinet drawer -- it was a huge bottle, not easily concealed, and I didn’t retrieve it until a couple of months later.” Al angrily asked, “So who did it?” Johnny took turns looking at them all. He said, “I don’t want to finger the killer until we talk this out.” Tim replied, sadly, “OK. Let’s go back to square one. When the television flashed the news about the shooting, we gathered around the file table. The coffee was brewed by me and poured before the cups were taken to the table. Al was already at the table before the coffee was poured.” Al, thinking out loud, asked, “Who had the poison and when was it slipped into Eddie’s coffee?” Johnny said, “Let’s continue. Watson and I wore lab coats in the computer room to say warm. We could have easily hid a bottle in our jackets.” Tim said, “I had on a long sleeve shirt that day, with blue jeans but no jacket. I was freezing.” Ray said, “I had on a short sleeve shirt and slacks. I’m always warm, so the cold felt good.” Watson said, slowly, “I poured the coffee into the cups. I noticed what I believed to be an inch of standing water in one of them by the tray’s edge. I remember this because it was a bit fuller than the others after I poured and I was concerned that the server would splash it on his shirt. I didn’t think anything more of it, other than I thought it would help to cool the hot coffee. Besides, I didn’t serve the coffee. Johnny did.” Johnny asked, “So the poison was in the cup when you poured it?” “Yes.” Al, who had been silent for a while, said, “I remember Johnny brought the coffee over. If I recall, you asked everyone to take a cup from the tray.” “That’s correct.” “Wasn’t Eddie the last one served?” “Yes.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Identify who had to do WHAT, WHEN and HOW for the murder to succeed  \n   • Poison had to be put into one coffee-cup before the pot of coffee was poured.  \n   • After the pot was poured, someone had to make sure that that particular cup went to Eddie.  \n\n2. Look at the order of handling the cups  \n   – Tim says he BREWED the coffee and “poured it before the cups were taken to the table.”  \n   – Watson contradicts this and says HE actually poured the coffee into the cups and noticed about an inch of clear liquid already standing in one cup on the rim of the tray.  \n   – Johnny then picked up the tray and personally served the cups, asking the others to “take a cup from the tray.” Eddie was the LAST man to receive a cup.  \n   ⇒ Whoever served could control which cup Eddie finally got.\n\n3. Who could have slipped the liquid poison into the cup?  \n   A. Anyone who was near the tray BEFORE Watson (or Tim) poured, when the cups were still empty.  \n   B. The poisoner needed a place to hide a “huge bottle not easily concealed.” It ended up inside a LOCKED equipment cabinet. Only managers, i.e. Johnny, carried the keys. The cabinet was unlocked by Johnny in the morning and would be locked again by Johnny when he left for the night.  \n   ⇒ A non-manager would have risked being seen re-opening a locked cabinet later. Johnny could do it unnoticed.\n\n4. The bottle was “retrieved” only months later—by Johnny  \n   • If Johnny were innocent he would have taken the bottle straight to security or the police the moment he found it.  \n   • Keeping it hidden for 27 years is consistent only with the bottle belonging to him in the first place.\n\n5. Opportunity to control the fatal cup  \n   • Johnny alone had the tray in his hands and deliberately made Eddie the last to be served, ensuring the poisoned cup reached its intended victim.\n\n6. Motive  \n   • The story never states Johnny’s motive, yet it shows he has been “carrying a dark and burdensome secret all these years” and is “weary of covering for the killer”—classic indications of a guilty conscience.  \n   • The whole meeting looks like a staged confession in which Johnny hopes to push suspicion onto somebody else before any of them dies of old age.\n\n7. Logical contradiction that exposes Johnny  \n   • Johnny insists the murder happened on a Tuesday, but the Reagan shooting occurred on a Monday (30 March 1981). This “mistake” can only be made deliberately by the man inventing the story for the others, not by an eyewitness who has replayed the true events in his head for 27 years.\n\nConclusion: the only person who (a) had the key to the hiding place, (b) handled the tray so he could steer the tainted cup to Eddie, (c) possessed the bottle long afterward, and (d) shows the classic signs of an unburdening conscience, is Johnny Woodward himself. No evidence points to an accomplice.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohnny Woodward, Tim, Al, Ray, Watson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJohnny Woodward\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly on Tuesday (actually Monday) 30 March 1981 Johnny, the network-department manager, unlocked the computer room and its equipment cabinets. He also unlocked a small drawer inside one of the cabinets. Before the rest of the team arrived he poured a quantity of clear, deadly poison from a large bottle into one coffee cup and placed that cup on the edge of the serving tray. He then hid the half-empty bottle in the open cabinet drawer, intending to lock it again at day’s end.\n\nAround 1:30 p.m. the news of President Reagan’s shooting broke, drawing everyone’s attention to the television. Tim brewed a fresh pot; Watson (or, as thought by Tim, perhaps both of them) poured the coffee into the waiting cups. Because the poisoned cup already contained about an inch of clear liquid, it ended up slightly fuller than the others—something Watson noticed but misinterpreted as “standing water.”\n\nJohnny picked up the filled tray, invited the men to take their cups and maneuvered events so that Eddie was the last to receive a cup—the poisoned one. Moments later Eddie drank, collapsed and died. With all attention still riveted on the televised drama from Washington, the death was chalked up to an unexpected heart attack.\n\nAfter the others left for the day Johnny calmly locked the cabinet, securing the incriminating bottle inside. Several months later, when no one would connect it to Eddie’s death, he removed and disposed of it. He has lived with the guilt ever since and finally calls the meeting in 2008 to try to shift blame away from himself while “clearing his conscience.” \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nTim – brewed the coffee but never touched the cups after the poison was already present; had no control over which cup Eddie received; lacked the key to hide the bottle.  \nWatson – poured the coffee, noticed extra liquid in one cup, but did not serve the cups; again had no key and no ability to make sure Eddie got the tainted cup.  \nAl – was already seated at the table before the coffee appeared; never handled cups, pot, tray or cabinets.  \nRay – likewise handled none of the items connected with the poisoning, and had no access to the locked cabinet.\n\nOnly Johnny possessed the combination of access, opportunity to direct the fatal cup, possession of the poison bottle afterward, and the suspiciously flawed account of the day’s events.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

But Eddie had died the same afternoon of the unsuccessful attempt on President Reagan’s life. Eddie had died on a Tuesday. And Johnny knew Eddie had been murdered. He knew also that the killer was at the table with them. Johnny didn’t completely understand his motive for doing what he was about to do. He was weary of carrying such a dark and burdensome secret all these years, but mainly he had come to realize that none of them were growing any younger, and that justice had to be carried out soon.

Had it not been for the intense focus on the Reagan shooting that afternoon, I’m certain he would have been found out.” The table became eerily quiet. Al again spoke, asking, “How do you know this?” Johnny took a deep breath, “Does everyone remember where we were on that day? It was a Tuesday. It was a hectic day for me as my grandfather passed away that morning. Plus we had that big computer upgrade going on. President Reagan getting shot only added more stress to an already too long day.” “Yeah, I remember,” said Al, “we were all in the computer room. I remember we were all freezing in that cold room.” “That’s right, agreed Johnny, “and it was assumed Eddie died of a heart attack.” “Right after we heard Reagan had been shot.” Ray added. “I remember the computer room had a television set with cable, which was a novelty at the time and something Johnny got for us as a favor.

When the television flashed the news about the shooting, we gathered around the file table. The coffee was brewed by me and poured before the cups were taken to the table. Al was already at the table before the coffee was poured.” Al, thinking out loud, asked, “Who had the poison and when was it slipped into Eddie’s coffee?” Johnny said, “Let’s continue. Watson and I wore lab coats in the computer room to say warm. We could have easily hid a bottle in our jackets.” Tim said, “I had on a long sleeve shirt that day, with blue jeans but no jacket. I was freezing.” Ray said, “I had on a short sleeve shirt and slacks. I’m always warm, so the cold felt good.” Watson said, slowly, “I poured the coffee into the cups.

I remember this because it was a bit fuller than the others after I poured and I was concerned that the server would splash it on his shirt. I didn’t think anything more of it, other than I thought it would help to cool the hot coffee. Besides, I didn’t serve the coffee.

    "reveal_text": "The murderer smiled a thin smile. Everyone could see the look of guilt upon his face. He said, “Is everyone in agreement?”\nWatson said, “I don’t know. Will someone please explain.”\n“Well, we know it wasn’t me” Al said. “I was already sitting when the coffee was brought over. So, I would have taken a big chance on selecting what we knew was a poisoned cup from the tray. We also know it wasn’t Ray or Tim. They couldn’t have snuck a bottle of poison into the lab at an earlier time without Johnny unlocking it for them, and neither wore clothing baggy or loose enough to conceal a container on upgrade day.”\nAl paused for moment, fighting emotion, he knew he was going to soon accuse an old and dear friend of murder. Looking at Johnny, he said, “That leaves you and Watson.” Pausing again, he said to Watson, “You poured the coffee and knew which cup had liquid in the bottom. That’s pretty damning, old friend.”\n“Yes, replied Watson, calmly, “but I didn’t serve the drinks.”\n“No you didn’t.” The room fell silent, waiting for Al to finish. “Johnny, it was you. You were you the only person who could have retrieved the poison a couple of months later, in a locked cabinet in a locked room … where you were the only one who possessed a key to both. I believe you owe all of us an explanation.”\nJohnny’s look of guilt turned to one of relief. Quietly, he said to them, “Recall that my grandfather had been ill. In fact he died the morning of the Reagan shooting. I had helped my parents for some time to pay his medical bills and money was tight. I had also loaned Eddie some money a few months earlier and he told me he was unable to pay me back. That’s not much of an explanation, but there it is. The pressure got to me and it frightens me to this day that one can so easily be led to murder. I like to think that I would have backed out of hurting Eddie, but the importance of the upgrade and the attempt on the president’s life threw me over an emotional edge. John Hinckley was not the only disturbed person to attempt murder that day. I wish now that I had failed as he did.”",

Recall also that our whole team was involved in it, as it was 1981 and one of the first major IT upgrades. By 1:45 p.m. or so, all was going well and we had the television on. Reagan had been shot at about 1:30 p.m. central time, and news of this was on all of the major channels. It provided enough distraction to give the killer an excellent opportunity to lace Eddie’s cup of coffee with poison. As I recall, Eddie drank the fateful swallow as we watched video clips of the shooting.” Incredulous, Watson asked, “How do you know he was poisoned?” “The killer left the half empty bottle of poison in a cabinet drawer -- it was a huge bottle, not easily concealed, and I didn’t retrieve it until a couple of months later.” Al angrily asked, “So who did it?” Johnny took turns looking at them all. He said, “I don’t want to finger the killer until we talk this out.” Tim replied, sadly, “OK. Let’s go back to square one. When the television flashed the news about the shooting, we gathered around the file table. The coffee was brewed by me and poured before the cups were taken to the table. Al was already at the table before the coffee was poured.” Al, thinking out loud, asked, “Who had the poison and when was it slipped into Eddie’s coffee?” Johnny said, “Let’s continue. Watson and I wore lab coats in the computer room to say warm. We could have easily hid a bottle in our jackets.” Tim said, “I had on a long sleeve shirt that day, with blue jeans but no jacket. I was freezing.” Ray said, “I had on a short sleeve shirt and slacks. I’m always warm, so the cold felt good.” Watson said, slowly, “I poured the coffee into the cups. I noticed what I believed to be an inch of standing water in one of them by the tray’s edge. I remember this because it was a bit fuller than the others after I poured and I was concerned that the server would splash it on his shirt. I didn’t think anything more of it, other than I thought it would help to cool the hot coffee. Besides, I didn’t serve the coffee. Johnny did.” Johnny asked, “So the poison was in the cup when you poured it?” “Yes.” Al, who had been silent for a while, said, “I remember Johnny brought the coffee over. If I recall, you asked everyone to take a cup from the tray.” “That’s correct.” “Wasn’t Eddie the last one served?” “Yes.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Al Gibson; (b) Johnny Woodward; (c) Ray Shields; (d) Tim Acord; (e) Watson Treadway",
      "answer": "(b) Johnny Woodward",
      "outcome": "The murderer smiled a thin smile. Everyone could see the look of guilt upon his face. He said, “Is everyone in agreement?”\nWatson said, “I don’t know. Will someone please explain.”\n“Well, we know it wasn’t me” Al said. “I was already sitting when the coffee was brought over. So, I would have taken a big chance on selecting what we knew was a poisoned cup from the tray. We also know it wasn’t Ray or Tim. They couldn’t have snuck a bottle of poison into the lab at an earlier time without Johnny unlocking it for them, and neither wore clothing baggy or loose enough to conceal a container on upgrade day.”\nAl paused for moment, fighting emotion, he knew he was going to soon accuse an old and dear friend of murder. Looking at Johnny, he said, “That leaves you and Watson.” Pausing again, he said to Watson, “You poured the coffee and knew which cup had liquid in the bottom. That’s pretty damning, old friend.”\n“Yes, replied Watson, calmly, “but I didn’t serve the drinks.”\n“No you didn’t.” The room fell silent, waiting for Al to finish. “Johnny, it was you. You were you the only person who could have retrieved the poison a couple of months later, in a locked cabinet in a locked room … where you were the only one who possessed a key to both. I believe you owe all of us an explanation.”\nJohnny’s look of guilt turned to one of relief. Quietly, he said to them, “Recall that my grandfather had been ill. In fact he died the morning of the Reagan shooting. I had helped my parents for some time to pay his medical bills and money was tight. I had also loaned Eddie some money a few months earlier and he told me he was unable to pay me back. That’s not much of an explanation, but there it is. The pressure got to me and it frightens me to this day that one can so easily be led to murder. I like to think that I would have backed out of hurting Eddie, but the importance of the upgrade and the attempt on the president’s life threw me over an emotional edge. John Hinckley was not the only disturbed person to attempt murder that day. I wish now that I had failed as he did.”"
