    "full_text": "Monday, March 31, 2008 The day began pleasantly enough in Oklahoma City. It was sunny, but as was often the case this time of year, windy and cool – much the same as it was on the day 27 years (and one day) ago, when the attempt was made on President Reagan’s life. There was a reason Johnny Woodward’s group did not meet on Tuesdays. They met every Monday morning for breakfast at Faye’s Café. The group, which now called themselves the ROB (Retired Old Boys) Club, dined in a private room. Johnny was especially grateful for the privacy this morning, as he did not wish for anyone to overhear what he was planning to discuss. During breakfast, he did not say or do anything that would cause the others alarm, although a couple of friends noticed that he was unusually tense. Johnny looked around the table at his four best friends. There were -- at one point in time -- six of them, including himself. But Eddie had died the same afternoon of the unsuccessful attempt on President Reagan’s life. Eddie had died on a Tuesday. And Johnny knew Eddie had been murdered. He knew also that the killer was at the table with them. Johnny didn’t completely understand his motive for doing what he was about to do. He was weary of carrying such a dark and burdensome secret all these years, but mainly he had come to realize that none of them were growing any younger, and that justice had to be carried out soon. He would not be able to live with himself any longer if the murderer continued to go on without suffering the consequences for what he had done. He also felt it would be right to allow Eddie’s family some measure of closure. He had covered for the killer long enough. After the dishes were cleared away and the coffee cups were refilled, the ROB’s favorite waitress, Mona, excused herself and, at Johnny’s request, shut the door to the private dining room. “Why did you have her do that?” asked Tim, who had worked for Johnny, as they all had, before retiring from the network department of the local school system. Johnny took a deep breath and replied, “Because we have something important to discuss.” Al, alarmed, asked, “And what would that be?” Swallowing the lump in his throat, Johnny continued, “You know yesterday was Eddie’s 27th anniversary. I have to tell you, he didn’t just die. One of us murdered him. Had it not been for the intense focus on the Reagan shooting that afternoon, I’m certain he would have been found out.” The table became eerily quiet. Al again spoke, asking, “How do you know this?” Johnny took a deep breath, “Does everyone remember where we were on that day? It was a Tuesday. It was a hectic day for me as my grandfather passed away that morning. Plus we had that big computer upgrade going on. President Reagan getting shot only added more stress to an already too long day.” “Yeah, I remember,” said Al, “we were all in the computer room. I remember we were all freezing in that cold room.” “That’s right, agreed Johnny, “and it was assumed Eddie died of a heart attack.” “Right after we heard Reagan had been shot.” Ray added. “I remember the computer room had a television set with cable, which was a novelty at the time and something Johnny got for us as a favor. When news of the shooting came on, everyone’s attention turned to the news. It was 1:40 p.m. and the upgrade was nearing completion.” Everyone focused intently on Johnny as he began to speak. “As you recall, that morning we gathered early for our upgrade. I arrived first to unlock the computer room and cabinets.” Johnny smiled, and then continued, “I would have had one of you do that, but back then only managers carried keys. Recall also that our whole team was involved in it, as it was 1981 and one of the first major IT upgrades. By 1:45 p.m. or so, all was going well and we had the television on. Reagan had been shot at about 1:30 p.m. central time, and news of this was on all of the major channels. It provided enough distraction to give the killer an excellent opportunity to lace Eddie’s cup of coffee with poison. As I recall, Eddie drank the fateful swallow as we watched video clips of the shooting.” Incredulous, Watson asked, “How do you know he was poisoned?” “The killer left the half empty bottle of poison in a cabinet drawer -- it was a huge bottle, not easily concealed, and I didn’t retrieve it until a couple of months later.” Al angrily asked, “So who did it?” Johnny took turns looking at them all. He said, “I don’t want to finger the killer until we talk this out.” Tim replied, sadly, “OK. Let’s go back to square one. When the television flashed the news about the shooting, we gathered around the file table. The coffee was brewed by me and poured before the cups were taken to the table. Al was already at the table before the coffee was poured.” Al, thinking out loud, asked, “Who had the poison and when was it slipped into Eddie’s coffee?” Johnny said, “Let’s continue. Watson and I wore lab coats in the computer room to say warm. We could have easily hid a bottle in our jackets.” Tim said, “I had on a long sleeve shirt that day, with blue jeans but no jacket. I was freezing.” Ray said, “I had on a short sleeve shirt and slacks. I’m always warm, so the cold felt good.” Watson said, slowly, “I poured the coffee into the cups. I noticed what I believed to be an inch of standing water in one of them by the tray’s edge. I remember this because it was a bit fuller than the others after I poured and I was concerned that the server would splash it on his shirt. I didn’t think anything more of it, other than I thought it would help to cool the hot coffee. Besides, I didn’t serve the coffee. Johnny did.” Johnny asked, “So the poison was in the cup when you poured it?” “Yes.” Al, who had been silent for a while, said, “I remember Johnny brought the coffee over. If I recall, you asked everyone to take a cup from the tray.” “That’s correct.” “Wasn’t Eddie the last one served?” “Yes.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could get to a large bottle of poison?  \n   – Only the person who had the cabinet keys.  Johnny himself says that in 1981 “only managers carried keys” and that he alone unlocked the computer-room cabinets that morning.  \n   – Whoever put the half-empty bottle back in the cabinet (where Johnny says he later found it) also had to have a key when the room was locked again.\n\n2. When was the poison added?  \n   – Watson states there was already “an inch of standing water” in one cup before he poured coffee.  Therefore the poison was put in the cup before anybody carried the tray to the table.\n\n3. Who could make sure Eddie – and nobody else – got that particular cup?  \n   – The only person who handled the tray after the cups were filled was Johnny.  He “asked everyone to take a cup from the tray,” and Eddie was “the last one served.”  Johnny could therefore see which cup was the fuller one and simply see to it that Eddie got it.\n\n4. Who could have concealed a big bottle while moving it?  \n   – The only two men wearing roomy lab coats were Johnny and Watson.  \n   – But Watson had no keys; he could not have locked the evidence back in the cabinet.  \n   – Johnny had both the keys and the coat.\n\n5. Johnny’s own words give him away.  He says he “covered for the killer” and that he personally “retrieved” the bottle months later.  No one but the killer (who knew exactly where it was) and the key-holder (Johnny) could have done that.\n\nThe combination of exclusive key possession, ability to hide the bottle, ability to choose the victim’s cup, and later possession of the incriminating bottle can belong to only one man—Johnny Woodward.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohnny Woodward, Al, Tim, Ray, Watson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJohnny Woodward\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly Tuesday morning, Johnny unlocked the computer-room cabinets.  Inside one drawer he had already hidden a large bottle of liquid poison.  During the morning upgrade work he took the bottle out under his lab coat, poured roughly an inch of the poison into one of the empty coffee cups that were waiting on the serving tray, and slipped the bottle back into the cabinet drawer.  A few minutes later Watson came by and filled all six cups with coffee; the poisoned cup now looked simply “a bit fuller” than the others.\n\nWhen the television bulletin about President Reagan came on, Johnny picked up the tray, walked to the table and told everyone to take a cup.  Watching the levels, he maneuvered the others to choose the safe cups, leaving the fuller one for Eddie, who therefore ended up being “last served.”  With everyone’s attention fixed on the dramatic news footage, Eddie drank; within minutes he collapsed and died.  Because the whole city was buzzing about the assassination attempt on the President, Eddie’s death was written off as a sudden heart attack.\n\nAfter the excitement died down, Johnny locked the cabinets for the night—trapping the half-empty poison bottle in the drawer where only he could reach it.  Months later, fearing discovery, he quietly removed the bottle but chose to keep silent—“covering for the killer”—until the burden of guilt finally became too great twenty-seven years later.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAl – Was already sitting at the table before any coffee was poured, so he never had access to the tray or cups.  He also had no keys to the cabinets.\n\nTim – Brewed the coffee, but he had no coat to conceal a large bottle and no way to guarantee the doctored cup would reach Eddie.  He likewise lacked the cabinet keys needed to hide the poison afterward.\n\nRay – Like Tim, he wore only a short-sleeved shirt, never handled the cups, and possessed no keys.\n\nWatson – He did pour the coffee, but the poison was in the cup before he touched it, and once Johnny carried the tray Watson had no control over who received which cup.  Most decisively, Watson had no key with which to lock the poison in the cabinet and could not have “retrieved” it months later.\n\nOnly Johnny Woodward satisfies every necessary condition: opportunity, means, continued control of the evidence, and the ability to be certain the poisoned cup reached Eddie.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The murderer smiled a thin smile. Everyone could see the look of guilt upon his face. He said, “Is everyone in agreement?”\nWatson said, “I don’t know. Will someone please explain.”\n“Well, we know it wasn’t me” Al said. “I was already sitting when the coffee was brought over. So, I would have taken a big chance on selecting what we knew was a poisoned cup from the tray. We also know it wasn’t Ray or Tim. They couldn’t have snuck a bottle of poison into the lab at an earlier time without Johnny unlocking it for them, and neither wore clothing baggy or loose enough to conceal a container on upgrade day.”\nAl paused for moment, fighting emotion, he knew he was going to soon accuse an old and dear friend of murder. Looking at Johnny, he said, “That leaves you and Watson.” Pausing again, he said to Watson, “You poured the coffee and knew which cup had liquid in the bottom. That’s pretty damning, old friend.”\n“Yes, replied Watson, calmly, “but I didn’t serve the drinks.”\n“No you didn’t.” The room fell silent, waiting for Al to finish. “Johnny, it was you. You were you the only person who could have retrieved the poison a couple of months later, in a locked cabinet in a locked room … where you were the only one who possessed a key to both. I believe you owe all of us an explanation.”\nJohnny’s look of guilt turned to one of relief. Quietly, he said to them, “Recall that my grandfather had been ill. In fact he died the morning of the Reagan shooting. I had helped my parents for some time to pay his medical bills and money was tight. I had also loaned Eddie some money a few months earlier and he told me he was unable to pay me back. That’s not much of an explanation, but there it is. The pressure got to me and it frightens me to this day that one can so easily be led to murder. I like to think that I would have backed out of hurting Eddie, but the importance of the upgrade and the attempt on the president’s life threw me over an emotional edge. John Hinckley was not the only disturbed person to attempt murder that day. I wish now that I had failed as he did.”",

I remember this because it was a bit fuller than the others after I poured and I was concerned that the server would splash it on his shirt. I didn’t think anything more of it, other than I thought it would help to cool the hot coffee. Besides, I didn’t serve the coffee. Johnny did.” Johnny asked, “So the poison was in the cup when you poured it?” “Yes.” Al, who had been silent for a while, said, “I remember Johnny brought the coffee over. If I recall, you asked everyone to take a cup from the tray.” “That’s correct.” “Wasn’t Eddie the last one served?” “Yes.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Al Gibson; (b) Johnny Woodward; (c) Ray Shields; (d) Tim Acord; (e) Watson Treadway",
      "answer": "(b) Johnny Woodward",
      "outcome": "The murderer smiled a thin smile. Everyone could see the look of guilt upon his face. He said, “Is everyone in agreement?”\nWatson said, “I don’t know. Will someone please explain.”\n“Well, we know it wasn’t me” Al said. “I was already sitting when the coffee was brought over. So, I would have taken a big chance on selecting what we knew was a poisoned cup from the tray. We also know it wasn’t Ray or Tim. They couldn’t have snuck a bottle of poison into the lab at an earlier time without Johnny unlocking it for them, and neither wore clothing baggy or loose enough to conceal a container on upgrade day.”\nAl paused for moment, fighting emotion, he knew he was going to soon accuse an old and dear friend of murder. Looking at Johnny, he said, “That leaves you and Watson.” Pausing again, he said to Watson, “You poured the coffee and knew which cup had liquid in the bottom. That’s pretty damning, old friend.”\n“Yes, replied Watson, calmly, “but I didn’t serve the drinks.”\n“No you didn’t.” The room fell silent, waiting for Al to finish. “Johnny, it was you. You were you the only person who could have retrieved the poison a couple of months later, in a locked cabinet in a locked room … where you were the only one who possessed a key to both. I believe you owe all of us an explanation.”\nJohnny’s look of guilt turned to one of relief. Quietly, he said to them, “Recall that my grandfather had been ill. In fact he died the morning of the Reagan shooting. I had helped my parents for some time to pay his medical bills and money was tight. I had also loaned Eddie some money a few months earlier and he told me he was unable to pay me back. That’s not much of an explanation, but there it is. The pressure got to me and it frightens me to this day that one can so easily be led to murder. I like to think that I would have backed out of hurting Eddie, but the importance of the upgrade and the attempt on the president’s life threw me over an emotional edge. John Hinckley was not the only disturbed person to attempt murder that day. I wish now that I had failed as he did.”"
