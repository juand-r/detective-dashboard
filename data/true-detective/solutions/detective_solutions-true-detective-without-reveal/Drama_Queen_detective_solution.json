    "full_text": "The last thing Rebecca Williams ever expected when she auditioned for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof was to land the part of Maggie “the Cat” Pollitt. But there it was, posted on the corkboard right outside the theater doors: Rebecca’s name, followed by Maggie. “This has got to be some kind of mistake!” Isabelle’s shrieks reverberated through the drafty halls of the theater. “Where is Alfred? I simply won’t stand for this!” She marched into the director’s office and slammed the door behind her. Minutes later Isabelle stormed out of the director’s office, her face streaked with angry tears. “I’ll get you for this,” she hissed at Rebecca. She turned and pushed her way past Madge Anderson, who had just arrived, and exited the theater. “Wow,” Madge said, looking over the cast list. “Congratulations, Rebecca.” Rebecca blushed. “Thanks.” Madge smiled. “Looks like you’ve upset the balance of power around here.” “I didn’t mean to.” Madge laughed. “Don’t worry about it, Rebecca. Isabelle’s had the lead in the last three productions. It’s time for her to come back down to earth and play a supporting role.” Suddenly, the door swung open and James Fennimore stalked in, wearing his work clothes: blue coveralls and a hat that said Al’s Body shop. His eyes were narrowed as he approached the list on the door. “I don’t believe it,” he said, shaking his head. “What don’t you believe?” Madge asked. “This newbie here got the part of Maggie! Isabelle called me at the shop, crying and insisting I come by here and see for myself.” “So? She earned the part, James. It would be boring if the same people always got the big roles over and over. We would lose attendance.” “All you ever think about is making money!” “That’s not true, James, and you know it. We’re non-profit. Without the revenue from ticket-sales, we don’t put on more plays. It’s that simple.” “This is so bogus. Isabelle deserved that part. If anyone around here actually cared about talent and art, then she would have gotten the part.” “Stop it, James. We all know how you feel about Isabelle, but it’s not fair to Rebecca to suggest that she can’t perform Maggie just as well as Isabelle can.” “Well, I guess we won’t know until the time comes, now will we?” James’s jaw tightened as he turned towards Rebecca. “But listen here. I’m playing the part of Brick, so I’ll be performing opposite you. You’d better not screw this up.” “I won’t. I promise,” Rebecca said. “I’ll do my best.” “Of course you will,” Madge said. “You’d better do more than that,” James said. “You’d better be great. Or I’m never setting foot in this theater again. You hear that Madge? Good luck filling my shoes if I leave.” James spun around and walked out. “What a mess,” Madge moaned. “It’s so hard to get decent men in community theater. If James leaves, I don’t know who we’ll find to take his place.” “I’m sorry,” Rebecca said. “Maybe I should go talk to Mr. Cooper and tell him to give Isabelle the part.” “Everything will be just fine, Rebecca. Don’t give up your part. Isabelle will just have to get over herself. Now take your script and go learn your lines.” Rebecca took a script from the pile on a nearby card table and smiled weakly at Madge. “Here goes nothing.” Rehearsals began the next week. As a director, Alfred Cooper was intimidating: “I expect everyone to be at their best at every rehearsal. I also expect you to always on time. Imagine that each rehearsal is an actual performance. Do not disappoint me or your audience by being late or sloppy.” “He’s pretty demanding,” Rebecca whispered to Madge after Mr. Cooper’s speech. “He just expects you to do your best, and not waste anyone’s time. We all have to rely on each other for a successful performance. Are you still up for this?” “Yes, of course,” Rebecca said. She glanced over at James and Isabelle, who were whispering together. Isabelle glowered at her, and Rebecca quickly turned away. “She sure doesn’t like me.” “She doesn’t like anyone who’s competition. Just remember that Mr. Cooper gave you the part, so he obviously thinks you’re the best one for it.” They began reading lines and working on blocking. After rehearsal was over, Rebecca went backstage to get her things. She stopped and stood perfectly still when she heard Isabelle and James talking in the wings. “I told Mr. Cooper that it’s not fair! Her Maggie isn’t nearly as good as mine would be. All he said was that she was doing great and that as long as she doesn’t flake out and miss rehearsal then she gets to keep the part. It’s so unfair!” Isabelle looked over and caught Rebecca staring at her. “I hate you,” she whispered. Rebecca turned around quickly and left. The next day Rebecca took her script with her to work. In the afternoon she was surprised to look up and see Madge walk in. “What a nice surprise! Are you a patient of Dr. Green?” Rebecca asked. “Actually I am, but that’s not why I stopped by. My car got a flat tire and since I’m hopeless with anything mechanical, I don’t know how to change it. Luckily I was nearby and was able to make it to the parking lot. I called my husband to come and change the tire. I was wondering if I could wait inside here since it’s so cold outside.” “Of course you can,” Rebecca said. “Look, Rebecca,” Madge said. “I’ve talked to Mr. Cooper about Isabelle. He agrees that she’s been a real pain. He even admits that he almost wishes he’d given her the part of Maggie so she’d stop causing trouble. Sometimes I almost agree.” “Oh.” “No, wait, I’m not finished. He said that even though it would have been easier to give her the part, never has he for a moment regretted giving it to you. He said if he had to go back and do it over, he wouldn’t change a thing.” Rebecca sighed. “Thanks, Madge. I just wish Isabelle didn’t hate me so much.” “Don’t worry about Isabelle. She’s just moody because she hates her job at the bakery so much, and she takes it out on everyone around her. She’ll probably be in bad a mood tonight since she works all afternoon, but just ignore it.” Madge left as soon as her tire was changed. When the workday was finally over, Rebecca headed out to her car. She had just enough time to make it to rehearsal. She got into her car and turned the key, but nothing happened. She tried a few more times, but the car still wouldn’t start. Panicked, Rebecca called her car service. When he arrived, the service member opened her hood. “Looks like someone disconnected your battery,” he said, hooking the cables back up. “Thank you,” Rebecca said, jumping into the car. She sped over to the theater and ran inside. Alfred Cooper was standing with his hands on his hips. James, Isabelle and Madge were running lines. They all looked up when Rebecca ran in. “Nice of you to join us, Rebecca,” Mr. Cooper said. “But if you can’t take your commitment seriously, then I’m sure we can find someone else who can.” “No, please Mr. Cooper,” Rebecca said. “Someone disconnected the battery to my car while I was at work. I was set up!” Isabelle scoffed. “Oh sure, Rebecca. Like we’re going to believe that.” “No, it’s true!” Rebecca said. “And no matter what some of you think, I am definitely committed to being in this play. In fact, I’ll prove it by exposing the person who did this to me.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What had to be done?  \n   • Sabotage was limited to lifting the hood and loosening one of the battery cables – something that delays, but does not permanently damage, Rebecca’s car.  \n   • It had to be done in the doctor’s-office car park during the afternoon, while Rebecca was inside at work.\n\n2. Who had a strong motive?  \n   • Isabelle St. Clair – furious at losing the lead.  \n   • James Fennimore – wants Isabelle to have the part; threatened to quit if Rebecca “messed up.”  \n   • Madge Anderson – terrified of losing the only reliable male actor (James).  If Rebecca were thrown off the play for being “unreliable,” Isabelle would get the lead, James would stay, and ticket sales would be safe.  \n   • Alfred Cooper – none (he cast Rebecca).\n\n3. Who had a clear opportunity?  \n   • Saboteur had to know where Rebecca worked AND be in that car park that afternoon without arousing suspicion.  \n   • Isabelle was scheduled to work at the bakery “all afternoon.” No indication she left.  \n   • James was at Al’s Body Shop; nothing places him near the clinic.  \n   • Madge is the only character PROVEN to be on the scene. She walks in on Rebecca at work claiming a flat tyre, waits in the building, and then leaves the moment her husband finishes with the car.  \n     – That little drama gave Madge and her husband a completely natural reason to be crawling around cars in that very car park with tools.  \n     – While the husband loosened a wheel nut, he could just as easily put a spanner on Rebecca’s battery clamp (a ten-second job).  \n   • Madge’s “I’m hopeless with anything mechanical” is a convenient way to pre-empt suspicion.\n\n4. Behavioural clues  \n   • Madge keeps stressing how badly they need James to stay and how disastrous it would be if he quit.  \n   • Her visit to Rebecca is full of mixed messages: she claims to reassure Rebecca, yet repeats that Alfred “almost wishes” he’d given Isabelle the part – a remark that will rattle Rebecca if anything goes wrong.  \n   • No one else gains anything direct from merely delaying Rebecca, but Madge solves her James-problem if Rebecca is branded unreliable.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n   • Isabelle has motive but no demonstrated access to the car park.  \n   • James has mechanical skill but, again, no link to the location.  \n   • Madge alone combines motive, direct opportunity, a cover story that explains her presence and the possession of tools (via her husband), and a convenient “I know nothing about cars” disclaimer.\n\nTherefore, Madge is the planner and instigator; her husband, who actually loosened the cable while changing the tyre, is an unwitting or willing accomplice.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nIsabelle St. Clair, James Fennimore, Madge Anderson, Alfred Cooper\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMadge Anderson\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nMr. Anderson (Madge’s husband – first name not given)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarlier that day Madge decided that the simplest way to push Rebecca out of the play – and keep James happy – was to make her appear unreliable.  \n1. Madge deliberately let air out of (or punctured) one of her own tyres and drove to the doctor’s office where Rebecca works.  \n2. Inside, she chatted with Rebecca, planting the idea that Alfred “almost regrets” the casting decision – setting up the psychological blow that would follow.  \n3. Madge phoned her husband to “come fix the flat.” When he arrived, Madge directed him to her car, then pointed out Rebecca’s nearby vehicle.  \n4. While replacing the tyre, Mr. Anderson quickly popped Rebecca’s bonnet and loosened a battery terminal. Anyone who noticed would just see a man in work clothes doing something under a car hood.  \n5. Tyre changed, the Andersons left.  \n6. After work Rebecca found her disabled car, had to wait for road-service, and consequently reached rehearsal late – exactly what Madge wanted.  \n7. Madge expected Alfred to replace Rebecca with Isabelle, keeping James (and therefore the box-office draw) in the cast.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nIsabelle St. Clair – Although she had the strongest emotional motive, she was scheduled to work at the bakery all afternoon and nothing places her at the clinic car park.  No opportunity established.\n\nJames Fennimore – Knows about cars, but he spent the day at Al’s Body Shop; again, no evidence he knew Rebecca’s workplace or left work to sabotage her vehicle.\n\nAlfred Cooper – Gave Rebecca the part in the first place and would gain nothing by undermining his own casting choice.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

She said so herself.”\n“That’s definitely true!” Madge said.\nRebecca turned to Isabelle. “And it wasn’t you, Isabelle, because you were working at the bakery all afternoon. Looks like you brought some of it with you, too.” Isabelle gasped and looked down at her shirt. There was a smear of chocolate and powdered sugar on her chest.\n“And I know it wasn’t you, Mr. Cooper, because you told Madge that you wouldn’t change your casting decision even if you could. That only leaves James, who just happens to work at a body shop and has an extensive knowledge of cars.”\nMr. Cooper turned to James. “Well, James?”\nEveryone’s focus was on James. “Oh, fine!” he said. “I did it. I unhooked the cables to Rebecca’s car battery. But I only did it so Rebecca would be kicked out and Isabelle would get her part. I just wanted to make Isabelle happy.”\nMr. Cooper sighed. “Well, what should we do about this, Rebecca? It’s up to you. Should we recast James’s part?”\n“No,” Rebecca said. “Male parts are so hard to cast. But how about free oil changes for the entire cast, James?”\n“Deal,” James said.",

But there it was, posted on the corkboard right outside the theater doors: Rebecca’s name, followed by Maggie. “This has got to be some kind of mistake!” Isabelle’s shrieks reverberated through the drafty halls of the theater. “Where is Alfred? I simply won’t stand for this!” She marched into the director’s office and slammed the door behind her. Minutes later Isabelle stormed out of the director’s office, her face streaked with angry tears. “I’ll get you for this,” she hissed at Rebecca. She turned and pushed her way past Madge Anderson, who had just arrived, and exited the theater. “Wow,” Madge said, looking over the cast list. “Congratulations, Rebecca.” Rebecca blushed. “Thanks.” Madge smiled. “Looks like you’ve upset the balance of power around here.” “I didn’t mean to.” Madge laughed. “Don’t worry about it, Rebecca. Isabelle’s had the lead in the last three productions. It’s time for her to come back down to earth and play a supporting role.” Suddenly, the door swung open and James Fennimore stalked in, wearing his work clothes: blue coveralls and a hat that said Al’s Body shop. His eyes were narrowed as he approached the list on the door. “I don’t believe it,” he said, shaking his head. “What don’t you believe?” Madge asked. “This newbie here got the part of Maggie! Isabelle called me at the shop, crying and insisting I come by here and see for myself.” “So? She earned the part, James. It would be boring if the same people always got the big roles over and over. We would lose attendance.” “All you ever think about is making money!” “That’s not true, James, and you know it. We’re non-profit. Without the revenue from ticket-sales, we don’t put on more plays. It’s that simple.” “This is so bogus. Isabelle deserved that part. If anyone around here actually cared about talent and art, then she would have gotten the part.” “Stop it, James. We all know how you feel about Isabelle, but it’s not fair to Rebecca to suggest that she can’t perform Maggie just as well as Isabelle can.” “Well, I guess we won’t know until the time comes, now will we?” James’s jaw tightened as he turned towards Rebecca. “But listen here. I’m playing the part of Brick, so I’ll be performing opposite you. You’d better not screw this up.” “I won’t. I promise,” Rebecca said. “I’ll do my best.” “Of course you will,” Madge said. “You’d better do more than that,” James said. “You’d better be great. Or I’m never setting foot in this theater again. You hear that Madge? Good luck filling my shoes if I leave.” James spun around and walked out. “What a mess,” Madge moaned. “It’s so hard to get decent men in community theater. If James leaves, I don’t know who we’ll find to take his place.” “I’m sorry,” Rebecca said. “Maybe I should go talk to Mr. Cooper and tell him to give Isabelle the part.” “Everything will be just fine, Rebecca. Don’t give up your part. Isabelle will just have to get over herself. Now take your script and go learn your lines.” Rebecca took a script from the pile on a nearby card table and smiled weakly at Madge. “Here goes nothing.” Rehearsals began the next week. As a director, Alfred Cooper was intimidating: “I expect everyone to be at their best at every rehearsal. I also expect you to always on time. Imagine that each rehearsal is an actual performance. Do not disappoint me or your audience by being late or sloppy.” “He’s pretty demanding,” Rebecca whispered to Madge after Mr. Cooper’s speech. “He just expects you to do your best, and not waste anyone’s time. We all have to rely on each other for a successful performance. Are you still up for this?” “Yes, of course,” Rebecca said. She glanced over at James and Isabelle, who were whispering together. Isabelle glowered at her, and Rebecca quickly turned away. “She sure doesn’t like me.” “She doesn’t like anyone who’s competition. Just remember that Mr. Cooper gave you the part, so he obviously thinks you’re the best one for it.” They began reading lines and working on blocking. After rehearsal was over, Rebecca went backstage to get her things. She stopped and stood perfectly still when she heard Isabelle and James talking in the wings. “I told Mr. Cooper that it’s not fair! Her Maggie isn’t nearly as good as mine would be. All he said was that she was doing great and that as long as she doesn’t flake out and miss rehearsal then she gets to keep the part. It’s so unfair!” Isabelle looked over and caught Rebecca staring at her. “I hate you,” she whispered. Rebecca turned around quickly and left. The next day Rebecca took her script with her to work. In the afternoon she was surprised to look up and see Madge walk in. “What a nice surprise! Are you a patient of Dr. Green?” Rebecca asked. “Actually I am, but that’s not why I stopped by. My car got a flat tire and since I’m hopeless with anything mechanical, I don’t know how to change it. Luckily I was nearby and was able to make it to the parking lot. I called my husband to come and change the tire. I was wondering if I could wait inside here since it’s so cold outside.” “Of course you can,” Rebecca said. “Look, Rebecca,” Madge said. “I’ve talked to Mr. Cooper about Isabelle. He agrees that she’s been a real pain. He even admits that he almost wishes he’d given her the part of Maggie so she’d stop causing trouble. Sometimes I almost agree.” “Oh.” “No, wait, I’m not finished. He said that even though it would have been easier to give her the part, never has he for a moment regretted giving it to you. He said if he had to go back and do it over, he wouldn’t change a thing.” Rebecca sighed. “Thanks, Madge. I just wish Isabelle didn’t hate me so much.” “Don’t worry about Isabelle. She’s just moody because she hates her job at the bakery so much, and she takes it out on everyone around her. She’ll probably be in bad a mood tonight since she works all afternoon, but just ignore it.” Madge left as soon as her tire was changed. When the workday was finally over, Rebecca headed out to her car. She had just enough time to make it to rehearsal. She got into her car and turned the key, but nothing happened. She tried a few more times, but the car still wouldn’t start. Panicked, Rebecca called her car service. When he arrived, the service member opened her hood. “Looks like someone disconnected your battery,” he said, hooking the cables back up. “Thank you,” Rebecca said, jumping into the car. She sped over to the theater and ran inside. Alfred Cooper was standing with his hands on his hips. James, Isabelle and Madge were running lines. They all looked up when Rebecca ran in. “Nice of you to join us, Rebecca,” Mr. Cooper said. “But if you can’t take your commitment seriously, then I’m sure we can find someone else who can.” “No, please Mr. Cooper,” Rebecca said. “Someone disconnected the battery to my car while I was at work. I was set up!” Isabelle scoffed. “Oh sure, Rebecca. Like we’re going to believe that.” “No, it’s true!” Rebecca said. “And no matter what some of you think, I am definitely committed to being in this play. In fact, I’ll prove it by exposing the person who did this to me.”",

      "outcome": "“We’re listening, Rebecca,” Mr. Cooper said.\n“Well, let’s think about this,” Rebecca said. “I know Madge couldn’t have sabotaged my car, because she doesn’t know anything about cars. She said so herself.”\n“That’s definitely true!” Madge said.\nRebecca turned to Isabelle. “And it wasn’t you, Isabelle, because you were working at the bakery all afternoon. Looks like you brought some of it with you, too.” Isabelle gasped and looked down at her shirt. There was a smear of chocolate and powdered sugar on her chest.\n“And I know it wasn’t you, Mr. Cooper, because you told Madge that you wouldn’t change your casting decision even if you could. That only leaves James, who just happens to work at a body shop and has an extensive knowledge of cars.”\nMr. Cooper turned to James. “Well, James?”\nEveryone’s focus was on James. “Oh, fine!” he said. “I did it. I unhooked the cables to Rebecca’s car battery. But I only did it so Rebecca would be kicked out and Isabelle would get her part. I just wanted to make Isabelle happy.”\nMr. Cooper sighed. “Well, what should we do about this, Rebecca? It’s up to you. Should we recast James’s part?”\n“No,” Rebecca said. “Male parts are so hard to cast. But how about free oil changes for the entire cast, James?”\n“Deal,” James said."
