    "full_text": "I’m from a small town, which helps me to understand this one. Small towns have their strengths, sure. People tend to pitch in and help one another, even when the television news cameras are not recording what’s going on. But also, small towns can be inbred. People nourish their grievances, and then feed on them. That’s why I don’t think the really vicious crimes only happen in the big cities. There’s plenty of material for that right here in Centerville. And I see it, writing for the Chronicle. Actually, you might think the whole Davis clan was working here, from the bylines I get. The business and city hall reporting comes out under my real name, James Harding Davis. For the sports pages, they use my college nickname, Crusher Davis, which used to be pretty accurate on the football field. Not many plays came my way, when the offense got a good look at my build: six foot six and two-hundred-sixty-five pounds. So much for fame in a small town. Nowadays, the Chronicle reporter who gets the most readership is Ask Martha, the advice columnist, and yes, that’s me too … but don’t tell anybody. I didn’t know when I started the column that it would be such a help to the Centerville Police Department. CPD is a pretty fancy term for three people: Inspector Samuels, one deputy, and the City Council member who oversees the police, Linda Amberton. She glories in the title “Chief,” as if she knew anything about crime solving. Well, now she knows a lot more. As a matter of fact, “Chief” Linda Amberton was the one who brought the latest case to Inspector Samuels. She came in quietly—a rarity for her—eased herself into his private office, looked both ways, and then told her story. As Inspector Samuels told me over coffee not long afterward, she told him she had been the victim of a blackmail attempt. “My hat’s off to her,” Samuels said. “Not many people would have the courage to do what she did. Most would just pay up and hope it went away.” “I’m all ears, Inspector. Blackmail sounds like a call, or perhaps a letter, usually anonymous, and always untraceable.” “You’ve got that right, Mar—I mean Crusher. It was a letter that she found in her mailbox. There was no stamp, so it hadn’t gone through the system at all. Someone just left it there.” “And it said?” He looked embarrassed. I continued, “As usual, Inspector, what you tell me about your investigations stays confidential.” That decided him, and he went on. “It said to get together ten thousand dollars in small bills. It seems that City Council Member Linda Amberton has a past. What the letter also said—it’s being dusted for fingerprints now, Crusher, not that I expect any will be found—is that twenty years ago, before she married Martin Amberton, she was really dirt poor. And she had a mother who depended on her. That was, of course, before her mother’s remarriage. So Linda started lifting clothing from stores. This was in her hometown, Riverton.” I nodded. Riverton was fifty miles down the Interstate. “Linda was caught. She got a suspended sentence, and the files were sealed. She was given a job, and paid everthing back. But that’s hardly the typical background for a City Council member. So the letter demands a large sum of money to keep the secret.” “Not that blackmailers ever stop with one demand.” “Of course they don’t. No sense of professional ethics! Naturally, we are discretely staking out the Amberton house, in case there are new communications.” “Who knows about Linda’s past?” “According to her, just her husband, Martin Amberton, in Centerville. She told him about it years ago.” “Who knew about it, back when it happened?” “Dr. Horace Sage gave her the needed job. Dr. Sage is getting on in years, and will be retiring soon. Susan Elliott was the file clerk at the courthouse, but the position is now held by Mary Devers; Mrs. Elliott has retired to Florida. Then there is Susan Royster, an old college friend of Ms. Amberton’s, who helped her settle in here in Centerville, and get a fresh start. Royster even drove her over from Riverton, since Mrs. Amberton didn’t drive then, and doesn’t now.” “Anything about the files being stolen?” “No. They are still sealed. As it happens, old Judge Thornton is still fairly active. He unsealed the records for me, in the interests of justice, and at Linda Amberton’s request. They still bore the same seal—literally—as when the court so ordered, twenty years ago. By the way, Riverton has changed its official seal, and the original one has been destroyed.” “How is the ransom money supposed to be delivered?” “That wasn’t said, oddly enough. My guess is that the next communication will be about delivering the money.” “Can she get it together?” “Yes. Her mother and stepfather left her very well fixed. He had that iron mill that used to employ half the town. A good thing, because the Ambertons have been living on her money for years.” “So you’re really in a waiting mode now?” “Well, yes, but I don’t like a blackmailer calling the shots. That’s where you come in, Crusher. You hear a lot, through that advice column of yours.” “I’m already on it, Inspector. By the way, have you interviewed Sage, Devers and Royster?” “Yes. Frankly, I couldn’t picture any of them sending a blackmail letter, although Dr. Sage and Susan Royster clearly need the money. His retirement money has gone up in smoke, one of Madoff’s victims, he said. And Susan Royster lost her job at the hospital when they had the cutbacks last February.” “Anything else?” “Well … I suppose I’m too old fashioned, for a cop. I didn’t go into details about why I was asking questions.” *** My first interview was with Dr. Sage. He was a wrinkled general practitioner. Yes, he remembered Linda very well; Linda Molton, as she then was. “She remembers you very well, too, Dr. Sage. Says that she owes you a lot, for giving her a job when she really needed it.” “Well, she was a good person and a hard worker. By the way, the interview was cooked in advance. I had had a call, you see, from my old friend and fraternity brother, Judge Thornton. He said she’d been in some trouble; he wasn’t specific, but let me know that it was nothing that a good job and three square meals a day wouldn’t fix. So I hired her.” “Many thanks, Dr. Sage.” Mary Devers knew all about the case—it turns out that her predecessor at the courthouse was gossipy. “That Molton woman really got off lucky. Must have charmed old Judge Thornton, if you ask me!” I wasn’t about to. Susan Royster had a quiet dignity. She talked about Linda Amberton from the old days. I brought up the fact that she had helped Linda settle in Centerville. “So, she shoplifted in a terrible time. So what! I was pleased to help her. Still am,” Susan added, with a vigorous nod of her head. *** The inspector and I met ten days later, when word came from Mr. Amberton that a second blackmail letter had showed up in the Amberton mailbox, one night when our surveillance detective had literally gone to sleep on the job. It demanded that Linda Amberton drive to a secluded location on the southern side of town and leave the money in a flour sack behind a small grove of white birch trees, off the road at the fifteen-mile marker. “Does she really have to do this?” her husband asked. “She put this all behind her a long time ago. I’ll drive her if it’s absolutely necessary, but it isn’t right.” Inspector Samuels started to say something, but my hand on his shoulder stopped him. “That won’t be necessary, Mr. Amberton. We know who the blackmailer is.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Who could know the secret?\n   •  Linda Amberton herself – obviously not a blackmailer of herself.  \n   •  Her husband, Martin Amberton.  \n   •  Dr. Horace Sage – he was told only that she had been “in some trouble”, not exactly that she had shop-lifted.  \n   •  Susan Elliott, the former file clerk – now living in Florida.  \n   •  Mary Devers, the present Riverton file clerk – was told all the details by her gossip-loving predecessor.  \n   •  Susan Royster, Linda’s old college friend.\n\n2.  Who needs money?\n   •  Dr. Sage – retirement savings wiped out.  \n   •  Susan Royster – lost her hospital job.  \n   •  Mary Devers – no mention of hardship but her spiteful remark shows she would gladly profit.\n\n3.  The crucial clue – the second note:\n   It orders LINDA herself to “drive to a secluded spot” with the cash.  \n   Yet the story tells us twice, very plainly, that Linda “doesn’t drive now and didn’t then.”   \n   Anyone who has really known her well (husband Martin or close friend Susan Royster) would never make that mistake.  \n   Someone who met her only casually twenty years ago (Dr. Sage) might also be unaware, but he never learned the precise shoplifting facts that are spelled out in the note.  \n   The only person who (a) knows the exact details of the sealed case and (b) might easily overlook the fact that Linda cannot drive is Mary Devers – the present courthouse clerk who learned the whole story from the previous clerk yet has never had any personal contact with Linda afterward.\n\n4.  Opportunity\n   Devers lives only fifty miles away and, working at a courthouse, can take vacation days or weekends to slip into Centerville.  Both blackmail letters were placed by hand in the Amberton mailbox – exactly what someone arriving by car from out of town would do.\n\n5.  Physical evidence / alibis\n   No fingerprints were expected – a courthouse clerk certainly knows how to keep paper free of prints.  \n   Susan Elliott is hundreds of miles away in Florida; Susan Royster was seen around town job-hunting during the relevant period; Dr. Sage is elderly and walks with a cane (hard to sneak up to a mailbox at night); Martin Amberton had no reason to endanger his wife’s position or his own living.\n\nPutting all this together, only Mary Devers fits every part of the puzzle.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMartin Amberton, Dr. Horace Sage, Susan Royster, Susan Elliott, Mary Devers, Judge Thornton\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMary Devers\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nTwenty years ago the young courthouse file clerk, Susan Elliott, told her junior co-worker, Mary Devers, all the juicy details of Linda Molton’s sealed shop-lifting conviction.  Devers kept the gossip in the back of her mind.\n\nRecently Devers saw in the newspapers and on the Internet that the same Linda (now Linda Amberton) had become a Centerville city-council member and had married into money.  Devers, who disliked “that Molton woman” and fancied an easy windfall, decided to blackmail her.\n\nKnowing the record was still sealed, Devers composed an anonymous letter that recited the offense in detail and threatened exposure.  On a day off she drove to Centerville, slipped the letter directly into the Amberton mailbox (avoiding the postal system and any handwriting analysis of an envelope), and drove back to Riverton.\n\nWhen no money appeared, she wrote a second note, this time demanding that “Linda” drive out to the birch grove at the fifteen-mile marker and leave $10,000 in a flour sack.  Because Devers had never spent real time with Linda, she did not realize Linda cannot drive and therefore betrayed her ignorance.\n\nThe police surveillance man dozed; Devers again drove over after dark and deposited the second note.  Before any exchange could take place, the discrepancy about Linda’s inability to drive let James “Crusher” Davis and Inspector Samuels identify Devers as the only knowledgeable person who could have made that mistake, and she was arrested.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Martin Amberton – Knew his wife cannot drive; would never include such an instruction.  He also gains nothing by endangering the household income on which he depends.  \n•  Dr. Horace Sage – Needs money, but he never knew the exact nature of Linda’s crime; the blackmail letters gave precise details Dr. Sage did not possess.  \n•  Susan Royster – Lost her job and needs cash, yet she certainly knows Linda cannot drive because she chauffeured her for years.  She would not have made that blunder.  \n•  Susan Elliott – Possessed the information but lives in Florida; a mailed letter would have borne a postmark, and she is thousands of miles away from the hand-delivered notes.  \n•  Judge Thornton – Has no financial problems, owes Linda nothing but goodwill, and likewise knows she does not drive.  \nTherefore only Mary Devers matches motive, knowledge, opportunity, and the key mistake that broke the case open.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "correct_answer": "(c) Mary Devers",
    "reveal_text": "Dr. Horace Sage did not know the details of Linda’s problem. He hired her at the request of Judge Thornton. Three people did know the details of her shoplifting conviction. Susan Royster also knew that Linda was unable to drive. Yet the second blackmail letter instructs Linda to drive a considerable distance to deliver the money. Her husband volunteered to drive her to the drop off point, after calling the police and sharing the details of the second letter. Clearly, he is not informing on himself!\nMary Devers slipped badly when she admitted that she knew about Linda’s shoplifting conviction. Had she not done so, the fact that the file had not been unsealed for many years, and was still sealed with the old town seal, would have been a solid defense. But now she is heading for a trial for her attempted blackmail. Since she has perverted her office, Ask Martha predicts that, unlike Linda, Mary’s sentence will not be suspended.",

People nourish their grievances, and then feed on them. That’s why I don’t think the really vicious crimes only happen in the big cities. There’s plenty of material for that right here in Centerville. And I see it, writing for the Chronicle. Actually, you might think the whole Davis clan was working here, from the bylines I get. The business and city hall reporting comes out under my real name, James Harding Davis. For the sports pages, they use my college nickname, Crusher Davis, which used to be pretty accurate on the football field. Not many plays came my way, when the offense got a good look at my build: six foot six and two-hundred-sixty-five pounds. So much for fame in a small town. Nowadays, the Chronicle reporter who gets the most readership is Ask Martha, the advice columnist, and yes, that’s me too … but don’t tell anybody. I didn’t know when I started the column that it would be such a help to the Centerville Police Department. CPD is a pretty fancy term for three people: Inspector Samuels, one deputy, and the City Council member who oversees the police, Linda Amberton. She glories in the title “Chief,” as if she knew anything about crime solving. Well, now she knows a lot more. As a matter of fact, “Chief” Linda Amberton was the one who brought the latest case to Inspector Samuels. She came in quietly—a rarity for her—eased herself into his private office, looked both ways, and then told her story. As Inspector Samuels told me over coffee not long afterward, she told him she had been the victim of a blackmail attempt. “My hat’s off to her,” Samuels said. “Not many people would have the courage to do what she did. Most would just pay up and hope it went away.” “I’m all ears, Inspector. Blackmail sounds like a call, or perhaps a letter, usually anonymous, and always untraceable.” “You’ve got that right, Mar—I mean Crusher. It was a letter that she found in her mailbox. There was no stamp, so it hadn’t gone through the system at all. Someone just left it there.” “And it said?” He looked embarrassed. I continued, “As usual, Inspector, what you tell me about your investigations stays confidential.” That decided him, and he went on. “It said to get together ten thousand dollars in small bills. It seems that City Council Member Linda Amberton has a past. What the letter also said—it’s being dusted for fingerprints now, Crusher, not that I expect any will be found—is that twenty years ago, before she married Martin Amberton, she was really dirt poor. And she had a mother who depended on her. That was, of course, before her mother’s remarriage. So Linda started lifting clothing from stores. This was in her hometown, Riverton.” I nodded. Riverton was fifty miles down the Interstate. “Linda was caught. She got a suspended sentence, and the files were sealed. She was given a job, and paid everthing back. But that’s hardly the typical background for a City Council member. So the letter demands a large sum of money to keep the secret.” “Not that blackmailers ever stop with one demand.” “Of course they don’t. No sense of professional ethics! Naturally, we are discretely staking out the Amberton house, in case there are new communications.” “Who knows about Linda’s past?” “According to her, just her husband, Martin Amberton, in Centerville. She told him about it years ago.” “Who knew about it, back when it happened?” “Dr. Horace Sage gave her the needed job. Dr. Sage is getting on in years, and will be retiring soon. Susan Elliott was the file clerk at the courthouse, but the position is now held by Mary Devers; Mrs. Elliott has retired to Florida. Then there is Susan Royster, an old college friend of Ms. Amberton’s, who helped her settle in here in Centerville, and get a fresh start. Royster even drove her over from Riverton, since Mrs. Amberton didn’t drive then, and doesn’t now.” “Anything about the files being stolen?” “No. They are still sealed. As it happens, old Judge Thornton is still fairly active. He unsealed the records for me, in the interests of justice, and at Linda Amberton’s request. They still bore the same seal—literally—as when the court so ordered, twenty years ago. By the way, Riverton has changed its official seal, and the original one has been destroyed.” “How is the ransom money supposed to be delivered?” “That wasn’t said, oddly enough. My guess is that the next communication will be about delivering the money.” “Can she get it together?” “Yes. Her mother and stepfather left her very well fixed. He had that iron mill that used to employ half the town. A good thing, because the Ambertons have been living on her money for years.” “So you’re really in a waiting mode now?” “Well, yes, but I don’t like a blackmailer calling the shots. That’s where you come in, Crusher. You hear a lot, through that advice column of yours.” “I’m already on it, Inspector. By the way, have you interviewed Sage, Devers and Royster?” “Yes. Frankly, I couldn’t picture any of them sending a blackmail letter, although Dr. Sage and Susan Royster clearly need the money. His retirement money has gone up in smoke, one of Madoff’s victims, he said. And Susan Royster lost her job at the hospital when they had the cutbacks last February.” “Anything else?” “Well … I suppose I’m too old fashioned, for a cop. I didn’t go into details about why I was asking questions.” *** My first interview was with Dr. Sage. He was a wrinkled general practitioner. Yes, he remembered Linda very well; Linda Molton, as she then was. “She remembers you very well, too, Dr. Sage. Says that she owes you a lot, for giving her a job when she really needed it.” “Well, she was a good person and a hard worker. By the way, the interview was cooked in advance. I had had a call, you see, from my old friend and fraternity brother, Judge Thornton. He said she’d been in some trouble; he wasn’t specific, but let me know that it was nothing that a good job and three square meals a day wouldn’t fix. So I hired her.” “Many thanks, Dr. Sage.” Mary Devers knew all about the case—it turns out that her predecessor at the courthouse was gossipy. “That Molton woman really got off lucky. Must have charmed old Judge Thornton, if you ask me!” I wasn’t about to. Susan Royster had a quiet dignity. She talked about Linda Amberton from the old days. I brought up the fact that she had helped Linda settle in Centerville. “So, she shoplifted in a terrible time. So what! I was pleased to help her. Still am,” Susan added, with a vigorous nod of her head. *** The inspector and I met ten days later, when word came from Mr. Amberton that a second blackmail letter had showed up in the Amberton mailbox, one night when our surveillance detective had literally gone to sleep on the job. It demanded that Linda Amberton drive to a secluded location on the southern side of town and leave the money in a flour sack behind a small grove of white birch trees, off the road at the fifteen-mile marker. “Does she really have to do this?” her husband asked. “She put this all behind her a long time ago. I’ll drive her if it’s absolutely necessary, but it isn’t right.” Inspector Samuels started to say something, but my hand on his shoulder stopped him. “That won’t be necessary, Mr. Amberton. We know who the blackmailer is.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Horace Sage; (b) Martin Amberton; (c) Mary Devers; (d) Susan Royster",
      "answer": "(c) Mary Devers",
      "outcome": "Dr. Horace Sage did not know the details of Linda’s problem. He hired her at the request of Judge Thornton. Three people did know the details of her shoplifting conviction. Susan Royster also knew that Linda was unable to drive. Yet the second blackmail letter instructs Linda to drive a considerable distance to deliver the money. Her husband volunteered to drive her to the drop off point, after calling the police and sharing the details of the second letter. Clearly, he is not informing on himself!\nMary Devers slipped badly when she admitted that she knew about Linda’s shoplifting conviction. Had she not done so, the fact that the file had not been unsealed for many years, and was still sealed with the old town seal, would have been a solid defense. But now she is heading for a trial for her attempted blackmail. Since she has perverted her office, Ask Martha predicts that, unlike Linda, Mary’s sentence will not be suspended."
