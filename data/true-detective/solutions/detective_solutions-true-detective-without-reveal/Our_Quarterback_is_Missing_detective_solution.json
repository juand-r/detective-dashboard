    "full_text": "\"Eddie's missing.\" \"How is that even possible? He weighs 240 pounds!\" The classroom laughed at Reggie's joke, but I was worried. Eddie Cavanaugh was the high school's star quarterback. Each week his expert passing led the football team to victory, and no other school in the state had ever won this many games in a row. \"People say jocks are stupid, but Eddie isn't,\" sighed our history teacher. \"He was making our little town famous, and now he's gone.\" Eddie's mother had called the principal's office about one o’clock when she noticed Eddie was missing, and soon everyone in the school was talking about the news. He'd come to school that morning, but then somehow, he'd vanished! As the last school bell rang, I asked Reggie if he wanted to search for Eddie. \"Sure, why not?\" Reggie laughed. \"If we find our missing quarterback, then WE can be the school's heroes.\" But where could we find some clues? The locker room was a good place to start. As we approached, we heard the team shouting enthusiastically \"One! Two! Three! Go!\" as they shuffled out onto the field. Tomorrow they would play an away game in Capitol City - a two-hour drive - so they were getting some extra practice today. We smelled grass and sweaty uniforms, but then we spotted Mr. Roster, the assistant coach, talking on his cellphone. \"Eddie's mother just called me,\" he was saying with exasperation. \"Look, we're doing everything we can.\" His brow furrowed in anger. \"No, we're not canceling the game...\" We waited until the call was done, then asked about Eddie's disappearance. \"You don't realize how important someone is, until they're not around!\" Mr. Roster sighed. \"The team knows it, too. Eddie always led an inspiring cheer after school before each practice. We miss him already.\" Can we search his locker? Reggie asked. The coach looked at us suspiciously, but realized we were trying to help. He led us into his office, where he retrieved a clipboard with all the lockers' combinations. Inside Eddie's we saw his jersey - number 17 - dangling from a hanger. There was nothing unusual in the locker. There were his cleats, his helmet, shoulder pads, kneepads and a sack lunch. But on the door of the locker, we found Eddie's secret motivational tool. He'd drawn a graph for himself, showing various records for high school football. First it showed the school's record for consecutive wins and then the state's and then the record for the entire country. As Coach Roster ran after two players who were arguing, I motioned to Reggie. Coach Roster's office door was open, and we snuck in to search for clues. Reggie opened a filing cabinet and saw manila folders in alphabetical order. He quickly looked for the C's, while I started searching Coach Roster's desk. Its top was filled by a giant desk calendar. I checked yesterday's date, which just said \"Practice,\" like every other day this week. But today's date had an unusual entry, \"Visit Dr. Lazlow, 9 to 11a.m. Capitol City.\" Reggie retrieved a file labeled \"Cavanaugh, Eddie.\" There was a handwritten note. \"Eddie, stop playing, or you'll get hurt, Mae\" it warned. \"What are you doing!\" shouted a voice behind us. Coach Roster had returned and caught Reggie and me by surprise. \"We were looking for clues about Eddie,\" I answered nervously. \"Well, you might as well know,\" sighed Coach Roster wearily. \"That note turned up on the locker room door yesterday. I should've taken it more seriously - but who the heck is 'Mae'?\" Reggie had an idea. \"Eddie's girlfriend is named Marissa! I bet Mae is her nickname.\" Now we had a trail to follow - but where was Marissa? If she was missing too, it might explain Eddie's disappearance. Marissa wasn't a cheerleader, just a hard-working student from a very poor family. Reggie found her family's listing in the phone book, and soon we were traveling to her address. It was a small apartment in a large complex. Marissa's father answered the door, then called out \"Marissa, are you here?\" \"Go away!\" shouted a voice inside. \"Marissa, get out here!\" her father yelled. We waited anxiously, until a bedroom door opened, and we saw our unhappy classmate. Her hair was messy, and her make-up was smeared. It was obvious that she'd been crying. \"What do you want?\" she asked us. We're looking for Eddie, I told her. \"So's half the town,\" she said bitterly. \"Everyone loved Eddie.\" We agreed and couldn't help talking about his popularity. \"It's so unfair,\" Marissa complained. \"Eddie was always so alone. He didn't have a father or even a brother or sister. There is just his mother. And yet this town became his family. He'd made everyone so proud.\" Reggie and I nodded, but Marissa continued, her thoughts far away. \"Eddie said that more than anything he just wanted to get engaged to me some day and settle down as a hero in this very same town. But now he's gone.\" \"Maybe he'll send a message to you, Mae,\" Reggie said, nonchalantly. \"Who's Mae?\" she asked, with irritation. We were running out of clues, but decided to visit Eddie's mother. Her house was a few blocks from Marissa's, and we hoped she wasn't upset when we rang her doorbell. Mrs. Cavanaugh was glad to see friends of Eddie's and quickly invited us in. \"I always worried Eddie would hurt himself,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said. \"All the phone calls I've gotten show what Eddie meant to this town. But I just want my darling boy back.\" Her wall was filled with pictures of Eddie, some in his football uniform, others showing him as a young boy. I asked her when she'd first noticed Eddie was missing. \"I always make him a healthy lunch,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh sighed. \"I leave it on the kitchen counter, since I have to leave for work ten minutes before Eddie leaves for school.\" \"But this afternoon when I came home from work - his sack lunch was still there!\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said with exasperation. \"That's when I realized that Eddie was missing.\" \"We're looking for him,\" Reggie assured her. \"I'm glad to know his friends care about him,\" she smiled. She talked about Marissa and her hopes for her son. \"Come back and visit any time.\" On the sidewalk, Reggie was upset. \"I don't know who could've done this,\" he complained. \"Everyone loved Eddie. In fact, maybe Eddie faked the whole thing himself,\" Reggie said, more serious than I'd ever seen him. \"Being the star quarterback wasn't enough for him. He wanted everyone to worry about him too.\" \"I'm not worried,\" I said, \"because I know where Eddie is. And if you study the clues, you'll know too.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  First I looked for a time-line conflict.  \n    •  Mrs Cavanaugh leaves a packed “healthy sack lunch” on the kitchen counter every day and goes to work ten minutes before Eddie is supposed to leave for school.  \n    •  When she came home that afternoon the lunch was still on the counter, so Eddie never picked it up and therefore never left for school.  \n    •  Yet when Reggie and I opened Eddie’s locker there was a sack-lunch inside it.  That can only be an old, forgotten lunch; Eddie himself was not in school today.\n\n2.  If Eddie never reached school he disappeared between 7:15-7:30 a.m. (after his mother left) and 8:00 a.m. (when school starts).\n\n3.  Who could have met him and taken him away at that hour?  The decisive clue is on the assistant coach’s desk calendar:  \n       “Visit Dr. Lazlow, 9-11 a.m., Capitol City.”  \n    Capitol City is a two-hour drive.  To be in the doctor’s office at 9 a.m. someone had to leave town shortly after 7 a.m.—exactly the moment Eddie was alone at home.\n\n4.  Motive.  \n    •  Yesterday a warning note appeared on the locker-room door:  \n          “Eddie, stop playing or you’ll get hurt.  — Mae”  \n      “Mae” is plainly a mother’s nickname (MAE = Mrs. Cavanaugh’s initials or simply “Ma”).  Eddie’s mother constantly says she worries he will be injured.  \n    •  Coach Roster needs his star quarterback for tomorrow’s game, and at the same time has to prove to Mrs Cavanaugh that Eddie is fit to play.  The only way to satisfy both was to take Eddie, early in the morning, to a specialist in Capitol City for secret tests.\n\n5.  Behaviour.  \n    •  On the practice field the coach sounds exasperated on the telephone to Mrs Cavanaugh but insists “No, we’re not cancelling the game…”—the words of a man who knows where Eddie is and is sure he’ll be back.  \n    •  He is in possession of every locker combination, and could easily have opened Eddie’s locker yesterday to leave equipment exactly as Eddie always keeps it, reinforcing the illusion that Eddie had turned up normally this morning.\n\n6.  Logical conclusion.  \n    Eddie has not been kidnapped; he is undergoing examinations in Dr. Lazlow’s consulting rooms in Capitol City.  \n    The only person with motive, opportunity, means, and knowledge is Assistant Coach Henry Roster.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nHenry Roster, Marissa (Mae) Parker, Mrs. Cavanaugh, Dr. Lazlow, Eddie Cavanaugh himself\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nHenry Roster (Assistant Coach)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nDr. Lazlow (sports physician who is keeping Eddie for tests)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Tuesday evening: Mrs Cavanaugh leaves a warning note (“Mae”) on the locker-room door, begging her son to quit football before he is badly hurt.  \n•  Coach Roster finds the note.  Afraid that Mrs Cavanaugh will forbid Eddie to play, and equally afraid of ruining the team’s record, he secretly makes a 9-11 a.m. appointment for Eddie with sports-medicine specialist Dr. Lazlow in Capitol City.  \n•  Wednesday 7:10 a.m.: As soon as Mrs Cavanaugh drives to work Coach Roster picks Eddie up at his house.  In the hurry Eddie forgets the lunch on the counter.  \n•  9-11 a.m.: Eddie is examined by Dr. Lazlow.  Tests reveal possible injury, so the doctor keeps Eddie for observation.  \n•  Noon: Coach Roster drives straight back to school alone; Eddie remains in Capitol City.  \n•  1:00 p.m.: Mrs Cavanaugh, seeing the untouched lunch, telephones the school.  Because the coach has said nothing, everyone concludes Eddie is “missing.”  \n•  Afternoon: The coach fields frantic telephone calls, refuses to cancel the game, and continues practice, knowing Eddie will be cleared and returned in time.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Marissa “Mae” Parker – She was at home, visibly distraught, and sincerely did not understand the “Mae” signature.  She has no transport and no reason to spirit Eddie two hours away.  \n•  Mrs Cavanaugh – Her entire worry is that Eddie is *missing*.  She rang the school, the coach, and the police.  Nothing indicates she removed her own son.  \n•  Dr. Lazlow – Merely the physician to whom Eddie was taken; no motive beyond medical duty.  \n•  Eddie Cavanaugh – He did not fake a disappearance; he left willingly with his coach for medical tests and has had no contact with friends or family since.  \nThus only Assistant Coach Henry Roster both arranged and executed Eddie’s unexplained removal.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I was telling you a lie. I called Eddie's cellphone when he got to school, and asked him to hurry back home. I just love my son so much. And football is such a dangerous sport. I guess I just wanted to protect him.\"\nWe heard a loud noise in the basement. Running down the stairs, we heard a loud banging coming from behind a locked door. We unlocked the door, and opened it up. And standing inside...was Eddie!\n\"Ma locked me in the TV room this morning!\" Eddie said with a grin. \"I'm sure glad to see you guys!\" Eddie kissed his mother on the cheek, and then headed off to school for the end of practice.\nThe next day the team would win their big game against Capitol City, and continue their record-breaking streak.\nBut the next day for our detective work, we were heroes too.",

Inside Eddie's we saw his jersey - number 17 - dangling from a hanger. There was nothing unusual in the locker. There were his cleats, his helmet, shoulder pads, kneepads and a sack lunch. But on the door of the locker, we found Eddie's secret motivational tool. He'd drawn a graph for himself, showing various records for high school football. First it showed the school's record for consecutive wins and then the state's and then the record for the entire country. As Coach Roster ran after two players who were arguing, I motioned to Reggie. Coach Roster's office door was open, and we snuck in to search for clues. Reggie opened a filing cabinet and saw manila folders in alphabetical order. He quickly looked for the C's, while I started searching Coach Roster's desk. Its top was filled by a giant desk calendar. I checked yesterday's date, which just said \"Practice,\" like every other day this week. But today's date had an unusual entry, \"Visit Dr. Lazlow, 9 to 11a.m. Capitol City.\" Reggie retrieved a file labeled \"Cavanaugh, Eddie.\" There was a handwritten note. \"Eddie, stop playing, or you'll get hurt, Mae\" it warned. \"What are you doing!\" shouted a voice behind us. Coach Roster had returned and caught Reggie and me by surprise. \"We were looking for clues about Eddie,\" I answered nervously. \"Well, you might as well know,\" sighed Coach Roster wearily. \"That note turned up on the locker room door yesterday. I should've taken it more seriously - but who the heck is 'Mae'?\" Reggie had an idea. \"Eddie's girlfriend is named Marissa! I bet Mae is her nickname.\" Now we had a trail to follow - but where was Marissa? If she was missing too, it might explain Eddie's disappearance. Marissa wasn't a cheerleader, just a hard-working student from a very poor family. Reggie found her family's listing in the phone book, and soon we were traveling to her address. It was a small apartment in a large complex. Marissa's father answered the door, then called out \"Marissa, are you here?\" \"Go away!\" shouted a voice inside. \"Marissa, get out here!\" her father yelled. We waited anxiously, until a bedroom door opened, and we saw our unhappy classmate. Her hair was messy, and her make-up was smeared. It was obvious that she'd been crying. \"What do you want?\" she asked us. We're looking for Eddie, I told her. \"So's half the town,\" she said bitterly. \"Everyone loved Eddie.\" We agreed and couldn't help talking about his popularity. \"It's so unfair,\" Marissa complained. \"Eddie was always so alone. He didn't have a father or even a brother or sister. There is just his mother. And yet this town became his family. He'd made everyone so proud.\" Reggie and I nodded, but Marissa continued, her thoughts far away. \"Eddie said that more than anything he just wanted to get engaged to me some day and settle down as a hero in this very same town. But now he's gone.\" \"Maybe he'll send a message to you, Mae,\" Reggie said, nonchalantly. \"Who's Mae?\" she asked, with irritation. We were running out of clues, but decided to visit Eddie's mother. Her house was a few blocks from Marissa's, and we hoped she wasn't upset when we rang her doorbell. Mrs. Cavanaugh was glad to see friends of Eddie's and quickly invited us in. \"I always worried Eddie would hurt himself,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said. \"All the phone calls I've gotten show what Eddie meant to this town. But I just want my darling boy back.\" Her wall was filled with pictures of Eddie, some in his football uniform, others showing him as a young boy. I asked her when she'd first noticed Eddie was missing. \"I always make him a healthy lunch,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh sighed. \"I leave it on the kitchen counter, since I have to leave for work ten minutes before Eddie leaves for school.\" \"But this afternoon when I came home from work - his sack lunch was still there!\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said with exasperation. \"That's when I realized that Eddie was missing.\" \"We're looking for him,\" Reggie assured her. \"I'm glad to know his friends care about him,\" she smiled. She talked about Marissa and her hopes for her son. \"Come back and visit any time.\" On the sidewalk, Reggie was upset. \"I don't know who could've done this,\" he complained. \"Everyone loved Eddie. In fact, maybe Eddie faked the whole thing himself,\" Reggie said, more serious than I'd ever seen him. \"Being the star quarterback wasn't enough for him. He wanted everyone to worry about him too.\" \"I'm not worried,\" I said, \"because I know where Eddie is. And if you study the clues, you'll know too.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Coach Roster; (b) Eddie; (c) Eddie's Mom; (d) Marissa",
      "answer": "(c) Eddie's Mom",
      "outcome": "\"Eddie wouldn't fake his own disappearance,\" I assured Reggie. \"Remember that graph in his locker? Even in private, Eddie proudly tracked the records he was breaking.\"\nReggie thought for a moment. \"And we saw his attendance chart in Coach Roster's office. He'd never even missed a practice before.\"\n\"Coach Roster seemed like a likely suspect,\" I pointed out. \"But he'd had a 9 a.m. appointment in Capitol City this morning. That's two hours away! He couldn't drive there, drive back, and then somehow kidnap Eddie before he'd left for school.\"\n\"But someone left that note on the locker room door!\"\n\"And it wasn't Marissa,\" I said. \"She seemed genuinely upset at Eddie's disappearance. And it's obvious no one ever called her 'Mae' before.\"\n\"But then who's Mae?\" Reggie asked.\n\"Come on,\" I told Reggie, leading him back to Mrs. Cavanaugh's house.\n\"Is your name Mae?\" Reggie blurted out as soon as she answered the door.\n\"Why yes,\" she said, smiling graciously.\n\"We saw Eddie's sack lunch in his locker,\" I said. \"So it's obvious he didn't leave it on your counter this morning.\"\nMrs. Cavanaugh stared back at us silently, then said \"You're right. I was telling you a lie. I called Eddie's cellphone when he got to school, and asked him to hurry back home. I just love my son so much. And football is such a dangerous sport. I guess I just wanted to protect him.\"\nWe heard a loud noise in the basement. Running down the stairs, we heard a loud banging coming from behind a locked door. We unlocked the door, and opened it up. And standing inside...was Eddie!\n\"Ma locked me in the TV room this morning!\" Eddie said with a grin. \"I'm sure glad to see you guys!\" Eddie kissed his mother on the cheek, and then headed off to school for the end of practice.\nThe next day the team would win their big game against Capitol City, and continue their record-breaking streak.\nBut the next day for our detective work, we were heroes too."
