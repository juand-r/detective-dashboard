    "full_text": "A small high school stood adjacent to a much larger hill, which effectively blocked out the sun so that shadows engulfed the building. The absence of activity on the outside of the building—as classes were in session—combined with the darkness made for a very dreary atmosphere. The feeling became even more prevalent as soon as one stepped inside Mrs. Adam’s English III classroom, Room 106. In the room, Mrs. Adam sat struggling to keep her weary eyes on Jane Landau, whose grievance had been the center of the aging teacher’s reluctant attention for all of the first ten minutes of her planning period. Jane Landau, whose incessant complaints were enabled by the fact she had a free period, was practically jumping as she went through the details of what she described as a tragedy for the fourth time. “It was near the end of second block when I asked to go to the bathroom,” started Jane again. “I didn’t think to bring my iPod—I never do. I didn’t think anyone, out of the thousands of times I’ve left at my desk, would take it this one time! Know what I mean?” Her teacher could only nod begrudgingly. “I don’t think anyone could have taken it by accident. It has my name on the back and a lot of stickers on it—no one could have mistaken it for his or her own. “Since I left so late in class, by the time I got back the bell had already rung, so there was no one to ask about it when it turned up missing,” continued Jane. “Well, do you remember who was sitting around you?” Mrs. Adam asked, almost mumbling. “Let me think,” Jane responded, pursing her lips and scratching the top of her head. “That really shy, depressing girl Shay Dulaney was sitting right behind me.” After a moment’s pause, she began to list off other classmates. “That Shawn Ramos kid was sitting beside Shay. It wouldn’t surprise me if he stole it. He’s been caught for stealing a lot. Next time he steals he’s supposed to be expelled.” “Oh, wouldn’t that be a shame,” said Mrs. Adam, who was only about half present in the conversation. “Lea Thompson was sitting in front of Shawn, I think. I remember she was complaining about something to Rachel Vermeer, who was sitting in front of her. I don’t know what they were talking about, though. But when I looked back to ask Shay for a pencil, I noticed that she was watching them. Maybe you should ask her some questions—it could be important.” “I’ll do that,” said Mrs. Adam, hardly aware of what she was agreeing to. “For now, I think you should work on homework in the library.” “Sure thing,” Jane said, having sufficiently aired her complaints. “Though it would be nice if I could listen to music while I did it.” With clumsy movements, Mrs. Adam called down to the office, and moments later Shay Dulaney was instructed to go to Room 106 by a voice over the intercom. She arrived, looking almost as tired as the teacher. She wore a baggy gray sweatshirt, which seemed to make more obvious the unusual paleness of her skin, afflicted with a series of pimples. “You wanted to see me?” she asked in a dull voice. “Right, Shay,” began Mrs. Adam, whose voice seemed to challenge Shay’s in a battle of dullness. “Jane Landau’s iPod went missing during second block. She said you were sitting behind her and watched a discussion between Rachel Vermeer and Lea Thompson. Could you tell me what they were talking about?” “Yeah, sure,” Shay said, clearly bored. “From what I heard, Rachel was angry about something her dad said. She seems kinda spoiled, you know? I never heard the end of the conversation, though. I turned on my own iPod and read for the last few minutes of class, after Jane left. I didn’t notice anything after that.” “Fair enough,” said Mrs. Adam. “You may go.” As she digested this information, she called the office once more, this time to have them send up Shawn Ramos. After the third attempt at reaching the boy—which ran into the second half of Mrs. Adam’s planning period—he slouched into the classroom, glaring at his teacher. “Shawn, nice to see you,” said Mrs. Adam, forcing a smile. He only shrugged. “I heard you were sitting close to Ms. Landau during second block. She had her iPod stolen near the end of class, and I just wanted to know if you have any details about that.” “It wasn’t me,” he said darkly. “I can’t afford another slip-up—I’ll get expelled if I break the rules again.” “Well, are there any details about anyone else sitting close to Jane you can share with me?” Mrs. Adams asked. “I didn’t really notice much during the end of class. I was too distracted by Rachel Vermeer whining about something to Lea Thompson. It was annoying. Lea must have thought so too, because she looked relieved when she got called down to the office a few minutes before class ended.” “I see,” said Mrs. Adams. Without any other questions to ask the boy, she dismissed him. Next she called for Lea Thompson, though fortune seemed to be on her side, for walking in to Room 106 alongside Ms. Thompson was Rachel Vermeer, with her purse held tightly against her side. “Hello girls,” said Mrs. Adams. “I wanted to ask you both some questions about an iPod that was stolen near the end of second block.” Neither of them seemed daunted by this. “I wasn’t here at the end of that class,” said the visibly annoyed Lea. “I was called down to the office to talk to my swim coach. I couldn’t have stolen the iPod.” “Yeah, I couldn’t have taken Jane’s iPod, either. I was too busy working, since there was no one to talk to after Lea left,” added Rachel. “I see,” said Mrs. Adam. “Both of you sit down,” she instructed, reaching for the phone.” “What are you doing?” Rachel asked. “Having the office call Jane Vermeer. It’s fortunate that she doesn’t have her iPod now—she’ll be able to better listen to my findings.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tFirst list every pupil who was close enough to Jane’s desk to take the i-Pod:\n     –  Shay Dulaney (directly behind Jane)  \n     –  Shawn Ramos  (diagonally behind)  \n     –  Lea Thompson (two seats ahead, would have to turn round)  \n     –  Rachel Vermeer (in front of Lea, still within two or three steps)\n2.\tCheck for motive.  \n     •  Shay already owns an i-Pod and even used it in the same period – no need to steal another.  \n     •  Shawn has a record for theft, but another offence means automatic expulsion; that is a powerful\n        deterrent.  \n     •  Lea is focussed on swimming; no hint she even wants an i-Pod.  \n     •  Rachel is described as “spoiled” and is furious at her father about something – a plausible reason\n        to grab what she wants.\n3.\tAnalyse opportunity and testimony for contradictions.  \n     •  Shay says she put her ear-buds in “after Jane left” and read.  With music playing she could\n        neither follow nor take part in the conversation; that fits what everyone else saw.  \n     •  Lea really did leave a few minutes before the bell; the teacher can check the office slip, and\n        both Shay and Shawn confirm she was called out.  If she had walked back toward Jane’s desk to\n        steal, Shay (who was watching her) would have noticed – but she didn’t.  \n     •  Shawn’s story (Rachel kept whining right up to the end of class) clashes with Rachel’s story\n        (“I was too busy working since there was no one to talk to after Lea left”).  Both cannot be\n        true.  Thus Rachel is lying about what she was doing after Lea went out.  A lie is only needed\n        if she was doing something she should not – namely walking to Jane’s vacant desk.  \n4.\tLook for physical clues.  When Rachel enters Mrs Adam’s room she is “holding her purse tightly\n     against her side” – behaviour typical of someone concealing an object.\n5.\tPut the time line together.  Jane leaves – Rachel sees the unattended, sticker-covered i-Pod – she\n     waits until Lea is called out (fewer witnesses) – walks the two steps back, pockets the i-Pod,\n     returns to her seat and pretends to “work” until the bell – then stuffs it in her purse and keeps\n     the purse clamped shut while she’s questioned.\n6.\tNo other testimony is inconsistent except Rachel’s; motive, opportunity and the physical clue all\n     point to her.  Therefore Rachel Vermeer is the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nShay Dulaney, Shawn Ramos, Lea Thompson, Rachel Vermeer\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nRachel Vermeer\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Near the end of second block Jane asks to use the restroom, leaving her distinctive,\n  sticker-covered i-Pod on the desk.  \n• Shay and Shawn are listening to Rachel gripe at Lea.  \n• The office calls Lea to speak with her swim-coach; she gathers her things and leaves.\n  Only Shay, Shawn and Rachel remain near Jane’s desk.  \n• Seeing that the seat next to her is now un-watched and that Jane’s i-Pod is still lying\n  there, Rachel steps back, slips it into her purse and returns to her place.  \n• Shay has her ear-buds in and her head in a book, Shawn is still half-listening to\n  Rachel’s complaints, so neither notices the quick theft.  \n• The bell rings, everyone hurries out, and Jane discovers the loss when she returns.  \n• Rachel keeps the i-Pod hidden in her purse, which she instinctively presses against her\n  side when she is summoned by Mrs Adam.  \n• While being questioned she lies, claiming she was “working” after Lea left; Shawn’s\n  statement proves that conversation (and therefore Rachel’s movement) continued,\n  exposing the lie and confirming her guilt.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nShay Dulaney – Already had her own i-Pod playing, so had no motive; with ear-phones in she did not\nnotice anything after Jane left, but there is no evidence she left her seat.\n\nShawn Ramos – Would face automatic expulsion if caught stealing again; he watched the front of the\nroom and could describe what Rachel was doing, showing he did not approach Jane’s desk himself.\n\nLea Thompson – Documented call to the office removed her from the room several minutes before the\nbell.  Both Shay and Shawn confirm she went straight out; Shay, who was looking in that direction,\ndid not see her approach Jane’s desk.\n\nThus only Rachel Vermeer had the motive, the uninterrupted opportunity, lied about her actions, and\nwas found clutching a purse large enough to hide the missing i-Pod.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "“Jane, I have figured out who stole your iPod.” Mrs. Adam told her student. “Since you weren’t here at the end of class, you wouldn’t know the status of all the students. Let me fill you in on the details:\n“Shay Dulaney said that Rachel was complaining about her dad to Lea, who Shawn Ramos revealed had been called down to the office before the bell rang. While this still left three possible culprits, Mr. Ramos, I decided, couldn’t have stolen the iPod, due to his fear of being expelled should he break the rules again. And Ms. Ramos mentioned using an iPod of her own at the end of class—she wouldn’t have used your iPod without first taking it home to peel off all your stickers.”\nMrs. Adam paused a moment, to be sure that all three pairs of eyes were fixated on her. Satisfied with her observations, she delved into the final solution. “When I asked Rachel and Lea what they knew about the theft, they both claimed to have not stolen the iPod. But the difference between their stories is that Rachel said she hadn’t stolen it from you, Jane, when I never said it was your iPod that was taken. May I see your purse, Rachel?”\nThe defeated looking teenager handed over her bag. After a minute of rummaging through seemingly endless odds and ends, Mrs. Adam’s effort revealed an iPod, adorned with various stickers and the name “Jane Landau” on the back.\n“You don’t understand!” exclaimed Rachel, irate. “Everyone else has an iPod—why shouldn’t my father buy me one? I get straight A’s, don’t get into trouble, and do plenty of chores for him, but he never gets me anything I want!”\n“I’m afraid that doesn’t change anything. You’ll have to go down to the principal’s office.” As she stomped to the door, Mrs. Adam called back to her once more, “Oh, and Rachel?”\nRachel looked back.\n“iPods aren’t allowed in detention, anyways.”\nHer face went red before she stormed out of the room. Satisfied, Mrs. Adam dismissed Jane and Lea, having given Ms. Landau back her iPod. With a heavy sigh, the teacher took a long draw from her coffee mug, and leaned back in her chair to enjoy the rest of her planning period. A moment later, the bell rang. “Drat,” she said.",

Next she called for Lea Thompson, though fortune seemed to be on her side, for walking in to Room 106 alongside Ms. Thompson was Rachel Vermeer, with her purse held tightly against her side. “Hello girls,” said Mrs. Adams. “I wanted to ask you both some questions about an iPod that was stolen near the end of second block.” Neither of them seemed daunted by this. “I wasn’t here at the end of that class,” said the visibly annoyed Lea. “I was called down to the office to talk to my swim coach. I couldn’t have stolen the iPod.” “Yeah, I couldn’t have taken Jane’s iPod, either. I was too busy working, since there was no one to talk to after Lea left,” added Rachel. “I see,” said Mrs. Adam. “Both of you sit down,” she instructed, reaching for the phone.” “What are you doing?” Rachel asked. “Having the office call Jane Vermeer. It’s fortunate that she doesn’t have her iPod now—she’ll be able to better listen to my findings.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Lea Thompson; (b) Rachel Vermeer; (c) Shawn Ramos; (d) Shay Dulaney",
      "answer": "(b) Rachel Vermeer",
      "outcome": "“Jane, I have figured out who stole your iPod.” Mrs. Adam told her student. “Since you weren’t here at the end of class, you wouldn’t know the status of all the students. Let me fill you in on the details:\n“Shay Dulaney said that Rachel was complaining about her dad to Lea, who Shawn Ramos revealed had been called down to the office before the bell rang. While this still left three possible culprits, Mr. Ramos, I decided, couldn’t have stolen the iPod, due to his fear of being expelled should he break the rules again. And Ms. Ramos mentioned using an iPod of her own at the end of class—she wouldn’t have used your iPod without first taking it home to peel off all your stickers.”\nMrs. Adam paused a moment, to be sure that all three pairs of eyes were fixated on her. Satisfied with her observations, she delved into the final solution. “When I asked Rachel and Lea what they knew about the theft, they both claimed to have not stolen the iPod. But the difference between their stories is that Rachel said she hadn’t stolen it from you, Jane, when I never said it was your iPod that was taken. May I see your purse, Rachel?”\nThe defeated looking teenager handed over her bag. After a minute of rummaging through seemingly endless odds and ends, Mrs. Adam’s effort revealed an iPod, adorned with various stickers and the name “Jane Landau” on the back.\n“You don’t understand!” exclaimed Rachel, irate. “Everyone else has an iPod—why shouldn’t my father buy me one? I get straight A’s, don’t get into trouble, and do plenty of chores for him, but he never gets me anything I want!”\n“I’m afraid that doesn’t change anything. You’ll have to go down to the principal’s office.” As she stomped to the door, Mrs. Adam called back to her once more, “Oh, and Rachel?”\nRachel looked back.\n“iPods aren’t allowed in detention, anyways.”\nHer face went red before she stormed out of the room. Satisfied, Mrs. Adam dismissed Jane and Lea, having given Ms. Landau back her iPod. With a heavy sigh, the teacher took a long draw from her coffee mug, and leaned back in her chair to enjoy the rest of her planning period. A moment later, the bell rang. “Drat,” she said."
