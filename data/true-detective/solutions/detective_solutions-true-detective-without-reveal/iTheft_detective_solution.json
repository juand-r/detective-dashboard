    "full_text": "A small high school stood adjacent to a much larger hill, which effectively blocked out the sun so that shadows engulfed the building. The absence of activity on the outside of the building—as classes were in session—combined with the darkness made for a very dreary atmosphere. The feeling became even more prevalent as soon as one stepped inside Mrs. Adam’s English III classroom, Room 106. In the room, Mrs. Adam sat struggling to keep her weary eyes on Jane Landau, whose grievance had been the center of the aging teacher’s reluctant attention for all of the first ten minutes of her planning period. Jane Landau, whose incessant complaints were enabled by the fact she had a free period, was practically jumping as she went through the details of what she described as a tragedy for the fourth time. “It was near the end of second block when I asked to go to the bathroom,” started Jane again. “I didn’t think to bring my iPod—I never do. I didn’t think anyone, out of the thousands of times I’ve left at my desk, would take it this one time! Know what I mean?” Her teacher could only nod begrudgingly. “I don’t think anyone could have taken it by accident. It has my name on the back and a lot of stickers on it—no one could have mistaken it for his or her own. “Since I left so late in class, by the time I got back the bell had already rung, so there was no one to ask about it when it turned up missing,” continued Jane. “Well, do you remember who was sitting around you?” Mrs. Adam asked, almost mumbling. “Let me think,” Jane responded, pursing her lips and scratching the top of her head. “That really shy, depressing girl Shay Dulaney was sitting right behind me.” After a moment’s pause, she began to list off other classmates. “That Shawn Ramos kid was sitting beside Shay. It wouldn’t surprise me if he stole it. He’s been caught for stealing a lot. Next time he steals he’s supposed to be expelled.” “Oh, wouldn’t that be a shame,” said Mrs. Adam, who was only about half present in the conversation. “Lea Thompson was sitting in front of Shawn, I think. I remember she was complaining about something to Rachel Vermeer, who was sitting in front of her. I don’t know what they were talking about, though. But when I looked back to ask Shay for a pencil, I noticed that she was watching them. Maybe you should ask her some questions—it could be important.” “I’ll do that,” said Mrs. Adam, hardly aware of what she was agreeing to. “For now, I think you should work on homework in the library.” “Sure thing,” Jane said, having sufficiently aired her complaints. “Though it would be nice if I could listen to music while I did it.” With clumsy movements, Mrs. Adam called down to the office, and moments later Shay Dulaney was instructed to go to Room 106 by a voice over the intercom. She arrived, looking almost as tired as the teacher. She wore a baggy gray sweatshirt, which seemed to make more obvious the unusual paleness of her skin, afflicted with a series of pimples. “You wanted to see me?” she asked in a dull voice. “Right, Shay,” began Mrs. Adam, whose voice seemed to challenge Shay’s in a battle of dullness. “Jane Landau’s iPod went missing during second block. She said you were sitting behind her and watched a discussion between Rachel Vermeer and Lea Thompson. Could you tell me what they were talking about?” “Yeah, sure,” Shay said, clearly bored. “From what I heard, Rachel was angry about something her dad said. She seems kinda spoiled, you know? I never heard the end of the conversation, though. I turned on my own iPod and read for the last few minutes of class, after Jane left. I didn’t notice anything after that.” “Fair enough,” said Mrs. Adam. “You may go.” As she digested this information, she called the office once more, this time to have them send up Shawn Ramos. After the third attempt at reaching the boy—which ran into the second half of Mrs. Adam’s planning period—he slouched into the classroom, glaring at his teacher. “Shawn, nice to see you,” said Mrs. Adam, forcing a smile. He only shrugged. “I heard you were sitting close to Ms. Landau during second block. She had her iPod stolen near the end of class, and I just wanted to know if you have any details about that.” “It wasn’t me,” he said darkly. “I can’t afford another slip-up—I’ll get expelled if I break the rules again.” “Well, are there any details about anyone else sitting close to Jane you can share with me?” Mrs. Adams asked. “I didn’t really notice much during the end of class. I was too distracted by Rachel Vermeer whining about something to Lea Thompson. It was annoying. Lea must have thought so too, because she looked relieved when she got called down to the office a few minutes before class ended.” “I see,” said Mrs. Adams. Without any other questions to ask the boy, she dismissed him. Next she called for Lea Thompson, though fortune seemed to be on her side, for walking in to Room 106 alongside Ms. Thompson was Rachel Vermeer, with her purse held tightly against her side. “Hello girls,” said Mrs. Adams. “I wanted to ask you both some questions about an iPod that was stolen near the end of second block.” Neither of them seemed daunted by this. “I wasn’t here at the end of that class,” said the visibly annoyed Lea. “I was called down to the office to talk to my swim coach. I couldn’t have stolen the iPod.” “Yeah, I couldn’t have taken Jane’s iPod, either. I was too busy working, since there was no one to talk to after Lea left,” added Rachel. “I see,” said Mrs. Adam. “Both of you sit down,” she instructed, reaching for the phone.” “What are you doing?” Rachel asked. “Having the office call Jane Vermeer. It’s fortunate that she doesn’t have her iPod now—she’ll be able to better listen to my findings.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Fix the moment of the crime  \n   • The iPod disappeared after Jane left for the bathroom and before the dismissal-bell rang.  \n   • During that three-to-four-minute span everybody was still in the room except the teacher (working at her desk) and, a little later, Lea (who was called to the office).\n\n2. Who could physically take the player without being seen?  \n   a) Shay – sits directly behind Jane: easiest reach, but she would have had to raise her arm in full view of Shawn (beside her) and of the two girls in front.  \n   b) Shawn – one seat diagonally behind Jane: also close, but every witness describes him as facing forward, bothered by the quarrel in front.  \n   c) Lea – two rows in front of Jane: she would have to walk back past Shawn, Shay and the teacher, pick up the iPod, then leave for the office call. Hard to do unnoticed.  \n   d) Rachel – directly in front of Lea, therefore three rows in front of Jane. To reach Jane she would have to turn round, stand and walk back only AFTER Lea had gone (when no-one was talking to her and the two “back-row” students were busy with music or irritation). That is possible and, crucially, gives her a place to hide the player – her handbag.\n\n3. What do the statements reveal?  \n   • Shay says that after Jane left she “turned on my own iPod and read” – i.e. she stopped watching the room and put in ear-buds.  \n   • Shawn says he was “too distracted by Rachel whining … until Lea was called”. He therefore admits that once Lea left he was no longer paying attention to Rachel.  \n   • Rachel claims that once Lea left “I was too busy working, since there was no one to talk to”. That leaves her completely unobserved for the minute before the bell.  \n   • Rachel turns up in Mrs. Adam’s room un-summoned, clutching her purse “tightly against her side” – classic behaviour of someone guarding incriminating property.  \n   • Mrs. Adam deliberately mixes the victim’s first name with Rachel’s surname (“Jane Vermeer”). This reveals the conclusion she has just reached – Jane’s iPod is now in Vermeer’s possession.\n\n4. Motive  \n   Rachel had been “angry about something her dad said” and, by everyone’s account, is spoiled and prone to tantrums. Taking another girl’s iPod fits both the anger and the spoiled-child profile. Shawn’s motive (desperation) is offset by the risk of expulsion, and neither Shay nor Lea is given any motive at all.\n\n5. Logical chain  \n   • Only one person is positively in possession of a capacious hiding place (a purse).  \n   • Only one person appears in the office clutching something that could contain the iPod.  \n   • Only one person places herself deliberately on the scene of the inquiry without being asked.  \n   • The teacher’s slip, “Jane Vermeer”, fuses the victim and that one person.  \n   → Therefore Rachel Vermeer stole the iPod.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nShay Dulaney, Shawn Ramos, Lea Thompson, Rachel Vermeer\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nRachel Vermeer\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Near the end of second block, Jane Landau leaves the room for the bathroom, leaving her sticker-covered iPod on her desk.  \n2. The room layout is such that Rachel (row 1), Lea (row 2), Shawn (row 3) and Shay (row 4) are all between Jane’s empty seat and the teacher’s desk.  \n3. While Jane is gone, Shay plugs in her own ear-buds and begins reading; Shawn sits staring forward, irritated; Lea continues arguing with Rachel.  \n4. The office calls for Lea Thompson. Relieved, Lea picks up her things and walks out.  \n5. With her conversation partner gone and the rear-row students occupied, Rachel stands, walks two rows back, slips Jane’s iPod into her purse, and returns to her seat.  \n6. The bell rings. Jane comes back, discovers the loss, and reports it to Mrs. Adam.  \n7. During the informal investigation Rachel, afraid Lea might mention the argument and the timing of the office call, accompanies Lea to Mrs. Adam’s room, hugging her purse to her body.  \n8. Mrs. Adam notices the purse, the unnecessary arrival, and the contradictions in the witnesses’ stories; she realises the iPod must now be in “Jane Vermeer’s” possession—i.e., in Rachel’s purse.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nShay Dulaney – Although she sat directly behind Jane, turning on her own iPod immediately after Jane left meant she would have been seen (or at least heard rustling) if she had leaned forward; moreover, she had nowhere obvious to hide another iPod in the thin sweatshirt, and Mrs. Adam found nothing odd in her manner.\n\nShawn Ramos – He was diagonally behind Jane, but his attention was on the noisy quarrel in front of him; any movement he made toward Jane’s desk would have been visible to Shay. His fear of expulsion also argues against taking such an obvious risk.\n\nLea Thompson – She was called to the office before the bell and left the room in full view of everyone. To have taken the iPod she would have had to walk back toward Jane’s seat past the others and the teacher, which no one reports seeing. Nothing in her statement or behaviour suggests she is hiding anything.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "“Jane, I have figured out who stole your iPod.” Mrs. Adam told her student. “Since you weren’t here at the end of class, you wouldn’t know the status of all the students. Let me fill you in on the details:\n“Shay Dulaney said that Rachel was complaining about her dad to Lea, who Shawn Ramos revealed had been called down to the office before the bell rang. While this still left three possible culprits, Mr. Ramos, I decided, couldn’t have stolen the iPod, due to his fear of being expelled should he break the rules again. And Ms. Ramos mentioned using an iPod of her own at the end of class—she wouldn’t have used your iPod without first taking it home to peel off all your stickers.”\nMrs. Adam paused a moment, to be sure that all three pairs of eyes were fixated on her. Satisfied with her observations, she delved into the final solution. “When I asked Rachel and Lea what they knew about the theft, they both claimed to have not stolen the iPod. But the difference between their stories is that Rachel said she hadn’t stolen it from you, Jane, when I never said it was your iPod that was taken. May I see your purse, Rachel?”\nThe defeated looking teenager handed over her bag. After a minute of rummaging through seemingly endless odds and ends, Mrs. Adam’s effort revealed an iPod, adorned with various stickers and the name “Jane Landau” on the back.\n“You don’t understand!” exclaimed Rachel, irate. “Everyone else has an iPod—why shouldn’t my father buy me one? I get straight A’s, don’t get into trouble, and do plenty of chores for him, but he never gets me anything I want!”\n“I’m afraid that doesn’t change anything. You’ll have to go down to the principal’s office.” As she stomped to the door, Mrs. Adam called back to her once more, “Oh, and Rachel?”\nRachel looked back.\n“iPods aren’t allowed in detention, anyways.”\nHer face went red before she stormed out of the room. Satisfied, Mrs. Adam dismissed Jane and Lea, having given Ms. Landau back her iPod. With a heavy sigh, the teacher took a long draw from her coffee mug, and leaned back in her chair to enjoy the rest of her planning period. A moment later, the bell rang. “Drat,” she said.",

She had her iPod stolen near the end of class, and I just wanted to know if you have any details about that.” “It wasn’t me,” he said darkly. “I can’t afford another slip-up—I’ll get expelled if I break the rules again.” “Well, are there any details about anyone else sitting close to Jane you can share with me?” Mrs. Adams asked. “I didn’t really notice much during the end of class. I was too distracted by Rachel Vermeer whining about something to Lea Thompson. It was annoying. Lea must have thought so too, because she looked relieved when she got called down to the office a few minutes before class ended.” “I see,” said Mrs. Adams. Without any other questions to ask the boy, she dismissed him. Next she called for Lea Thompson, though fortune seemed to be on her side, for walking in to Room 106 alongside Ms. Thompson was Rachel Vermeer, with her purse held tightly against her side. “Hello girls,” said Mrs. Adams. “I wanted to ask you both some questions about an iPod that was stolen near the end of second block.” Neither of them seemed daunted by this. “I wasn’t here at the end of that class,” said the visibly annoyed Lea. “I was called down to the office to talk to my swim coach. I couldn’t have stolen the iPod.” “Yeah, I couldn’t have taken Jane’s iPod, either. I was too busy working, since there was no one to talk to after Lea left,” added Rachel. “I see,” said Mrs. Adam. “Both of you sit down,” she instructed, reaching for the phone.” “What are you doing?” Rachel asked. “Having the office call Jane Vermeer. It’s fortunate that she doesn’t have her iPod now—she’ll be able to better listen to my findings.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Lea Thompson; (b) Rachel Vermeer; (c) Shawn Ramos; (d) Shay Dulaney",
      "answer": "(b) Rachel Vermeer",
      "outcome": "“Jane, I have figured out who stole your iPod.” Mrs. Adam told her student. “Since you weren’t here at the end of class, you wouldn’t know the status of all the students. Let me fill you in on the details:\n“Shay Dulaney said that Rachel was complaining about her dad to Lea, who Shawn Ramos revealed had been called down to the office before the bell rang. While this still left three possible culprits, Mr. Ramos, I decided, couldn’t have stolen the iPod, due to his fear of being expelled should he break the rules again. And Ms. Ramos mentioned using an iPod of her own at the end of class—she wouldn’t have used your iPod without first taking it home to peel off all your stickers.”\nMrs. Adam paused a moment, to be sure that all three pairs of eyes were fixated on her. Satisfied with her observations, she delved into the final solution. “When I asked Rachel and Lea what they knew about the theft, they both claimed to have not stolen the iPod. But the difference between their stories is that Rachel said she hadn’t stolen it from you, Jane, when I never said it was your iPod that was taken. May I see your purse, Rachel?”\nThe defeated looking teenager handed over her bag. After a minute of rummaging through seemingly endless odds and ends, Mrs. Adam’s effort revealed an iPod, adorned with various stickers and the name “Jane Landau” on the back.\n“You don’t understand!” exclaimed Rachel, irate. “Everyone else has an iPod—why shouldn’t my father buy me one? I get straight A’s, don’t get into trouble, and do plenty of chores for him, but he never gets me anything I want!”\n“I’m afraid that doesn’t change anything. You’ll have to go down to the principal’s office.” As she stomped to the door, Mrs. Adam called back to her once more, “Oh, and Rachel?”\nRachel looked back.\n“iPods aren’t allowed in detention, anyways.”\nHer face went red before she stormed out of the room. Satisfied, Mrs. Adam dismissed Jane and Lea, having given Ms. Landau back her iPod. With a heavy sigh, the teacher took a long draw from her coffee mug, and leaned back in her chair to enjoy the rest of her planning period. A moment later, the bell rang. “Drat,” she said."
