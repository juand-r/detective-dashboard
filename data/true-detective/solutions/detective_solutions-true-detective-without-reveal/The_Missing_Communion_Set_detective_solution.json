    "full_text": "Janice Cummings was excited. As the youth director for a new church in Overland Park, Kansas, she would host the church’s first youth sleep over. The little church had been open for six months, and still, the membership was less than 100. Though for the first time, Janice felt the church was coming together as a viable congregation. This pleased her, as the Christmas season was less than a month away. The congregation had purchased an old church building on the outskirts of Overland Park. The building was constructed in the 1930s and very old fashioned by modern standards. An old cemetery behind the churchyard reminded Janice that this institution was from a different time and way of life. The building itself was square-shaped, consisting of the sanctuary with rooms and offices on either side. A small kitchen was tucked away in back of the choir area. And that was it. Tonight, Janice would supervise the youth sleep over. There would be five kids in attendance. Janelle, Heather and Allison would sleep in a classroom on the right side of the sanctuary. Justin and Josh would sleep in a different classroom, across on the left side. Janice would sleep on the couch in the pastor’s office, which was also on the left side of the sanctuary. She knew better, though, than to believe anyone would be sleeping much. Janelle Herbst, 18, was the oldest of the girls. Janelle wore a walking cast on a very painful broken ankle and could barely walk. She was in obvious pain but was determined to spend the night with her friends. Heather Guse, a serious and intense girl, was a year younger and hoped to enroll in seminary next year after graduating from high school. Heather’s lifelong dream was to follow her dad into ministry. Her father was an ordained minister and a friend of Janice’s boss, Pastor Brian Huseby. Justin Paul, 13, was the newest youth member. He seemed nervous, but Janice assumed it was because he didn’t know the older youth and, perhaps, he did not feel well. Justin had undergone sinus surgery recently and experienced discomfort in breathing. Josh Darvin, 15, was a quiet boy who never said much, though he could be rambunctious and was liked by the other kids. Allison, 17, was the mischievous one. Janice made a mental note to keep a close eye on her. At 6:00 p.m., Pastor Brian served communion in the sanctuary. The silver wine chalice and bread tray were the first gifts the new congregation had received and Pastor Brian was fiercely proud of them. They were on permanent display by the speaker’s podium. Communion was served by the intinction method – in which the sacraments are served by dipping the wafer or bread in the communal wine cup. During communion, Janice noticed that Justin had not removed his heavy coat, which was quite baggy on his thin frame. Janice and the kids prepared a snack supper at 7:00 p.m. The rest of the evening, and on until the early morning, was spent in fellowship, game playing and discussing the future of their new church. Josh was in an especially good mood and enjoyed teasing the others with his flashlight. None of the others, including Janice, had remembered to bring a flashlight and Josh wasted no opportunity to remind them of this. But, finally, the young people tired. Around 3:00 a.m., they were finally asleep. At 4:00 a.m. Janice awoke to loud snoring near her on the left side of the sanctuary. A moment later, she thought she heard a faint noise coming from the sanctuary. She suspected a mouse nosing around the communion wafers. Janice briefly considered getting up to take a look around, but knew that it was totally dark in there with no night lights of any kind. After these disruptions, she slept soundly until 8:00 a.m., when Allison woke her. Allison and the other girls had slept in the rooms opposite the boys and Janice. Allison had to cross through the sanctuary to wake Janice and noticed the communion items missing. She mentioned this to Janice after waking her. “Yeah, right,” Janice said, teasingly, remembering Allison as the free spirited one in the group. “I’m serious.” The tone in Allison’s voice told Janice that she was not joking. After checking out the altar, Allison’s claim was confirmed. Janice asked her, “Who took the communion set?” Even the leftover crackers and grape juice were missing. Allison replied, “You’re probably thinking it was me.” “Was it you?” “No, but I was up around 5:00 o’clock to go to the bathroom.” The tiny bathroom was to the right side of the front door – the side of the sanctuary where the girls spent the night. Allison would have exited her room, turned left and walked down the side aisle to the bathroom. This could be accomplished in the dark sanctuary, but with difficulty, as she pointed out. “I even stubbed my toe on the side of a pew. The lower legs are made of metal and it hurts.” Allison showed Janice the fresh, ugly bruise on her right, big toe. She added, “I wouldn’t have hurt my toe against the wall if I was feeling my way along it with my hands.” Janice thought for a moment and then told Allison. “Get everybody together. This is not funny. And I think I know who took the communion set.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. List what had to be done  \n • Walk through a pitch-black sanctuary without bumping into pews.  \n • Find the silver chalice and bread tray on the podium, lift them off quietly, and get out.  \n • Carry off even the crackers and grape-juice container.  \n • Do it sometime after 3 a.m. (everyone finally asleep) and before 5 a.m. (Allison’s bathroom trip, when the set was already gone).\n\n2. Who could move around safely in total darkness?  \n Only one person had a light: 15-year-old JOSH DARVIN.  All evening he kept flashing it around and kidding the others for not bringing one.  No one else had so much as a night-light; Allison proved that at 5 a.m. when she painfully stubbed her toe.\n\n3. Where was everybody when the theft occurred?  \n • 4 a.m. – Janice is awakened on the left side by “loud snoring” coming from the boys’ room, then hears a faint noise in the sanctuary.  \n  Justin, who had recent sinus surgery, is the one obviously snoring; therefore he is in his sleeping-bag, not in the sanctuary.  \n  The other boy in that room is Josh – the only person who could be missing and making the noise Janice heard.  \n • 5 a.m. – Allison crosses the dark sanctuary to the bathroom and has to grope blindly; the communion set is already gone.  \n  So the theft happened between 3 and 5 a.m., most probably right around 4 a.m., exactly when Janice heard the sound.\n\n4. Physical ability  \n • Janelle can barely walk with her broken ankle.  \n • Heather and Allison had no light; Allison proved it by stubbing her toe.  \n • Justin was snoring, sick and coatless in bed.  \n • Josh possessed the only flashlight, is healthy and agile, and likes practical jokes.\n\n5. Motive  \n Not necessarily malicious; Josh likes teasing and pranks – earlier he delighted in showing off the one flashlight.  A prankster is the one most likely to think, “Wouldn’t it be funny if the communion set were gone in the morning?”\n\n6. Conclusion  \n All clues converge on Josh.  No evidence points to an accomplice.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJanice Cummings, Janelle Herbst, Heather Guse, Allison ­­­­­(surname not given), Justin Paul, Josh Darvin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJosh Darvin\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• 3:00 a.m. Everyone has finally settled down.  \n• About 4:00 a.m. Josh, who has kept his flashlight with him, gets up while Justin (his roommate) is fast asleep and snoring loudly.  \n Using the flashlight he slips into the sanctuary, quietly lifts the silver chalice, bread tray, crackers and grape-juice bottle from the podium, and carries them away (most likely hides them somewhere outside or in another room) as a prank.  \n The faint clinking Janice hears is Josh handling the metal pieces; the beam of his flashlight is not noticed because Janice stays on her couch with her eyes closed.  \n• 5:00 a.m. Allison, groping in total darkness and without a flashlight, crosses the sanctuary to the bathroom and stubs her toe; the communion set has already vanished.  \n• 8:00 a.m. Allison discovers the disappearance and wakes Janice, who quickly puts the clues together: only Josh had the means (flashlight) and opportunity (Justin’s identifiable snoring supplied an alibi for the other boy).\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Janice Cummings – supervising adult, asleep on the couch; nothing to gain.  \n• Janelle Herbst – immobilised by a painful broken ankle; could not grope through a dark sanctuary.  \n• Heather Guse – no light, no motive, slept on the opposite side; would have had to crawl around pews in the blackness.  \n• Allison – mischievous reputation but clearly had no flashlight; her bruised toe proves she really was feeling her way blindly after the theft.  \n• Justin Paul – was the loud snorer Janice heard at 4 a.m., establishing that he was in bed during the theft; recent sinus surgery makes the snoring detail believable.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

The service is in Justin’s big coat pocket. I ate the crackers and drank the grape juice.”\nJanice thought for a moment, and then replied, softly, “And no real harm was done. But, this is the Lord’s house and He is not to be mocked.” Pausing for a moment, she continued with emphasis, “You drank the blood and ate the body of Christ out of proper context. That is wrong.”\nJosh, now visibly shaken, asked, “What are you going to do?” Janice took a moment before answering. “Nothing,” she said.\n“Nothing?” Josh asked, incredulously. He was used to harsh, unforgiving school administrators. “Why not?”\nJanice smiled a thin smile. She said, “Don’t you remember your Sunday school lessons? It was Jesus who said, “Go and sin no more.”",
