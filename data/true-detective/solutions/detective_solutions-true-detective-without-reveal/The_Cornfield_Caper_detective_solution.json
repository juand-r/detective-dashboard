    "full_text": "Joe Farmer walked aimlessly through the freshly cut corn maze, his boots sinking deep into the muddy earth. Joe, however, didn't notice his sinking situation, or the trail of deep footprints he left behind him. His attention was focused on the small open box in his right hand, and the diamond engagement ring inside it. \"I am the luckiest man in the world,\" he said to himself, \"… of all the guys here, she picked me.\" She being the one woman in the area that every guy in his town (including his brothers) wished to be picked by, the beautiful Ms. Maria Irene. \"Maria, will you marry me? … Will you marry me, Maria? … Maria, I love you. Marry me?\" Joe spoke each of the questions aloud, trying to determine which one he thought sounded best. Where would he ask? Would he get down on one knee? A cracking sound nearby, however, interrupted his train of thought. He stopped and looked around in all directions for the source of the sound, but the corn was too thick to see anything other than the short path he was on. \"Hello?\" Joe called out. \"Is someone there?\" Joe wasn't sure why, but being in the corn maze always made him feel uneasy, even though it was on his family’s farm. Even though he and his brothers had spent their childhood chasing one another through the fields. Another sound. This one was closer. Joe was just about to turn around and head back for the farmhouse, when he felt a sudden burst of pain erupt in his head. He blacked out before he could turn around to identify his attacker. \"Joe! Are you out here? Joe?\" Joe could hear his little brother, Billy, calling out to him from somewhere off in the corn maze. Slowly he opened his eyes to see that he was face up in the muddy path. \"I'm over here,\" he shouted as he lifted himself to his feet. He had just started to brush the dirt off his pants, when he noticed the ring box he had been holding was gone. He instantly began to search the area for it, but could see nothing other than his footprints and the footprints of the person who must have attacked him. He bent down to study the offender’s tracks. They appeared slightly less deep and closer together than his prints, but the impressions were too smeared for Joe to be able to determine the tread or size of the shoe. \"Joe, there you are.\" Joe looked up to see Billy coming towards him. \"I've been looking all over for you. Austin has lunch ready. Everybody else is already inside,\" Billy said. Joe had started to form a reply, but Billy had already turned around and disappeared back toward the house. Joe spent a few more minutes alone looking for the ring, but he knew it was gone. Taken by the person who had hit him. When Joe entered the kitchen, his brothers were all seated at their places around the table. Nick, the oldest and biggest of the bunch by four inches and nearly fifty pounds, sat at the head of the table. Beside him sat the next oldest brother, Austin. He, like Nick, had inherited their father's size and was at least two inches taller than Joe. Opposite the table from Nick sat Billy, the youngest, but smartest boy of the family. \"Which one of you did it?\" Joe asked. \"Which of us did what?\" Nick replied. \"Which of you stole the ring?\" Joe was beginning to get angry now. \"What ring? Austin replied. \"The engagement ring. The one I got for Maria. One of you followed me out into the corn maze, hit me with something, and then made off with the ring I had been holding. You all have feelings for her, but she picked me. So tell me which one of you did it?\" \"Well it wasn't me.\" Austin said. \"I haven't left the house all day.\" \"And it wasn't me.\" Billy said. \"I was helping Austin with lunch in here, until I went to go find you, and then I got lost in the corn maze.\" \"It wasn't me, either.\" Nick said. \"I was outside, but I was over by the barn working on the tractor.\" Joe eyed them all, certain he now he knew who'd taken the ring.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive\n   • All three brothers (Nick, Austin, Billy) are said to “have feelings” for Maria Irene, so jealousy is a motive they all share. \n   • The only one, however, who is still clearly competing with Joe for Maria’s affection is Billy, the “smartest” (i.e., most calculating) brother and the one closest to Joe in age.\n\n2. Opportunity / Where-abouts at the critical moment\n   • The assault occurs only a minute or two before Billy’s voice is first heard calling Joe’s name.\n   • Billy admits that, shortly before that, he had left the kitchen and entered the maze “to go find” Joe.  \n   • Nick says he was by the barn repairing a tractor—farther from the maze, with no reason to abandon the job and no evidence he did.  \n   • Austin says he never left the house and was busy preparing lunch; Billy corroborates that until Billy himself stepped outside.  \n   • Therefore, only Billy is positively known to have been inside the maze during the narrow window when Joe was struck.\n\n3. Physical evidence (footprints)\n   • Joe’s attacker left tracks “slightly less deep and closer together” than Joe’s own.  \n   • Joe is of middle height/weight; Nick and Austin are each larger and heavier than Joe, so their prints would sink deeper and their strides would likely be longer, not shorter.  \n   • Billy—the youngest and presumably lightest brother—fits the shallower, shorter-stride prints perfectly.\n\n4. Behavior after the assault\n   • The very first voice Joe hears when regaining consciousness is Billy’s, who is already in the maze.  \n   • Approaching the victim immediately after an assault is classic behaviour for a culprit seeking to appear helpful and fabricate an alibi (“I got lost looking for you”).\n   • Austin and Nick never set foot in the maze at all during the incident.\n\nLogical deduction\n   • The only brother whose size matches the footprint clues is Billy.  \n   • He is the only brother confirmed to be in the maze at the critical time.  \n   • His quick appearance, coupled with a flimsy “I got lost” explanation, is consistent with the thief trying to hide guilt.  \n   • Therefore, Billy is the thief and assailant; there is no evidence that either Austin or Nick helped him.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nNick Farmer, Austin Farmer, Billy Farmer\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nBilly Farmer\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nKnowing Joe planned to propose to Maria Irene that afternoon, Billy grew resentful. While helping Austin in the kitchen he watched for the moment Joe wandered into the corn maze alone. Billy then slipped out, picked up a heavy cornstalk or similar object, and followed Joe’s fresh, deep footprints through the mud. \n\nHe purposely cracked a stalk to test whether Joe was alert, then stepped up behind his brother and struck him on the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. Billy scooped up the ring box, stuffed it into his pocket, and dragged one foot slightly as he retreated, creating shallower, close-set prints consistent with his lighter build.\n\nTo disguise his crime, Billy immediately began calling Joe’s name as though he had just arrived in the maze to look for him. When Joe came to, Billy was already nearby, playing the concerned brother. They walked back to the farmhouse; Billy quietly hid the ring before re-entering the kitchen for lunch and offered the prepared alibi that he had merely “got lost” in the maze.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nNick Farmer – He is significantly larger than Joe; his prints would have been deeper and spaced farther apart, contradicting the physical evidence. He was occupied at the barn, away from the maze, with no sign anyone saw him leave.\n\nAustin Farmer – Austin’s size also contradicts the footprint evidence, and both his own statement and Billy’s earlier confirm he remained in the kitchen preparing lunch until the meal was ready. No one saw him leave the house, and Joe encountered no other footprints matching a heavier man.\n\nTherefore neither Nick nor Austin had both the physical characteristics and the opportunity required to commit the assault and theft; the clues point exclusively to Billy.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
