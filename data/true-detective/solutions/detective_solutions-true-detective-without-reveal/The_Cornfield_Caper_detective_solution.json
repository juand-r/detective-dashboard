    "full_text": "Joe Farmer walked aimlessly through the freshly cut corn maze, his boots sinking deep into the muddy earth. Joe, however, didn't notice his sinking situation, or the trail of deep footprints he left behind him. His attention was focused on the small open box in his right hand, and the diamond engagement ring inside it. \"I am the luckiest man in the world,\" he said to himself, \"… of all the guys here, she picked me.\" She being the one woman in the area that every guy in his town (including his brothers) wished to be picked by, the beautiful Ms. Maria Irene. \"Maria, will you marry me? … Will you marry me, Maria? … Maria, I love you. Marry me?\" Joe spoke each of the questions aloud, trying to determine which one he thought sounded best. Where would he ask? Would he get down on one knee? A cracking sound nearby, however, interrupted his train of thought. He stopped and looked around in all directions for the source of the sound, but the corn was too thick to see anything other than the short path he was on. \"Hello?\" Joe called out. \"Is someone there?\" Joe wasn't sure why, but being in the corn maze always made him feel uneasy, even though it was on his family’s farm. Even though he and his brothers had spent their childhood chasing one another through the fields. Another sound. This one was closer. Joe was just about to turn around and head back for the farmhouse, when he felt a sudden burst of pain erupt in his head. He blacked out before he could turn around to identify his attacker. \"Joe! Are you out here? Joe?\" Joe could hear his little brother, Billy, calling out to him from somewhere off in the corn maze. Slowly he opened his eyes to see that he was face up in the muddy path. \"I'm over here,\" he shouted as he lifted himself to his feet. He had just started to brush the dirt off his pants, when he noticed the ring box he had been holding was gone. He instantly began to search the area for it, but could see nothing other than his footprints and the footprints of the person who must have attacked him. He bent down to study the offender’s tracks. They appeared slightly less deep and closer together than his prints, but the impressions were too smeared for Joe to be able to determine the tread or size of the shoe. \"Joe, there you are.\" Joe looked up to see Billy coming towards him. \"I've been looking all over for you. Austin has lunch ready. Everybody else is already inside,\" Billy said. Joe had started to form a reply, but Billy had already turned around and disappeared back toward the house. Joe spent a few more minutes alone looking for the ring, but he knew it was gone. Taken by the person who had hit him. When Joe entered the kitchen, his brothers were all seated at their places around the table. Nick, the oldest and biggest of the bunch by four inches and nearly fifty pounds, sat at the head of the table. Beside him sat the next oldest brother, Austin. He, like Nick, had inherited their father's size and was at least two inches taller than Joe. Opposite the table from Nick sat Billy, the youngest, but smartest boy of the family. \"Which one of you did it?\" Joe asked. \"Which of us did what?\" Nick replied. \"Which of you stole the ring?\" Joe was beginning to get angry now. \"What ring? Austin replied. \"The engagement ring. The one I got for Maria. One of you followed me out into the corn maze, hit me with something, and then made off with the ring I had been holding. You all have feelings for her, but she picked me. So tell me which one of you did it?\" \"Well it wasn't me.\" Austin said. \"I haven't left the house all day.\" \"And it wasn't me.\" Billy said. \"I was helping Austin with lunch in here, until I went to go find you, and then I got lost in the corn maze.\" \"It wasn't me, either.\" Nick said. \"I was outside, but I was over by the barn working on the tractor.\" Joe eyed them all, certain he now he knew who'd taken the ring.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • All three brothers—Nick, Austin and Billy—are said to be smitten with Maria Irene, so jealousy is common to all of them. Motive alone therefore does not single anyone out.  \n2. Opportunity / Alibis  \n   • Nick: says he was “over by the barn working on the tractor.” That is outdoors, but on a different part of the farm.  \n   • Austin: claims he “hasn’t left the house all day.” If the statement is true, he could not have been in the maze.  \n   • Billy: helped Austin with lunch “until I went to go find you,” i.e., he left the house expressly to enter the corn-maze right before Joe regained consciousness.  \n   Opportunity therefore exists only for Nick (if he left the barn) or Billy (who undeniably went into the maze).  \n3. Physical clues  \n   • Depth of footprints: Joe’s own boot marks are “deep”; the attacker’s are “slightly less deep.” Both Nick (biggest, heaviest) and Austin (taller, heavier than Joe) would be expected to leave marks at least as deep as Joe’s, not shallower. Billy, the youngest and lightest, would leave exactly the kind of shallower impressions described.  \n   • Stride length: the attacker’s prints are “closer together,” consistent with a shorter person—again pointing to Billy, not to the two taller brothers.  \n4. Timing  \n   • Billy is the first (and only) brother Joe hears calling for him while he is still on the ground, which fits perfectly with someone who has just committed the assault and is now pretending to “search” for the victim to manufacture an alibi.  \n   • When Billy reaches the kitchen, he is able to announce to the others that lunch is ready and that Joe is still outside—showing he had time to strike Joe, pocket the ring, walk back, and re-enter the house before setting out again to “find” Joe.  \n5. Logical deduction  \n   • The physical evidence rules out Nick and Austin.  \n   • Billy had the only realistic opportunity; his story of “getting lost in the maze” is a ready-made excuse for unexplained time inside the corn.  \n   • Therefore Billy is the thief and assailant.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nNick Farmer, Austin Farmer, Billy Farmer\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nBilly Farmer\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBilly, jealous that Maria had chosen Joe over him, noticed his brother heading into the corn maze with the ring box. Knowing the maze layout from childhood games, he slipped out of the kitchen while Austin was busy with the food, followed Joe along a parallel row, and waited until Joe stopped to rehearse his proposal. Coming up behind him, Billy struck Joe on the back of the head with a short length of pipe or similar tool he had picked up in the barn on the way. He grabbed the ring box and hurried back toward the house, wiping his shoes on the damp leaves as he went.  \nOnce inside, Billy acted as though he had never left, then volunteered to “go find” Joe for lunch, loudly calling Joe’s name to create a witness-proof search. Re-entering the maze along a different row, he approached Joe from the front, pretending innocence. He pocketed the ring and later intended either to keep it from Joe forever or to offer it to Maria himself.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nNick: Being the heaviest brother, his footprints would have been deeper than Joe’s, not shallower. He was also occupied at the barn, an area away from the maze, and had no reason to lie about being outdoors because simply being outdoors does not place him in the maze at the right time.\n\nAustin: Taller and heavier than Joe; he would likewise leave deeper prints. His claim of “not leaving the house all day” is corroborated by the fact Billy says he was helping Austin with lunch—placing Austin in the kitchen continuously. No evidence contradicts that alibi, and the footprints exclude him.\n\nThus only Billy fits every physical and situational clue, while the other brothers do not.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
