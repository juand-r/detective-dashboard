    "full_text": "When Merv Weiss called me in on the Great Candy Cane Caper, I wasn’t exactly striped with enthusiasm. His sons, the Weiss boys, or the Three Weiss Men as they were other wise known in the neighborhood, had a well-earned reputation for being a cantankerous lot. But their father was an old friend, and I’d shopped at his hardware store for over forty years. So, I put my other cases on hold for a day, while I looked into the theft of Merv’s giant candy cane. “Hello, Ronald,” I said, as I pushed through the front doors of the store. “Uh-huh,” the oldest of Merv’s three sons grumbled in reply. Ronald was manager of the Outdoors department, and presently he was having one heck of a time lifting an elf garden gnome off the floor. His over-ample stomach kept getting in the way, his woefully thin arms trembling with the effort of hefting the cast-concrete weight. “Let me give you a hand with that,” I volunteered. Ronald heaved to his feet and watched as I easily scooped up the fifty-pound elf and deposited him in a nearby wheelbarrow for safe and easy transport. The man grunted something like thanks, and then trundled off in the direction of his department with his cargo. “Don’t tell me my father hired you to ‘investigate’ the disappearance of that stupid candy cane of his?” That was Michael Weiss, youngest of the Three Weiss Men. He came limping up to me with a look as unfriendly as his brother’s. “Yes,” I replied, “I’m-” “What a waste of money!” the man exclaimed, throwing up his hands. “If he’d let me light up the outside of the store like I’d asked, we wouldn’t have this problem.” Michael was in charge of the store’s Electrical department – lights, fixtures and all things conductive wire-related. He was just as tall as Ronald, but much thinner. “You wanted to string some Christmas lights?” I said. He snorted. “I could’ve made this place brighter than the North Star! But Dad insisted on blowing the Christmas promotional budget on a twenty-foot-long candy cane.” “Okay, that’ll be enough, son.” That was my old friend, Merv, emerged from his office to greet me. Michael tossed his hands into the air in another display of exasperation and limped off down an aisle towards his department. “Is his leg still bothering him, Merv?” I asked. “Yes, it hasn’t fully healed since he got tangled up in that spool of wire a month ago and pulled a hamstring.” I glanced out the door, just as Merv’s third son, Frank, drove up and parked at the curb in front of the store. “Frank’s got a new car, I see.” Merv looked that way, and nodded. “Yes, a hybrid. It is environmentally friendly. How he fits all of his family in there, I have no idea.” The father of six managed the store’s Power Tools department. He nodded curtly at his dad and me as he came through the doors, then walked off in the direction of his section of the store. “Let’s go into my office,” Merv said. “I’ve got something to show you.” Merv’s office was little more than a cubbyhole, jammed full of stuff like his store was. A computer monitor sat on a pile of papers on his desk, and he directed my attention to the screen. “This is the surveillance video from last night – when the candy cane was stolen. I only have the one camera at the front of the store.” He shrugged his shoulders. “It’s all I can afford. And besides, this is still a pretty good neighborhood.” We stared at a black and white picture of the dimmed store interior, long after closing time. A huge candy cane was clearly visible at the front of the store, lying on its side, elevated at the curly end, like some giant Christmas bandy stick. “Kids loved it,” Merv said, shrugging again. “I was going to have a drawing for it on Christmas Eve.” Everything appeared calm and quiet in the store, like the night before Xmas. Until, suddenly, a man strode briskly into camera range – a man dressed in a Santa suit, complete with furry cap, black boots, white beard and overstuffed stomach. “Clever disguise,” I commented. “There’s no way to make out his face or true physique in that costume.” Merv nodded, as the not-so-jolly Saint Nick shoved the curly end of the giant cane off its platform and onto the floor. He then picked up the kids’ candy dream by its curl and dragged it off out of the picture. “That’s it?” “That’s it,” Merv said. “Not much to go on, is it?” Brent Pearson stuck his head into the office. “Okay if I order those sinks we were talking about, Merv?” Brent was in charge of the Plumbing department. That, and the fact he was younger and a half-inch shorter than the Three Weiss Men, led them to call him ‘the little plumber boy’. “Sure,” Merv replied. “Great. I’ll drive over and pick them up in my van later today.” “Want a mint?” I said, pulling a roll out of my pocket and offering one to Brent. “No, thanks. I’m diabetic, remember?” “Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.” Brent went about his business and Merv and I walked to the back of the store, out onto the loading dock. “That thieving Claus must have dragged my candy cane out here, loaded it into something big enough to haul a twenty-foot, hundred-pound treat away,” Merv commented. “I’m guessing Father Christmas didn’t come down the chimney. So how’d he get in?” Merv looked down. “That’s the thing. The store was locked up tight, and there is no sign of a forced entry.” I whistled. “So, it is an inside job.” Merv nodded disconsolately. “That’s why I haven’t called in the police. All of my boys and Brent have keys to the store, and individual keys to their own departments. They shutter off their sections of the store at the end of the day and lock them, and then I lock the store itself.” I mulled that over, staring down at the cement-loading platform myself. I noticed something, and kneeled down, ran a wetted fingertip over a thin line of red and white shavings, tasted them. “Sweet.” I stood up and looked at Merv. “Well, old friend, I know who played bad Santa – took, instead of gave. And I know how he got away with the candy cane, too. It wasn’t with the help of eight tiny reindeer.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  WHO HAD A REASON TO TAKE IT?\n    • Ronald – no clear motive; he actually stocks outdoor decorations.  \n    • Michael – angry that the promotion money was spent on the cane; definite motive.  \n    • Frank – six children who would love a 100-lb candy cane; possible motive.  \n    • Brent – not a family member, diabetic (avoids sugar); no obvious motive.  \n\n2.  HOW HEAVY / HOW BIG IS THE THING?\n    • 20-feet long, about 100 lb.  To move it you must either\n         a) be strong enough to drag it intact and have a vehicle long enough to haul 20 ft, or\n         b) cut it into shorter pieces.\n\n3.  WHO COULD PHYSICALLY DRAG IT?\n    • Ronald struggled with a 50-lb garden gnome; he plainly lacks the strength.  \n    • Michael has a bad ham-string and limps; long, heavy work is out of the question.  \n    • Frank and Brent handle power tools and plumbing fixtures every day; both are used to hefting heavy objects.\n\n4.  WHAT VEHICLE WAS AVAILABLE?\n    • Brent owns a large plumbing van – long enough to carry the cane whole; he would not need to cut it.  \n    • Frank just bought a compact hybrid that even his own father jokes is too small for the family, certainly too small for a 20-ft cane – unless it were sawn into sections.  \n    • Ronald and Michael’s vehicles are not mentioned.\n\n5.  THE ONLY REAL CLUE AT THE SCENE\n    • On the loading dock the detective finds a THIN LINE of red-and-white “sawdust” – not a heap of scrapings from friction, but the fine dust you get when a very sharp power-saw blade goes through hard candy.\n    • That means the thief cut the cane on the dock before loading it.\n    • The person most likely to have a keyed-in familiarity with power saws – and ready access to cordless ones – is Frank, the Power-Tools department manager.\n\n6.  LOGICAL ELIMINATION\n    • If the cane was cut so it would fit into a small vehicle, the thief cannot be Brent; his plumbing van would take it whole.\n    • Strength eliminates Ronald and Michael.\n    • Motive, means and opportunity converge on Frank: he needed to shorten the cane (loading-dock sawdust shows that), he has the saws, the strength, the keys – and six candy-loving kids supply the motive.\n\nTherefore Frank Weiss is the only person who matches every required condition.\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRonald Weiss, Michael Weiss, Frank Weiss, Brent Pearson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nFrank Weiss\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFrank, the Power-Tools manager, stayed behind after closing, hiding in his department until his father locked up.  After the lights were out he donned a padded Santa suit (already hidden in his section), walked to the front of the store and dragged the 20-foot candy cane to the rear loading dock.  There he used one of the cordless reciprocating saws from his own stock to slice the cane into three or four manageable sections, leaving a thin line of red-and-white sawdust on the concrete.  He loaded the pieces into his new hybrid, relocked the back door with his store key and drove home to present the prize to his six delighted children.  Next morning he arrived at work in the same small hybrid—now empty—and pretended to know nothing about the theft.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Ronald Weiss – lacks the physical strength to move a 100-lb object, even just to drag it.  \n• Michael Weiss – his ham-string injury and limp would not allow the strenuous work seen on the video.  \n• Brent Pearson – owns a large van and therefore would not have needed to saw the cane; the loading-dock “sawdust” proves the cane was cut.  He also has no evident motive and, being diabetic, hardly needs a huge sugar stick.  \nHence only Frank Weiss fits every clue.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

There’re still a few shavings around that he missed in his clean-up.”\n“But any one of the four could have done that, couldn’t they? How do you know for sure it was Frank?”\n“Simple. The man on the surveillance tape walked into camera range; he didn’t limp. That lets Michael off the hook. And there’s no way Ronald could’ve dragged that heavy candy cane around like the man in the video. He just doesn’t have the strength. So, he’s innocent. And Brent Pearson is diabetic. He’s got about as much use for a hundred pounds of cane sugar as Santa has for another plate of cookies.”\nMerv nodded, convinced. “But why did Frank do it?”\nIt was my turn to shrug. “I guess six kids can put an awful strain on a family’s candy budget this time of year.”",

All of my boys and Brent have keys to the store, and individual keys to their own departments. They shutter off their sections of the store at the end of the day and lock them, and then I lock the store itself.” I mulled that over, staring down at the cement-loading platform myself. I noticed something, and kneeled down, ran a wetted fingertip over a thin line of red and white shavings, tasted them. “Sweet.” I stood up and looked at Merv. “Well, old friend, I know who played bad Santa – took, instead of gave. And I know how he got away with the candy cane, too. It wasn’t with the help of eight tiny reindeer.”",

      "answer": "(b) Frank Weiss",
      "outcome": "“Who? How?” Merv asked, astonished that I could wrap up the case so quickly.\n“Your son, Frank,” I stated bluntly. “As the man with the power tools, he simply power-sawed the giant candy cane into manageable pieces and then stacked them in his car and drove away. There’re still a few shavings around that he missed in his clean-up.”\n“But any one of the four could have done that, couldn’t they? How do you know for sure it was Frank?”\n“Simple. The man on the surveillance tape walked into camera range; he didn’t limp. That lets Michael off the hook. And there’s no way Ronald could’ve dragged that heavy candy cane around like the man in the video. He just doesn’t have the strength. So, he’s innocent. And Brent Pearson is diabetic. He’s got about as much use for a hundred pounds of cane sugar as Santa has for another plate of cookies.”\nMerv nodded, convinced. “But why did Frank do it?”\nIt was my turn to shrug. “I guess six kids can put an awful strain on a family’s candy budget this time of year.”"
