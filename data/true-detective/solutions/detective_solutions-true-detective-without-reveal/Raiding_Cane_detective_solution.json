    "full_text": "When Merv Weiss called me in on the Great Candy Cane Caper, I wasn’t exactly striped with enthusiasm. His sons, the Weiss boys, or the Three Weiss Men as they were other wise known in the neighborhood, had a well-earned reputation for being a cantankerous lot. But their father was an old friend, and I’d shopped at his hardware store for over forty years. So, I put my other cases on hold for a day, while I looked into the theft of Merv’s giant candy cane. “Hello, Ronald,” I said, as I pushed through the front doors of the store. “Uh-huh,” the oldest of Merv’s three sons grumbled in reply. Ronald was manager of the Outdoors department, and presently he was having one heck of a time lifting an elf garden gnome off the floor. His over-ample stomach kept getting in the way, his woefully thin arms trembling with the effort of hefting the cast-concrete weight. “Let me give you a hand with that,” I volunteered. Ronald heaved to his feet and watched as I easily scooped up the fifty-pound elf and deposited him in a nearby wheelbarrow for safe and easy transport. The man grunted something like thanks, and then trundled off in the direction of his department with his cargo. “Don’t tell me my father hired you to ‘investigate’ the disappearance of that stupid candy cane of his?” That was Michael Weiss, youngest of the Three Weiss Men. He came limping up to me with a look as unfriendly as his brother’s. “Yes,” I replied, “I’m-” “What a waste of money!” the man exclaimed, throwing up his hands. “If he’d let me light up the outside of the store like I’d asked, we wouldn’t have this problem.” Michael was in charge of the store’s Electrical department – lights, fixtures and all things conductive wire-related. He was just as tall as Ronald, but much thinner. “You wanted to string some Christmas lights?” I said. He snorted. “I could’ve made this place brighter than the North Star! But Dad insisted on blowing the Christmas promotional budget on a twenty-foot-long candy cane.” “Okay, that’ll be enough, son.” That was my old friend, Merv, emerged from his office to greet me. Michael tossed his hands into the air in another display of exasperation and limped off down an aisle towards his department. “Is his leg still bothering him, Merv?” I asked. “Yes, it hasn’t fully healed since he got tangled up in that spool of wire a month ago and pulled a hamstring.” I glanced out the door, just as Merv’s third son, Frank, drove up and parked at the curb in front of the store. “Frank’s got a new car, I see.” Merv looked that way, and nodded. “Yes, a hybrid. It is environmentally friendly. How he fits all of his family in there, I have no idea.” The father of six managed the store’s Power Tools department. He nodded curtly at his dad and me as he came through the doors, then walked off in the direction of his section of the store. “Let’s go into my office,” Merv said. “I’ve got something to show you.” Merv’s office was little more than a cubbyhole, jammed full of stuff like his store was. A computer monitor sat on a pile of papers on his desk, and he directed my attention to the screen. “This is the surveillance video from last night – when the candy cane was stolen. I only have the one camera at the front of the store.” He shrugged his shoulders. “It’s all I can afford. And besides, this is still a pretty good neighborhood.” We stared at a black and white picture of the dimmed store interior, long after closing time. A huge candy cane was clearly visible at the front of the store, lying on its side, elevated at the curly end, like some giant Christmas bandy stick. “Kids loved it,” Merv said, shrugging again. “I was going to have a drawing for it on Christmas Eve.” Everything appeared calm and quiet in the store, like the night before Xmas. Until, suddenly, a man strode briskly into camera range – a man dressed in a Santa suit, complete with furry cap, black boots, white beard and overstuffed stomach. “Clever disguise,” I commented. “There’s no way to make out his face or true physique in that costume.” Merv nodded, as the not-so-jolly Saint Nick shoved the curly end of the giant cane off its platform and onto the floor. He then picked up the kids’ candy dream by its curl and dragged it off out of the picture. “That’s it?” “That’s it,” Merv said. “Not much to go on, is it?” Brent Pearson stuck his head into the office. “Okay if I order those sinks we were talking about, Merv?” Brent was in charge of the Plumbing department. That, and the fact he was younger and a half-inch shorter than the Three Weiss Men, led them to call him ‘the little plumber boy’. “Sure,” Merv replied. “Great. I’ll drive over and pick them up in my van later today.” “Want a mint?” I said, pulling a roll out of my pocket and offering one to Brent. “No, thanks. I’m diabetic, remember?” “Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.” Brent went about his business and Merv and I walked to the back of the store, out onto the loading dock. “That thieving Claus must have dragged my candy cane out here, loaded it into something big enough to haul a twenty-foot, hundred-pound treat away,” Merv commented. “I’m guessing Father Christmas didn’t come down the chimney. So how’d he get in?” Merv looked down. “That’s the thing. The store was locked up tight, and there is no sign of a forced entry.” I whistled. “So, it is an inside job.” Merv nodded disconsolately. “That’s why I haven’t called in the police. All of my boys and Brent have keys to the store, and individual keys to their own departments. They shutter off their sections of the store at the end of the day and lock them, and then I lock the store itself.” I mulled that over, staring down at the cement-loading platform myself. I noticed something, and kneeled down, ran a wetted fingertip over a thin line of red and white shavings, tasted them. “Sweet.” I stood up and looked at Merv. “Well, old friend, I know who played bad Santa – took, instead of gave. And I know how he got away with the candy cane, too. It wasn’t with the help of eight tiny reindeer.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n• Ronald – no grievance is mentioned; he liked the promotion.  \n• Michael – angry because the candy-cane blew the lighting budget, but his badly pulled hamstring makes man-handling a 20-foot, 100-lb object unlikely.  \n• Brent – diabetic and therefore has no use for a mountain of sugar; moreover he showed no annoyance about the cane.  \n• Frank – has six children who would certainly enjoy a mountain of peppermint; nothing else in the story displeases him more than the cost of Christmas for that brood.  \n\n2. Opportunity  \nAll four men have keys.  The surveillance camera covers only the front of the store, so the thief had to drag the cane to the rear loading dock and leave with it there.  \n• Ronald could drag it, but he could not even lift a 50-lb gnome; the cane weighed twice as much.  \n• Michael’s injured leg makes that drag even harder.  \n• Brent has a plumber’s van that could take the cane full-length, but the detective sees that the cane was sawn, not kept intact (red-and-white saw-dust, not a long scrape).  Brent owns no power tools; his department sells copper and PVC.  \n• Frank manages the Power-Tools department – saws, grinders, and extension cords are literally under his hand.\n\n3. Physical evidence  \nOn the loading dock the detective finds “a thin line of red and white shavings.”  \n• A drag would leave a long streak, not neat shavings.  \n• Shavings mean the cane was cut with a saw – exactly what Frank can do in his department.  \nThat same cut-up solution also explains how a twenty-foot stick could fit into Frank’s tiny new hybrid.  The belly in the Santa suit had to be padded, because Frank is not a large man; Ronald would not need padding.  The criminal therefore cannot be Ronald.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \nOnly one person (a) had the equipment ready to saw the cane, (b) had a vehicle that needed the cane shortened, and (c) is healthy enough to do the work: Frank Weiss.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRonald Weiss, Michael Weiss, Frank Weiss, Brent Pearson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nFrank Weiss\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFrank stayed late in his Power-Tools department after closing.  \nWhen the store was dark he put on a Santa suit with a pillow in the belly and walked into camera range from inside the store, so the recording shows only what Merv allowed us to see.  \nHe shoved the candy cane off its platform, grabbed the curl and dragged it away from the front camera toward the rear loading dock.  \nThere, using one of his own department’s circular saws, he cut the cane into short lengths; the operation produced the thin red-and-white shavings the detective later tasted.  \nThe pieces now fit easily into the back of his new hybrid.  He opened the loading-dock door with his store key, packed the candy, locked up, drove home and unloaded enough peppermint to make six children very happy on Christmas morning.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Ronald Weiss – His natural stomach is already “over-ample”; a padded Santa belly would be pointless.  More tellingly, Ronald could not lift a 50-lb concrete gnome; he could never wrestle a 100-lb candy cane to the rear of the store.  \n• Michael Weiss – He had the motive, but his badly pulled hamstring makes dragging and sawing a heavy object impossible.  He still limps noticeably in the morning.  \n• Brent Pearson – He owns the only vehicle large enough if the cane were whole, but the evidence shows the cane was cut into pieces.  Brent’s plumbing department lacks power saws, and as a diabetic he has no desire for giant sweets.  \nHence only Frank fits every circumstance: motive, ability, equipment and the physical traces he left behind.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

How?” Merv asked, astonished that I could wrap up the case so quickly.\n“Your son, Frank,” I stated bluntly. “As the man with the power tools, he simply power-sawed the giant candy cane into manageable pieces and then stacked them in his car and drove away. There’re still a few shavings around that he missed in his clean-up.”\n“But any one of the four could have done that, couldn’t they? How do you know for sure it was Frank?”\n“Simple. The man on the surveillance tape walked into camera range; he didn’t limp. That lets Michael off the hook. And there’s no way Ronald could’ve dragged that heavy candy cane around like the man in the video. He just doesn’t have the strength. So, he’s innocent. And Brent Pearson is diabetic. He’s got about as much use for a hundred pounds of cane sugar as Santa has for another plate of cookies.”\nMerv nodded, convinced. “But why did Frank do it?”\nIt was my turn to shrug. “I guess six kids can put an awful strain on a family’s candy budget this time of year.”",

      "outcome": "“Who? How?” Merv asked, astonished that I could wrap up the case so quickly.\n“Your son, Frank,” I stated bluntly. “As the man with the power tools, he simply power-sawed the giant candy cane into manageable pieces and then stacked them in his car and drove away. There’re still a few shavings around that he missed in his clean-up.”\n“But any one of the four could have done that, couldn’t they? How do you know for sure it was Frank?”\n“Simple. The man on the surveillance tape walked into camera range; he didn’t limp. That lets Michael off the hook. And there’s no way Ronald could’ve dragged that heavy candy cane around like the man in the video. He just doesn’t have the strength. So, he’s innocent. And Brent Pearson is diabetic. He’s got about as much use for a hundred pounds of cane sugar as Santa has for another plate of cookies.”\nMerv nodded, convinced. “But why did Frank do it?”\nIt was my turn to shrug. “I guess six kids can put an awful strain on a family’s candy budget this time of year.”"
