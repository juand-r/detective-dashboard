    "full_text": "Thursday night, November 21, 1963. The weather was mild in Oklahoma City and the five friends gathered in the small apartment of Steve Collier to study for tomorrow’s upcoming exams. They were all college students and not only were there tests to be taken tomorrow, the holiday season and final exams were creeping nearer and nearer. The evening was uneventful. All of them were seniors and had been friends for many years. Billy and Susan had dated for a while a couple of years ago but had broken up amicably and remained friends. Tonight was study night; tomorrow would be Friday night and time for weekend partying. Harrell left for home first, around 9:30. Harrell lived north of town and liked a good night’s sleep before test taking. Since he lived with his parents, Harrell used Steve’s telephone to call and tell his parents, he was on the way. It usually took about 20 minutes for him to drive from Steve’s apartment in near north Oklahoma City to his home farther out north. Billy and Susan left next, at 9:50. The campus was a couple miles from Steve’s apartment and occasionally Susan would walk back to her room when the weather was nice and if it was not too late, for curfew was at 11:00 and, after that, nobody could come in or out of the building until next morning. However, tonight she was tired and she gratefully accepted Billy’s offer of a ride. When he drove her home, Billy would escort her into the building reception desk, and then drive to his home in south Oklahoma City. However, he was a little farther out and the roads were rougher and darker than those Harrell traveled when returning home from Steve’s. In fact, several times Billy’s father called Steve when Billy was late in getting home. Diana was the last to leave, but it was not until almost 11:00. Diana lived with her parents, closer to Steve’s apartment than Billy or Harrell. Ever since she was a little girl, Diana loved to travel the dirt road around the east side of the lake when returning home. A very petite young woman, normally she very comfortably drove a Volkswagen but tonight she was in her father’s Cadillac and felt older than her 22 years, for a Cadillac was an “old people’s car”. Normally, Diana was not able to use her Dad’s car, but since her parents were on vacation till Friday, she was able to upgrade to the much bigger Cadillac. After Diana departed, Steve did what little cleaning up was needed and went to bed. Little did he know then that tomorrow, one of his friends would be missing. In large part because of the tragic events in Dallas, which were now a little more than 12 hours away, nobody would be certain what happened until after President Kennedy’s funeral. The next day, what would become known as the “Crime of the Century” happened at approximately 12:30 P.M. Oklahoma time, or CST, Central Standard Time, By 1:00 P.M. President Kennedy was pronounced dead and 75 million Americans would know of the shooting. That afternoon, overloaded telephone systems were breaking down all over the country and there were roadblocks as far north as Tulsa in Oklahoma, just in case Lee Harvey Oswald had not worked alone in murdering the president. The case of Steve Collier’s missing friend simply slipped through the cracks, for nobody knew for certain there was a disappearance until after the shooting in Dallas’ Dealey Plaza. The missing person’s family did not decide to notify the authorities until around noon as the missing student was an adult who had spent the night out unannounced before. When they attempted to place the call at a little after one they could not get through. They were not able to get through to the police department switchboard until early Friday evening. By then, police forces all over the country were dealing with a possible national security issue – maybe even the cold war with the USSR was heating up to a live one. A harried and overworked local police force could only do so much. So, Steve would not learn of his missing friend until Tuesday the 26th. Normally, news of a missing person would be all over the news in Oklahoma City, still a small town at heart in 1963. But, the shock of Friday night and Saturday had not worn off when Oswald himself was murdered late Sunday morning by Jack Ruby on national television at 11:21 A.M. CST. President Kennedy’s funeral was the next day, Monday, so there was no resemblance of anything normal until Tuesday morning. Steve, as did most Americans during that long nightmarish weekend, sat glued to his television set, scarcely aware of other events going on in the world, such as the tragic fire on Saturday at the Golden Age Nursing home in Fitchville, Ohio, which killed 63 of the 84 residents. Indeed, the streets of Oklahoma City were almost entirely devoid of traffic until after the president’s funeral. For three days, Oklahoma City resembled a ghost town to those few who were out and about. But, finally, on Tuesday a sad and sorrowful nation went back to work. Steve’s already overloaded senses were given another shock when Oklahoma City Police Lieutenant Rick Petit knocked on his apartment door early Tuesday afternoon. Steve had attended class that morning and had heard nothing concerning anyone being missing. After Lieutenant Petit explained his friend’s disappearance after leaving the apartment Thursday evening and his knowledge of the Thursday evening study session, Steve fought through the emotional numbness he felt, thought for a few moments and said to the officer, “I know who is missing without you having to tell me.”",

I want you to distinguish between the main culprit(s) and the accomplices (if any). If there are none, write None. If possible, include first and last names, as well as any aliases.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What does the officer actually tell Steve?\n   • Only that “your friend who left here Thursday night never arrived home.”\n   • He does NOT give a name.\n\n2. Why is Steve nevertheless able to answer at once?\n   • Because, of the four people who left, only one could have vanished for three-and-a-half days without Steve already having heard something.\n   • If it had been Harrell:  \n        – Harrell phoned his parents at 9:30 saying he was on the way.  \n        – He should have been home about 10:00.  \n        – If he never arrived, his parents would have been ringing Steve’s phone by 10:30 at the latest (long before the national phone jam on Friday afternoon).  \n        – So Steve would already have known.\n   • If it had been Billy:  \n        – Billy’s father always phoned Steve when Billy was late.  \n        – The same logic applies: Steve’s phone would have rung Thursday night.\n   • If it had been Susan:  \n        – The women’s dorm locked its doors at 11:00 and kept an entry log.  \n        – If Susan had failed to appear, the dorm would have called the campus police and then her parents in the small-hours of Friday; somebody would surely have spoken to Steve before Tuesday.\n   • Only Diana’s absence could go completely unnoticed for a while because:  \n        – Her parents were on vacation until Friday.  \n        – No one was waiting up for her Thursday night.  \n        – When they did come home Friday they tried to telephone police “a little after one” but the long-distance circuits were jammed by the Kennedy-assassination panic.  \n        – They finally got through late Friday evening, and a swamped police department did not get round to visiting Steve until Tuesday.\n\n   Therefore Steve knows at once that the missing friend must be DIANA.\n\n3. Does the story supply any hint of foul play?\n   • No motive is suggested for any of the other students.  \n   • No mention of robbery, quarrel, jealousy, etc.  \n   • Diana was driving an unfamiliar, over-sized Cadillac along a narrow, unlighted dirt road skirting the east side of a lake.  \n   • The obvious inference is an ACCIDENT: she missed a bend, the car plunged into the lake and sank; in 1963 seat belts were rare and Cadillacs were heavy—she probably drowned.\n\n4. If it was an accident, there is in fact no “culprit” in the criminal sense.  \n   • The disappearance looks mysterious only because the most news-saturated weekend in U.S. history completely diverted everybody’s attention.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nHarrell (only surname supplied), Billy (only given name supplied), Susan (only given name supplied), Steve Collier, random unknown stranger\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nNone – Diana’s disappearance was the result of a one-car road accident, not a crime.\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n23:00, Thursday, 21 Nov 1963  \nDiana leaves Steve Collier’s apartment. Feeling grown-up behind the wheel of her father’s big Cadillac, she chooses her favourite route: the lonely dirt road around the east side of the lake.\n\n23:10-23:20  \nOn a dark, unpaved curve she under-steers; the heavy Cadillac slides off the road, tumbles down the bank and splashes into the lake. The car sinks quickly. Diana, a small woman unused to the car’s huge doors and without seat-belts or shoulder harnesses (rare in 1963), cannot escape in time and drowns. The car comes to rest under several metres of water, invisible from the road.\n\nFri 22 Nov, morning  \nDiana’s parents return from vacation, see no sign of her, assume she is at college.  \n12:30 pm CST – President Kennedy is shot; within minutes telephone traffic surges to meltdown.\n\nFri 22 Nov, early afternoon  \nFinding Diana still not home, her parents begin phoning; circuits are jammed. They finally reach the Oklahoma City Police early Friday evening and file a missing-person report.\n\nWeekend 23-25 Nov  \nA skeleton-staffed, over-stretched police force puts the report aside while coping with security alerts linked to the assassination.\n\nTue 26 Nov  \nLieutenant Rick Petit, now back on routine duty, tracks down the last person known to have seen Diana – Steve Collier – and calls at his apartment.  \nHearing the officer say merely “one of your Thursday-night study group is missing”, Steve at once recognises it must be Diana, for no one else’s disappearance could have gone unremarked so long.\n\nSome days or weeks later (outside the scope of the narrative) the submerged Cadillac will be located and the mystery solved: tragic accident, no foul play.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nHarrell – left earliest, phoned home, would have been missed immediately; no motive, no opportunity once he was already twenty miles away on a different route.\n\nBilly – accompanied Susan to the dorm and then drove south; his own family would have raised the alarm within hours if he had diverted to harm Diana; again no motive.\n\nSusan – went straight into a locked dormitory at 11 pm, witnessed by the desk clerk; curfew rules give her an airtight alibi.\n\nSteve – remained in his apartment; the time-line does not allow him to leave, commit a crime on the lakeside road and get back unseen; no hint of motive.\n\nRandom stranger – possible in theory, but no evidence points that way, whereas the physical-accident explanation fits every known fact without requiring a perpetrator.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Lieutenant Petit, who had slept little since Thursday evening, numbly replied, “Excuse me?”\nSteve looked at the lieutenant and said, gently, “Well, excuse me, Lieutenant. I know you probably don’t know as much about this as you would if the president had not been shot.”\n“That’s safe to say,” Petit replied, dryly.\n“Then let me explain. It’s easier to tell you who is not missing. I know that it cannot be Susan, even though I did not see her since Thursday night. Not only did Billy take her back to her dorm, but word of her not returning would have been all over campus this morning, which it wasn’t.”\nPetit nodded his head, not mentioning that Susan Allen was properly logged back in Thursday evening at the dormitory reception desk and that she stayed in her room all weekend, still in grief and shock over the slain president.\nSteve continued, “It couldn’t have been Billy either. If Billy had not returned home, his worry-wart dad would have called me. He’s done it before.”\nAgain, Petit nodded, but he was nodding in such a way as not to confirm or deny what Steve was saying. Petit knew that Billy Friend was another of the group who stayed away from class since Friday.\n“Harrell had to have made it home. I know that is where he was heading because he called his parents before leaving. Since his parents were home, they would have reported him missing.\nPetit said, evenly, “So, you know it was Diana Scott who is missing.”\n“Yes, it’s got to be her. I suppose you know that she was in her dad’s car Thursday night.” Steve shuddered, “She always drives home around Lake Hefner. She is a short girl and Mr. Scott’s Caddy is huge. I bet she lost control on that dark and bumpy lake road.” More importantly, her parents were on vacation, so they would not have been there to report her missing.\nAFTERWARD\nWednesday morning, November 27. Mr. Scott’s Cadillac was hoisted out of a shallow inlet by the lake road running alongside. Diana’s dead body was slumped against the steering wheel. Apparently, she had been knocked unconscious when hitting the water. Lieutenant Petit was both saddened and relieved to find the body; relieved because this completed the search for Diana Scott before the Thanksgiving weekend began, saddened because he would have to inform her parents of the bad news and ruin their holiday.\nPetit noticed that the Cadillac’s dashboard clock was stopped at 11:10, fitting perfectly with what Steve Collier had told him. He would think often in the years to come that young Miss Petit died less than an hour before that fateful day of November 22, 1963, commenced at midnight.\n\nNOTE: While this story is a work of fiction, much of it is taken from a little known occurrence in Oklahoma City. On the evening of Thursday, November 21, 1963, a woman and her daughter left the home of friends to return to their home approximately five miles away. They were never seen or heard of again, until in the spring of 1990, when a small inlet off of Lake Hefner was drained and filled for an interstate highway project. The car and remains of the missing women were found in the lakebed, the dashboard clock indicating they had driven into the lake in late evening. The local police departments admitted that, had they not been so preoccupied with the Kennedy murder the next day, 200 miles south in Dallas, they would probably have been discovered the missing women much earlier. Known as the Elston case, this was, at the time of discovery, the oldest open case in the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation.",

Steve, as did most Americans during that long nightmarish weekend, sat glued to his television set, scarcely aware of other events going on in the world, such as the tragic fire on Saturday at the Golden Age Nursing home in Fitchville, Ohio, which killed 63 of the 84 residents. Indeed, the streets of Oklahoma City were almost entirely devoid of traffic until after the president’s funeral. For three days, Oklahoma City resembled a ghost town to those few who were out and about. But, finally, on Tuesday a sad and sorrowful nation went back to work. Steve’s already overloaded senses were given another shock when Oklahoma City Police Lieutenant Rick Petit knocked on his apartment door early Tuesday afternoon. Steve had attended class that morning and had heard nothing concerning anyone being missing. After Lieutenant Petit explained his friend’s disappearance after leaving the apartment Thursday evening and his knowledge of the Thursday evening study session, Steve fought through the emotional numbness he felt, thought for a few moments and said to the officer, “I know who is missing without you having to tell me.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Billy Friend; (b) Diana Scott; (c) Harrell Garner; (d) Susan Allen",
      "answer": "(b) Diana Scott",
      "outcome": "Lieutenant Petit, who had slept little since Thursday evening, numbly replied, “Excuse me?”\nSteve looked at the lieutenant and said, gently, “Well, excuse me, Lieutenant. I know you probably don’t know as much about this as you would if the president had not been shot.”\n“That’s safe to say,” Petit replied, dryly.\n“Then let me explain. It’s easier to tell you who is not missing. I know that it cannot be Susan, even though I did not see her since Thursday night. Not only did Billy take her back to her dorm, but word of her not returning would have been all over campus this morning, which it wasn’t.”\nPetit nodded his head, not mentioning that Susan Allen was properly logged back in Thursday evening at the dormitory reception desk and that she stayed in her room all weekend, still in grief and shock over the slain president.\nSteve continued, “It couldn’t have been Billy either. If Billy had not returned home, his worry-wart dad would have called me. He’s done it before.”\nAgain, Petit nodded, but he was nodding in such a way as not to confirm or deny what Steve was saying. Petit knew that Billy Friend was another of the group who stayed away from class since Friday.\n“Harrell had to have made it home. I know that is where he was heading because he called his parents before leaving. Since his parents were home, they would have reported him missing.\nPetit said, evenly, “So, you know it was Diana Scott who is missing.”\n“Yes, it’s got to be her. I suppose you know that she was in her dad’s car Thursday night.” Steve shuddered, “She always drives home around Lake Hefner. She is a short girl and Mr. Scott’s Caddy is huge. I bet she lost control on that dark and bumpy lake road.” More importantly, her parents were on vacation, so they would not have been there to report her missing.\nAFTERWARD\nWednesday morning, November 27. Mr. Scott’s Cadillac was hoisted out of a shallow inlet by the lake road running alongside. Diana’s dead body was slumped against the steering wheel. Apparently, she had been knocked unconscious when hitting the water. Lieutenant Petit was both saddened and relieved to find the body; relieved because this completed the search for Diana Scott before the Thanksgiving weekend began, saddened because he would have to inform her parents of the bad news and ruin their holiday.\nPetit noticed that the Cadillac’s dashboard clock was stopped at 11:10, fitting perfectly with what Steve Collier had told him. He would think often in the years to come that young Miss Petit died less than an hour before that fateful day of November 22, 1963, commenced at midnight.\n\nNOTE: While this story is a work of fiction, much of it is taken from a little known occurrence in Oklahoma City. On the evening of Thursday, November 21, 1963, a woman and her daughter left the home of friends to return to their home approximately five miles away. They were never seen or heard of again, until in the spring of 1990, when a small inlet off of Lake Hefner was drained and filled for an interstate highway project. The car and remains of the missing women were found in the lakebed, the dashboard clock indicating they had driven into the lake in late evening. The local police departments admitted that, had they not been so preoccupied with the Kennedy murder the next day, 200 miles south in Dallas, they would probably have been discovered the missing women much earlier. Known as the Elston case, this was, at the time of discovery, the oldest open case in the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation."
