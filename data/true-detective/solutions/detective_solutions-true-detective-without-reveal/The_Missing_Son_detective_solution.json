    "full_text": "As Amanda fixed breakfast for her four sons, she thought this Wednesday morning in May was truly a gift from God. It was already warm with bright sunshine and no clouds in the sky. But Amanda knew the boys were tired. She felt sorry for her husband Warren this morning. He had left early to spend the day with his father, as last night his mother had passed away. The family had been notified of her heart attack just after dinner, and they spent the rest of the evening at the hospital. Amanda was grateful they all had the opportunity to say goodbye to her before she slipped into quiet sleep. They arrived home late. “No wonder the boys look fatigued”, she thought. “It’s been a trying time for us all.” Amanda looked affectionately at her four boys as they hurriedly ate breakfast. Connor, at eighteen, was the oldest. He was what she called her feisty one. Until Coach Hastings at Upstate College had offered him a full athletic scholarship for next year, Connor had been lackadaisical in study habits and class attendance. Hastings was known as a no-nonsense coach who demanded the same effort in the classroom as he did on the football field. He also expected good citizenship from his players and those who could not stay out of trouble off the field needn’t worry about spending any time on it. Amanda had been pleased with the dramatic turnaround in her oldest son this year; Connor was doing everything he could to please both Coach Hastings and the faculty at Lee School. Caleb, sixteen years old, was her studious son. He was just finishing his sophomore year at Lee School and had maintained a perfect 4.0 grade average since commencing middle school. Caleb hoped to be a research scientist someday and possessed the analytical and perfectionist attitude that persons in that field must have to succeed. Amanda often worried about his over-developed sense of perfection as there had been times Caleb had overworked himself to his own detriment. Caleb would literally do anything to succeed. Caleb looked worried this morning, but, didn’t he always? Amanda hoped that his first hour gym class would perk him up—Wednesday tended to be a pop quiz day. Amanda considered Jordan, age fourteen. Jordan did not enjoy the robust health her other sons did. Jordan suffered from Hypoglycemia and it was no minor ailment with him, as he had been known to pass out at unexpected times. Amanda prayed that he would one day grow out of this. However, she took comfort in the fact that Jordan usually took pretty good care of himself. He watched carefully what he ate and drank, and monitored his exercise closely. Still, he could get dizzy and lightheaded at the oddest of times, especially when he overdid it. There had been several occasions in which the school nurse called, saying he arrived at school feeling weak and faint. The youngest was Kyle. Kyle was twelve and in his first year at Lee. Kyle was her current “problem” child. He was experiencing attention span problems and not doing too well in school. However, while Kyle was currently getting poor grades, he wasn’t a troublemaker—he had a healthy desire to get along with his teachers and the vice principal. Amanda wryly wished he had the same desire to get along with his report card. Her husband, Warren, had been like that when Kyle’s age, so she hoped it would not be a long term problem. Amanda continued to think of Kyle. Lee School was a place where an uninterested student could fail quickly. Pop quizzes, which were given frequently—usually either on Monday or Wednesday and often, both—carried as much weight as Friday tests and semester exams. This was of many reasons that Lee was the top school in the state, academically speaking. Amanda considered it fortunate that Lee was both a middle and high school. It was even better that the school was scarcely half a mile down the block from their home. Unless the weather was severely wet or cold, the boys walked together the short distance to school. She liked the fact that the path was well traveled, as many neighborhood children walked to school past their house. It was also well patrolled, as there were crossing guards at two key intersections, plus a police squad car that sat in the parking lot of the Elizabeth Toland Branch Library in the mornings and afternoons, monitoring both the behavior of the children and the street traffic. Amanda put all of her thoughts and cares behind her as she kissed each son goodbye. She watched them walk briskly down the sidewalk until out of sight. Stepping back into the house, she thought again, What a pretty day. During the middle of the morning, the telephone rang. It was Marge Schroeder, the Lee School receptionist. Marge knew Amanda well from Connor’s time as a habitual occupant of the vice principal’s office. She said, “Good morning, Amanda. One of your sons did not make it to first hour. We don’t know where he is” Amanda thought for a moment. Finally, she said to Marge, “I know who it was without you having to say. I’ll see you in a minute.” She told Marge who she suspected had skipped class and, before the startled Marge could answer, Amanda hung up and headed out the door.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First decide what the “crime” is.  \n   ­– The receptionist says: “One of your sons did not make it to first hour. We don’t know where he is.”  \n   ­– So the mystery is simply: Which boy failed to show up at school?\n\n2. Examine Motive.  \n   ­• Connor (18) now has a full-ride football scholarship that can be yanked if he cuts class or gets into trouble. He therefore has a very strong motive to be in every class.  \n   ­• Caleb (16) is obsessive about grades, has a 4.0 GPA, and literally “would do anything to succeed.” Missing a class—especially on a pop-quiz day—would endanger that average. Skipping makes no sense for him.  \n   ­• Jordan (14) is chronically hypoglycaemic. He may occasionally arrive at school feeling faint, but he tries hard to look after himself. If he collapsed on the way the school would quickly learn of it (crossing guards, police car, or other pupils would report it) and the office would know his whereabouts; they would not say “we don’t know where he is.”  \n   ­• Kyle (12) is the only son actually having academic trouble and who dreads the frequent Monday/Wednesday pop quizzes that count heavily. He lacks Connor’s scholarship incentive, Caleb’s perfectionism, or Jordan’s medical excuse. He is explicitly called Amanda’s “current ‘problem’ child.”\n\n3. Examine Opportunity.  \n   All four boys left the house together, but the half-mile walk gives anyone a chance to peel off once out of their mother’s sight. Only Kyle has both the motive and nothing pressing at school that would keep him on course.\n\n4. Consider Physical / circumstantial evidence.  \n   ­• The school knows Connor well from earlier misbehaviour and would probably have told Amanda if it were Connor.  \n   ­• If Jordan had had a hypoglycaemic episode the nurse or a passer-by would already have contacted the school; reception would know where he was.  \n   ­• Caleb’s first-hour teacher takes punctual gym attendance; a missing straight-A student would have been immediately sought out by name.  \n   ­• Kyle, being new to the school and not a troublemaker, would be the one the receptionist generically refers to as “one of your sons”—hence “we don’t know where he is.”\n\n5. Deduction.  \n   Amanda herself instantly knows which boy is absent and does not even let the receptionist identify him. Given her intimate knowledge of each son’s habits, the only boy she would immediately suspect of playing hooky is Kyle.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nConnor, Caleb, Jordan, Kyle\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nKyle\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAll four brothers left the house together for the short walk to Lee School. On this bright Wednesday, Kyle was dreading yet another pop quiz for which he was unprepared. Once he was far enough down the street to be out of Amanda’s line of sight—and while the older brothers were distracted in conversation—he lagged behind, then slipped away (most likely into the nearby library or another safe hiding place) and decided not to go to first-hour class at all. The older boys continued on and arrived at school on time. When first-hour roll was taken Kyle’s name was called and he was not present; the staff therefore telephoned home. Because skipping class fits Kyle’s recent pattern, Amanda immediately recognised that he must be the missing son and set off to find him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nConnor: His hard-won athletic scholarship and the coach’s strict rules mean he cannot afford a single unexcused absence. Skipping would jeopardise his entire future; moreover, the receptionist knows him well and would have mentioned his name.\n\nCaleb: A perfectionist with a flawless 4.0 GPA, who even worries about a gym-class pop quiz, would never miss class voluntarily. An absence would damage his record and cause unnecessary anxiety.\n\nJordan: If Jordan failed to arrive because of hypoglycaemia, someone (crossing guard, nurse, police officer, or another student) would have reported the medical incident. The school would therefore know his whereabouts; the receptionist’s statement that “we don’t know where he is” rules this out.\n\nHence only Kyle had both motive and opportunity, and Amanda’s instantaneous conclusion confirms it.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
