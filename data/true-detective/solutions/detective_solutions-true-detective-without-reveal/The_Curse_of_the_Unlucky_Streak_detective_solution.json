    "full_text": "The roar behind the pitcher told him what the crowd wanted: a strike. He could end this game now, in the bottom of the ninth inning, if he threw just one more strike. But instead he threw a pitch that the batter swung for, desperately. The ball sailed towards first base just outside the foul line—and a million eyes watched, knowing the game would end if only the first baseman caught it. “That was me,” Joe said, watching a replay on the restaurant’s television, five years later. The pitcher, Larry, sat beside him, watching the famous play again. It showed Joe running furiously, stretching with his glove as the camera zoomed in. Joe was perfectly positioned to make the catch, but somehow the ball whizzed past his glove, then bounced limply towards the wall. The next pitch, the batter doubled in two runs to win the game. “The bases were loaded,” muttered Larry, though they both remembered it perfectly well. Larry grabbed a handful of potato chips. His old first baseman, Joe, liked to meet on the anniversary of their last Major League game—the playoff game where they’d lost their chance to play in the World Series. They’d both retired after that loss. Their get-together this year to commemorate the day was especially poignant, as the following morning, their old stadium would be torn down. Each year they’d watch whatever game was on, and every so often the “historic highlights” would include their famous flubbed play. The TV show switched to footage of the announcers laughing at the play. “Talk about unlucky!” one fat sportscaster chuckled. Larry silently grabbed another handful of potato chips. “Does it ever bother you?” Joe asked. Larry stared back at him, then finally said, “No. Not anymore. Not since I heard about the coach’s wife and the legend of the million dollar mitts.” He washed down the potato chips, and then waited for Joe to agree. But Joe surprised him by saying he’d never met Mrs. Williams, and hadn’t heard the legend of the million dollar mitts. “Coach Williams loved the team—you know that. After we lost that game, I saw him getting on a bus for Texas. He was going to ride all night just to watch a college player who he thought might have potential for the next season. But his wife, Mrs. Williams, didn’t go with. She didn’t care about the team like he did. In fact, she was betting AGAINST us. And when I didn’t throw a strike, and you dropped that foul, she made a fortune.” “But gambling is illegal,” Joe said with horror. “Especially if you’re connected to the team! The coach could’ve lost his job and maybe even gone to prison!” “Mrs. Williams knew that,” Larry said. “She learned her lesson later that night, when the police surrounded her private cottage by the lake while everyone else was watching replays of the game. “Did she go to prison?” Joe asked. “They saw a gambler named Roderick arriving with a briefcase full of money. As soon as he’d left, they closed in and banged on her door. I always wondered who tipped them off, but somehow they knew she’d just received a million dollars due to betting on the game. “She finally opened the door,” Larry said, a sad look on his face. “But then they never found the money. All they found was a crate of the team’s baseball mitts that she was donating to a charity auction. The crate was sealed, and it looked like it couldn’t have been opened in the time after the police knocked on the door, so they assumed the money couldn’t be hidden inside. “The police chased after Roderick, and caught him within ten minutes. But when they came back Mrs. Williams was gone, and so was the crate.” “Mrs. Williams must’ve hidden the money inside!” Joe said. “But she never collected it,” Larry finished. “They caught up with her twenty minutes later, without the crate. They figured she’d hidden it, and planned to follow her for the next week. But she died in a bus accident the very next morning, as she was walking back to her house—she’d never learned how to drive. Wherever she hid that crate of baseball mitts, maybe the money is still sitting inside.” The fat announcer on TV looked like he was laughing at Joe again. “But one police officer overheard Mrs. Williams making a phone call that night,” Larry continued. “Unfortunately, he could only make out one sentence: The money’s buried at home.” “Was she talking about the place she lived with Coach Williams?” Joe asked. “She had her private cottage by the lake, but she and coach lived together in a big yellow house nearby, didn’t they?” “They searched the Coach’s house from top to bottom. And you can bet they searched for fresh holes, trying desperately to find the missing crate. But they never did.” “Maybe it wasn’t at the coach’s house,” a strange voice said behind them. They turned to see a thin man with long white hair and a smile on his face. The two ball players recognized him immediately. Five years ago, he’d painted the white lines on the baseball field. It was Gary, the groundskeeper. “You remember Gary, right?” Joe asked. “I invited him to meet us here tonight—poor guy can’t spend every night alone in that empty ballpark. And his timing is perfect! He can keep you company while I run home to check on my wife.” “But I know where the crate is!” said Gary. “I saw something strange that night, and now it all makes sense … “No one ever stayed late at the stadium, except sometimes Coach Williams. But around midnight that night, someone walked right through the locker room, lugging a huge crate. I didn’t see the person’s face, but the security guard told me he’d waved him in as someone he recognized. He was told that the crate was full of equipment to preserve the stadium’s dirt. That person walked straight across the diamond, and then dug up the ground near the batting cage.” “Don’t you see,” said Larry, excitedly. “They buried the money at home. Home plate!” “I’ve checked that field every night, and no one’s ever come around since to dig it up,” Gary continued. “Roderick was sent to jail the next week,” Larry added. “Once the police picked him up, they found he was wanted for other crimes.” The three men looked at each other for a moment. Then without saying a word, they all ran frantically out of the restaurant. “Let’s take my car!” shouted Gary. “No, let’s take mine,” said Joe, “I’ve got shovels!” At the stadium, at home base, the three men began digging furiously. The dirt was firm, but the men were determined, and dug deeper and deeper into the ground. Twenty minutes later, they’d found nothing. But then Joe’s shovel suddenly struck something in the ground that made a suspicious crunching sound. The three men moved to Joe’s side of the hole, and began digging again. It was a wooden surface, the long lid of a buried crate. They cleared away the dirt, and dug a few inches down the side. Without waiting, Gary wedged the shovel under the lid, and used its handle like a lever. The lid popped off, and the three men peered inside. There were twenty baseball mitts, like giant empty hands, now covered with stadium dirt. And next to the mitts was a pile of rectangular paper. Joe reached in and grabbed a handful. It was money: bundles and bundles of money. “And I’ve got some more good news,” said Larry. “I know who buried it here.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Start with the midnight burial.   \n • The security guard “waved him in as someone he recognised.”   \n • The visitor said the crate contained “equipment to preserve the stadium’s dirt.”  \n • Only a MALE already known around the club-house could have been waved straight through and be believed.  \n • Coach Williams was on a night bus to Texas.  \n • Roderick was being chased – he had no time.  \n • Gary the grounds-keeper was working in the park, not walking in with a crate big enough to need a guard’s permission.  \n • The only people left who fitted the guard’s description are the two retiring players: Larry the pitcher and Joe the first-baseman.  \n\n2. Eliminate Larry.  \n • Larry knows he did not go back to the park that night – and the whole mystery occurs because he himself is puzzled about where the money went.  \n • If Larry had buried the crate, he would hardly blurt out in the restaurant that he now “knows who buried it,” because that would be confessing.  \n • Nothing puts Larry anywhere except at home eating potato chips when the police were at the cottage.  \n\n3. Point at Joe.  \n • Joe alone invited Gary to the meeting: he needed the grounds-keeper along so he would have legitimate night-time access to the field when the three of them turned up with shovels.  \n • Joe suddenly “has to run home to check on my wife” just as Gary is about to describe what he saw that night – a classic ploy for a guilty man who wants to hear the story first from outside the room.  \n • When they race to the park Joe is the one who insists, “Let’s take my car – I’ve got shovels!”  Having shovels permanently in one’s car is convenient if you once used them to bury a crate.  \n • Out on the diamond, three men dig at random, yet it is Joe’s shovel that “just happens” to strike the lid in precisely the right spot – because he already knew the exact location.  \n • Larry’s instantaneous deduction at that moment is simple: only Larry or Joe could have been the man the guard waved through. Larry knows it was not himself, therefore it had to be Joe.  \n\n4. Motive.  \n • Joe had already profited from Mrs Williams’s bet by deliberately muffing the easy foul pop.  \n • With the police racing to the cottage Mrs Williams telephoned Joe (the officer overheard “The money’s buried at home”) to tell him what to do.  \n • Joe collected the mitt-filled crate, drove to the deserted ball-park, told the guard a quick story about “dirt-preserving equipment,” tramped straight to home plate/batting cage area, buried the box and left.  \n • When Mrs Williams died next morning Joe decided to leave the cash where it lay until demolition day, when the field would be empty and the risk of being caught minimal.  \n • All he needed then was an excuse to get back on the field for one last dig – hence the sentimental anniversary supper, the invitation to Gary, and the shovels already in his trunk.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJoe (former first-baseman), Larry (former pitcher), Gary (grounds-keeper), Coach Williams, Mrs Williams, Roderick (gambler), Security-guard\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJoe  – the retired first-baseman\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Before the play-off game Mrs Williams arranges an illegal bet against her husband’s club and cuts Joe in on the scheme.  \n• Larry, unaware of the plot, merely fails to throw a third strike; Joe deliberately drops the foul ball, ensuring the loss and the big pay-off.  \n• That night Roderick arrives at the lake cottage and hands over the million in a brief-case.  \n• To hide it quickly Mrs Williams stuffs the money into the charity-auction crate of nineteen spare mitts plus Joe’s own first-baseman’s mitt (the “million-dollar mitts”) and reseals it.  \n• Police arrive; they see only a sealed crate, then dash off after Roderick.  \n• Mrs Williams phones her accomplice: “The money’s buried at home.”  \n• Joe drives to the cottage, loads the crate, returns to the empty stadium.  \n• The security guard recognises him and waves him through. Joe claims the crate contains “equipment to preserve the stadium’s dirt,” walks across the diamond and buries it close to home plate.  \n• Mrs Williams is picked up without the crate. Before police can force her to show the hiding place she dies in the early-morning bus accident.  \n• Joe decides to wait until the ballpark’s final night to recover the money. He arranges the traditional reunion with Larry, invites Gary so they can get into the park, and brings pre-packed shovels.  \n• At the dig Joe leads them straight to the spot – but Larry’s quick mind sees what the coincidence really means and realises Joe must be the man who buried the crate.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Larry – knows he never left home that night and had no reason to lie down five untroubled years if he had.  \n• Gary – a night worker could have buried the crate, but if he had he would simply have dug it up long ago instead of patrolling the field “every night.”  \n• Coach Williams – was verifiably on a bus to Texas when the burial occurred.  \n• Mrs Williams – organised the betting but could not have been the male figure “recognised” by the guard, and she was on foot when arrested minutes later.  \n• Roderick – left the cottage and was in police custody ten minutes later.  \n• Security Guard – merely admitted a familiar face; no evidence he ever touched the crate.  \nThus the only person who both had the opportunity that night and a continuing need to keep the hiding-place secret is Joe, the former first-baseman.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

You even had shovels in your car!”\n“And he knew exactly where to dig,” added Gary.\n“You’re a crook,” Larry said, “but in a way, I’m relieved.

The next pitch, the batter doubled in two runs to win the game. “The bases were loaded,” muttered Larry, though they both remembered it perfectly well. Larry grabbed a handful of potato chips. His old first baseman, Joe, liked to meet on the anniversary of their last Major League game—the playoff game where they’d lost their chance to play in the World Series. They’d both retired after that loss. Their get-together this year to commemorate the day was especially poignant, as the following morning, their old stadium would be torn down. Each year they’d watch whatever game was on, and every so often the “historic highlights” would include their famous flubbed play. The TV show switched to footage of the announcers laughing at the play. “Talk about unlucky!” one fat sportscaster chuckled. Larry silently grabbed another handful of potato chips. “Does it ever bother you?” Joe asked. Larry stared back at him, then finally said, “No. Not anymore. Not since I heard about the coach’s wife and the legend of the million dollar mitts.” He washed down the potato chips, and then waited for Joe to agree. But Joe surprised him by saying he’d never met Mrs. Williams, and hadn’t heard the legend of the million dollar mitts. “Coach Williams loved the team—you know that. After we lost that game, I saw him getting on a bus for Texas. He was going to ride all night just to watch a college player who he thought might have potential for the next season. But his wife, Mrs. Williams, didn’t go with. She didn’t care about the team like he did. In fact, she was betting AGAINST us. And when I didn’t throw a strike, and you dropped that foul, she made a fortune.” “But gambling is illegal,” Joe said with horror. “Especially if you’re connected to the team! The coach could’ve lost his job and maybe even gone to prison!” “Mrs. Williams knew that,” Larry said. “She learned her lesson later that night, when the police surrounded her private cottage by the lake while everyone else was watching replays of the game. “Did she go to prison?” Joe asked. “They saw a gambler named Roderick arriving with a briefcase full of money. As soon as he’d left, they closed in and banged on her door. I always wondered who tipped them off, but somehow they knew she’d just received a million dollars due to betting on the game. “She finally opened the door,” Larry said, a sad look on his face. “But then they never found the money. All they found was a crate of the team’s baseball mitts that she was donating to a charity auction. The crate was sealed, and it looked like it couldn’t have been opened in the time after the police knocked on the door, so they assumed the money couldn’t be hidden inside. “The police chased after Roderick, and caught him within ten minutes. But when they came back Mrs. Williams was gone, and so was the crate.” “Mrs. Williams must’ve hidden the money inside!” Joe said. “But she never collected it,” Larry finished. “They caught up with her twenty minutes later, without the crate. They figured she’d hidden it, and planned to follow her for the next week. But she died in a bus accident the very next morning, as she was walking back to her house—she’d never learned how to drive. Wherever she hid that crate of baseball mitts, maybe the money is still sitting inside.” The fat announcer on TV looked like he was laughing at Joe again. “But one police officer overheard Mrs. Williams making a phone call that night,” Larry continued. “Unfortunately, he could only make out one sentence: The money’s buried at home.” “Was she talking about the place she lived with Coach Williams?” Joe asked. “She had her private cottage by the lake, but she and coach lived together in a big yellow house nearby, didn’t they?” “They searched the Coach’s house from top to bottom. And you can bet they searched for fresh holes, trying desperately to find the missing crate. But they never did.” “Maybe it wasn’t at the coach’s house,” a strange voice said behind them. They turned to see a thin man with long white hair and a smile on his face. The two ball players recognized him immediately. Five years ago, he’d painted the white lines on the baseball field. It was Gary, the groundskeeper. “You remember Gary, right?” Joe asked. “I invited him to meet us here tonight—poor guy can’t spend every night alone in that empty ballpark. And his timing is perfect! He can keep you company while I run home to check on my wife.” “But I know where the crate is!” said Gary. “I saw something strange that night, and now it all makes sense … “No one ever stayed late at the stadium, except sometimes Coach Williams. But around midnight that night, someone walked right through the locker room, lugging a huge crate. I didn’t see the person’s face, but the security guard told me he’d waved him in as someone he recognized. He was told that the crate was full of equipment to preserve the stadium’s dirt. That person walked straight across the diamond, and then dug up the ground near the batting cage.” “Don’t you see,” said Larry, excitedly. “They buried the money at home. Home plate!” “I’ve checked that field every night, and no one’s ever come around since to dig it up,” Gary continued. “Roderick was sent to jail the next week,” Larry added. “Once the police picked him up, they found he was wanted for other crimes.” The three men looked at each other for a moment. Then without saying a word, they all ran frantically out of the restaurant. “Let’s take my car!” shouted Gary. “No, let’s take mine,” said Joe, “I’ve got shovels!” At the stadium, at home base, the three men began digging furiously. The dirt was firm, but the men were determined, and dug deeper and deeper into the ground. Twenty minutes later, they’d found nothing. But then Joe’s shovel suddenly struck something in the ground that made a suspicious crunching sound. The three men moved to Joe’s side of the hole, and began digging again. It was a wooden surface, the long lid of a buried crate. They cleared away the dirt, and dug a few inches down the side. Without waiting, Gary wedged the shovel under the lid, and used its handle like a lever. The lid popped off, and the three men peered inside. There were twenty baseball mitts, like giant empty hands, now covered with stadium dirt. And next to the mitts was a pile of rectangular paper. Joe reached in and grabbed a handful. It was money: bundles and bundles of money. “And I’ve got some more good news,” said Larry. “I know who buried it here.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Coach Williams; (b) Joe; (c) Mrs. Williams; (d) Roderick",
      "answer": "(b) Joe",
      "outcome": "“Her accomplice was obviously Roderick,” Joe said.\n“It couldn’t have been—the security guard said it was someone he’d recognized,” Gary pointed out. “He wouldn’t have let a stranger like Roderick onto the field.”\n“Do you think it was Coach Williams?” Joe asked.\n“It couldn’t be our coach,” Larry said. “I told you I watched him catch a bus for Texas that same night. So he wouldn’t be around to bury the crate.”\n“But the guard would have recognized Mrs. Williams!” Joe suggested. “Maybe she did this alone!”\n“Mrs. Williams couldn’t drive,” Gary said. “So she couldn’t deliver that crate from her cottage to the stadium.”\n“But then who?” asked Joe.\n“I said I’d always wondered who tipped off the police,” said Larry. “Roderick or Mrs. Williams wouldn’t want that. Someone else must’ve been involved in their bet.\n“And I always wondered why she’d bet so much in the first place. Unless her accomplice was going to make sure she won.”\nJoe stood up straight and puffed up his chest. “Are you accusing me of dropping that ball on purpose?”\n“That was the first clue. But tonight, the last night before they tear down the stadium, you invited the man who watches the grounds to join us—for the first time since we started our yearly get-together—at the restaurant, and then tried to leave as soon as he arrived. You even had shovels in your car!”\n“And he knew exactly where to dig,” added Gary.\n“You’re a crook,” Larry said, “but in a way, I’m relieved. Every night for the last five years, I’ve felt guilty that the team lost that game. But now I know why.”\nJoe stared back with a guilty smile, and said, “I guess my unlucky streak isn’t over yet.”"
