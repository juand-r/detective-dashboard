    "full_text": "The roar behind the pitcher told him what the crowd wanted: a strike. He could end this game now, in the bottom of the ninth inning, if he threw just one more strike. But instead he threw a pitch that the batter swung for, desperately. The ball sailed towards first base just outside the foul line—and a million eyes watched, knowing the game would end if only the first baseman caught it. “That was me,” Joe said, watching a replay on the restaurant’s television, five years later. The pitcher, Larry, sat beside him, watching the famous play again. It showed Joe running furiously, stretching with his glove as the camera zoomed in. Joe was perfectly positioned to make the catch, but somehow the ball whizzed past his glove, then bounced limply towards the wall. The next pitch, the batter doubled in two runs to win the game. “The bases were loaded,” muttered Larry, though they both remembered it perfectly well. Larry grabbed a handful of potato chips. His old first baseman, Joe, liked to meet on the anniversary of their last Major League game—the playoff game where they’d lost their chance to play in the World Series. They’d both retired after that loss. Their get-together this year to commemorate the day was especially poignant, as the following morning, their old stadium would be torn down. Each year they’d watch whatever game was on, and every so often the “historic highlights” would include their famous flubbed play. The TV show switched to footage of the announcers laughing at the play. “Talk about unlucky!” one fat sportscaster chuckled. Larry silently grabbed another handful of potato chips. “Does it ever bother you?” Joe asked. Larry stared back at him, then finally said, “No. Not anymore. Not since I heard about the coach’s wife and the legend of the million dollar mitts.” He washed down the potato chips, and then waited for Joe to agree. But Joe surprised him by saying he’d never met Mrs. Williams, and hadn’t heard the legend of the million dollar mitts. “Coach Williams loved the team—you know that. After we lost that game, I saw him getting on a bus for Texas. He was going to ride all night just to watch a college player who he thought might have potential for the next season. But his wife, Mrs. Williams, didn’t go with. She didn’t care about the team like he did. In fact, she was betting AGAINST us. And when I didn’t throw a strike, and you dropped that foul, she made a fortune.” “But gambling is illegal,” Joe said with horror. “Especially if you’re connected to the team! The coach could’ve lost his job and maybe even gone to prison!” “Mrs. Williams knew that,” Larry said. “She learned her lesson later that night, when the police surrounded her private cottage by the lake while everyone else was watching replays of the game. “Did she go to prison?” Joe asked. “They saw a gambler named Roderick arriving with a briefcase full of money. As soon as he’d left, they closed in and banged on her door. I always wondered who tipped them off, but somehow they knew she’d just received a million dollars due to betting on the game. “She finally opened the door,” Larry said, a sad look on his face. “But then they never found the money. All they found was a crate of the team’s baseball mitts that she was donating to a charity auction. The crate was sealed, and it looked like it couldn’t have been opened in the time after the police knocked on the door, so they assumed the money couldn’t be hidden inside. “The police chased after Roderick, and caught him within ten minutes. But when they came back Mrs. Williams was gone, and so was the crate.” “Mrs. Williams must’ve hidden the money inside!” Joe said. “But she never collected it,” Larry finished. “They caught up with her twenty minutes later, without the crate. They figured she’d hidden it, and planned to follow her for the next week. But she died in a bus accident the very next morning, as she was walking back to her house—she’d never learned how to drive. Wherever she hid that crate of baseball mitts, maybe the money is still sitting inside.” The fat announcer on TV looked like he was laughing at Joe again. “But one police officer overheard Mrs. Williams making a phone call that night,” Larry continued. “Unfortunately, he could only make out one sentence: The money’s buried at home.” “Was she talking about the place she lived with Coach Williams?” Joe asked. “She had her private cottage by the lake, but she and coach lived together in a big yellow house nearby, didn’t they?” “They searched the Coach’s house from top to bottom. And you can bet they searched for fresh holes, trying desperately to find the missing crate. But they never did.” “Maybe it wasn’t at the coach’s house,” a strange voice said behind them. They turned to see a thin man with long white hair and a smile on his face. The two ball players recognized him immediately. Five years ago, he’d painted the white lines on the baseball field. It was Gary, the groundskeeper. “You remember Gary, right?” Joe asked. “I invited him to meet us here tonight—poor guy can’t spend every night alone in that empty ballpark. And his timing is perfect! He can keep you company while I run home to check on my wife.” “But I know where the crate is!” said Gary. “I saw something strange that night, and now it all makes sense … “No one ever stayed late at the stadium, except sometimes Coach Williams. But around midnight that night, someone walked right through the locker room, lugging a huge crate. I didn’t see the person’s face, but the security guard told me he’d waved him in as someone he recognized. He was told that the crate was full of equipment to preserve the stadium’s dirt. That person walked straight across the diamond, and then dug up the ground near the batting cage.” “Don’t you see,” said Larry, excitedly. “They buried the money at home. Home plate!” “I’ve checked that field every night, and no one’s ever come around since to dig it up,” Gary continued. “Roderick was sent to jail the next week,” Larry added. “Once the police picked him up, they found he was wanted for other crimes.” The three men looked at each other for a moment. Then without saying a word, they all ran frantically out of the restaurant. “Let’s take my car!” shouted Gary. “No, let’s take mine,” said Joe, “I’ve got shovels!” At the stadium, at home base, the three men began digging furiously. The dirt was firm, but the men were determined, and dug deeper and deeper into the ground. Twenty minutes later, they’d found nothing. But then Joe’s shovel suddenly struck something in the ground that made a suspicious crunching sound. The three men moved to Joe’s side of the hole, and began digging again. It was a wooden surface, the long lid of a buried crate. They cleared away the dirt, and dug a few inches down the side. Without waiting, Gary wedged the shovel under the lid, and used its handle like a lever. The lid popped off, and the three men peered inside. There were twenty baseball mitts, like giant empty hands, now covered with stadium dirt. And next to the mitts was a pile of rectangular paper. Joe reached in and grabbed a handful. It was money: bundles and bundles of money. “And I’ve got some more good news,” said Larry. “I know who buried it here.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who actually profited from hiding the money?  \n   • Mrs. Williams and the gambler Roderick were the ones who received the million-dollar payoff, but Mrs. Williams needed a quick, safe hiding place when the police arrived.  \n   • She could not drive, could not move a heavy crate far on foot, and had only the brief interval while the police were chasing Roderick.  \n   • Therefore she had to pass the crate to someone who (a) lived or worked very close-by, (b) could enter the locked ball-park in the middle of the night without raising suspicion, and (c) would know exactly how to “take care of the stadium’s dirt.”\n\n2. Who fits those conditions?  \n   • Gary the groundskeeper.  \n     – The security guard “waved him in as someone he recognised.”  \n     – The story told the guard was that the crate contained “equipment to preserve the stadium’s dirt,” something only a groundskeeper would plausibly say.  \n     – Digging holes in the infield at midnight would look normal only for the man in charge of the turf.  \n   • No one would have believed that explanation from a player (Joe or Larry) or from Coach Williams (who was on a bus to Texas).\n\n3. Behaviour on the night of the restaurant meeting.  \n   • Gary suddenly appears, says he “knows where the crate is,” and is frantic to reach the park on the very last night before the stadium is demolished – his last safe chance to reclaim the loot he buried himself.  \n   • He tries to keep control of the transportation (“Let’s take my car!”) – he wants to direct events and, once the money is in his hands, presumably lose the others.  \n   • He has allegedly “checked the field every night” for five years.  Someone who merely *saw* the crate buried would long ago have dug it up.  Only the man who *buried* it would leave it there until he felt it was safe.\n\n4. What Larry suddenly realises at the hole.  \n   • Once the lid comes off and the mitts and money are revealed, Larry mentally reviews Gary’s story and notes the key fact:  \n     – Only a groundskeeper could have walked straight onto the field with a shovel and a crate of “dirt-preserving equipment” and been waved through.  \n   • That is why Larry says, “I know who buried it here.”  He has just put all the pieces together; the only possible digger is the man standing beside him – Gary.\n\nTherefore the person who physically hid the crate – the culprit Larry means – is Gary the groundskeeper.  Mrs. Williams and Roderick were his conspirators, but they are not the ones Larry is about to name; Mrs. Williams is dead and Roderick is in jail.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGary the groundskeeper, Joe the first-baseman, Larry the pitcher, Coach Williams, Mrs Williams (deceased), Roderick the gambler\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nGary  (groundskeeper; surname not given)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nMrs. Williams, Roderick\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Five years ago Mrs. Williams bet heavily against her husband’s team, collecting one million dollars from the gambler Roderick after Joe’s mis-played foul ball helped lose the game.  \n•  While police were chasing Roderick, Mrs. Williams slipped out of her lakeside cottage with the sealed “charity” crate and hurried to the stadium.  \n•  She had already phoned her confederate, Gary the groundskeeper: “The money’s buried at home.”  “Home” was coded baseball talk for home plate.  \n•  Gary, recognised by the night security guard, carried the crate across the diamond, dug a hole near the batting cage/home plate area, and buried it.  His cover story—that the crate held material for preserving stadium dirt—was completely believable coming from the man in charge of the field.  \n•  Mrs. Williams was picked up a little later without the crate; the police never connected Gary to the scheme.  She died in an accident next morning, taking the secret with her.  \n•  Gary, physically slight and afraid of being seen with a huge crate of cash, decided to let the money lie undisturbed until suspicion cooled.  He watched the field nightly to be sure no one else tried to dig it up.  \n•  On the eve of the stadium’s demolition, he turned up at the restaurant and lured Joe and Larry to help excavate, planning to claim or divide the money once it was in hand.  \n•  At the dig, the clues finally snap together for Larry: the guard’s recognition, the dirt-equipment alibi, and Gary’s obsessive monitoring of the diamond.  Larry realises Gary himself buried the crate.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Joe – His having shovels in the car is suspicious but not conclusive; nothing else ties him to the burial, and the security guard’s “dirt-equipment” story makes no sense coming from a first-baseman.  \n• Larry – He was on the pitching mound when the foul occurred and left town after the season; no opportunity or motive is shown for him to help Mrs. Williams.  \n• Coach Williams – He was on an overnight bus to Texas scouting a prospect when the money was hidden.  \n• Mrs. Williams – Mastermind of the betting scheme, but she did not do the burying; she relied on Gary and is now deceased.  \n• Roderick – Financier of the fix, arrested later; likewise never had the opportunity to enter the park and dig.  \nThus only Gary satisfies motive, means, opportunity, and the eyewitness/security-guard clues.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

The next pitch, the batter doubled in two runs to win the game. “The bases were loaded,” muttered Larry, though they both remembered it perfectly well. Larry grabbed a handful of potato chips. His old first baseman, Joe, liked to meet on the anniversary of their last Major League game—the playoff game where they’d lost their chance to play in the World Series. They’d both retired after that loss. Their get-together this year to commemorate the day was especially poignant, as the following morning, their old stadium would be torn down. Each year they’d watch whatever game was on, and every so often the “historic highlights” would include their famous flubbed play. The TV show switched to footage of the announcers laughing at the play. “Talk about unlucky!” one fat sportscaster chuckled. Larry silently grabbed another handful of potato chips. “Does it ever bother you?” Joe asked. Larry stared back at him, then finally said, “No. Not anymore. Not since I heard about the coach’s wife and the legend of the million dollar mitts.” He washed down the potato chips, and then waited for Joe to agree. But Joe surprised him by saying he’d never met Mrs. Williams, and hadn’t heard the legend of the million dollar mitts. “Coach Williams loved the team—you know that. After we lost that game, I saw him getting on a bus for Texas. He was going to ride all night just to watch a college player who he thought might have potential for the next season. But his wife, Mrs. Williams, didn’t go with. She didn’t care about the team like he did. In fact, she was betting AGAINST us. And when I didn’t throw a strike, and you dropped that foul, she made a fortune.” “But gambling is illegal,” Joe said with horror. “Especially if you’re connected to the team! The coach could’ve lost his job and maybe even gone to prison!” “Mrs. Williams knew that,” Larry said. “She learned her lesson later that night, when the police surrounded her private cottage by the lake while everyone else was watching replays of the game. “Did she go to prison?” Joe asked. “They saw a gambler named Roderick arriving with a briefcase full of money. As soon as he’d left, they closed in and banged on her door. I always wondered who tipped them off, but somehow they knew she’d just received a million dollars due to betting on the game. “She finally opened the door,” Larry said, a sad look on his face. “But then they never found the money. All they found was a crate of the team’s baseball mitts that she was donating to a charity auction. The crate was sealed, and it looked like it couldn’t have been opened in the time after the police knocked on the door, so they assumed the money couldn’t be hidden inside. “The police chased after Roderick, and caught him within ten minutes. But when they came back Mrs. Williams was gone, and so was the crate.” “Mrs. Williams must’ve hidden the money inside!” Joe said. “But she never collected it,” Larry finished. “They caught up with her twenty minutes later, without the crate. They figured she’d hidden it, and planned to follow her for the next week. But she died in a bus accident the very next morning, as she was walking back to her house—she’d never learned how to drive. Wherever she hid that crate of baseball mitts, maybe the money is still sitting inside.” The fat announcer on TV looked like he was laughing at Joe again. “But one police officer overheard Mrs. Williams making a phone call that night,” Larry continued. “Unfortunately, he could only make out one sentence: The money’s buried at home.” “Was she talking about the place she lived with Coach Williams?” Joe asked. “She had her private cottage by the lake, but she and coach lived together in a big yellow house nearby, didn’t they?” “They searched the Coach’s house from top to bottom. And you can bet they searched for fresh holes, trying desperately to find the missing crate. But they never did.” “Maybe it wasn’t at the coach’s house,” a strange voice said behind them. They turned to see a thin man with long white hair and a smile on his face. The two ball players recognized him immediately. Five years ago, he’d painted the white lines on the baseball field. It was Gary, the groundskeeper. “You remember Gary, right?” Joe asked. “I invited him to meet us here tonight—poor guy can’t spend every night alone in that empty ballpark. And his timing is perfect! He can keep you company while I run home to check on my wife.” “But I know where the crate is!” said Gary. “I saw something strange that night, and now it all makes sense … “No one ever stayed late at the stadium, except sometimes Coach Williams. But around midnight that night, someone walked right through the locker room, lugging a huge crate. I didn’t see the person’s face, but the security guard told me he’d waved him in as someone he recognized. He was told that the crate was full of equipment to preserve the stadium’s dirt. That person walked straight across the diamond, and then dug up the ground near the batting cage.” “Don’t you see,” said Larry, excitedly. “They buried the money at home. Home plate!” “I’ve checked that field every night, and no one’s ever come around since to dig it up,” Gary continued. “Roderick was sent to jail the next week,” Larry added. “Once the police picked him up, they found he was wanted for other crimes.” The three men looked at each other for a moment. Then without saying a word, they all ran frantically out of the restaurant. “Let’s take my car!” shouted Gary. “No, let’s take mine,” said Joe, “I’ve got shovels!” At the stadium, at home base, the three men began digging furiously. The dirt was firm, but the men were determined, and dug deeper and deeper into the ground. Twenty minutes later, they’d found nothing. But then Joe’s shovel suddenly struck something in the ground that made a suspicious crunching sound. The three men moved to Joe’s side of the hole, and began digging again. It was a wooden surface, the long lid of a buried crate. They cleared away the dirt, and dug a few inches down the side. Without waiting, Gary wedged the shovel under the lid, and used its handle like a lever. The lid popped off, and the three men peered inside. There were twenty baseball mitts, like giant empty hands, now covered with stadium dirt. And next to the mitts was a pile of rectangular paper. Joe reached in and grabbed a handful. It was money: bundles and bundles of money. “And I’ve got some more good news,” said Larry. “I know who buried it here.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Coach Williams; (b) Joe; (c) Mrs. Williams; (d) Roderick",
      "answer": "(b) Joe",
      "outcome": "“Her accomplice was obviously Roderick,” Joe said.\n“It couldn’t have been—the security guard said it was someone he’d recognized,” Gary pointed out. “He wouldn’t have let a stranger like Roderick onto the field.”\n“Do you think it was Coach Williams?” Joe asked.\n“It couldn’t be our coach,” Larry said. “I told you I watched him catch a bus for Texas that same night. So he wouldn’t be around to bury the crate.”\n“But the guard would have recognized Mrs. Williams!” Joe suggested. “Maybe she did this alone!”\n“Mrs. Williams couldn’t drive,” Gary said. “So she couldn’t deliver that crate from her cottage to the stadium.”\n“But then who?” asked Joe.\n“I said I’d always wondered who tipped off the police,” said Larry. “Roderick or Mrs. Williams wouldn’t want that. Someone else must’ve been involved in their bet.\n“And I always wondered why she’d bet so much in the first place. Unless her accomplice was going to make sure she won.”\nJoe stood up straight and puffed up his chest. “Are you accusing me of dropping that ball on purpose?”\n“That was the first clue. But tonight, the last night before they tear down the stadium, you invited the man who watches the grounds to join us—for the first time since we started our yearly get-together—at the restaurant, and then tried to leave as soon as he arrived. You even had shovels in your car!”\n“And he knew exactly where to dig,” added Gary.\n“You’re a crook,” Larry said, “but in a way, I’m relieved. Every night for the last five years, I’ve felt guilty that the team lost that game. But now I know why.”\nJoe stared back with a guilty smile, and said, “I guess my unlucky streak isn’t over yet.”"
