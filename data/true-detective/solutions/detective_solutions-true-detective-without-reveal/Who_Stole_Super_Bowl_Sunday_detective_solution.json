    "full_text": "John Elway grabbed the center's snap. His guard blocked the tackles while Elway searched desperately for an open receiver. Suddenly, he spotted Smith breaking across the field. Elway hurtled a long pass down the field. Completion! Elway huddled with the team, and decided to try a handoff. Ignoring the crowd, he focused only on his team, the ball, and the chosen play. The center snapped the ball, and Elway turned for the hand-off and hoped for the best. Touchdown! Uncle Charlie could describe the whole game as though he'd played it himself. “That was his last game,” Charlie said. “After 14 years, Elway had played in four Super Bowl games, and he'd lost every year. Then he came back one more time, just to prove that he could win the big game again. He was the only quarterback who ever started in five Super Bowl games.” “And the only man you ever loved more than me,” teased Aunt Mary. Uncle Charlie laughed. His passion was watching professional football, and this year he'd bought himself a widescreen TV just for watching his favorite team, the Denver Broncos. Even though they didn't make it into the post-season playoff games this year, Charlie never missed a chance to watch the Super Bowl; even if it was only so he could compare the teams' quarterbacks to John Elway! He'd invited me to watch his first widescreen Super Bowl — which was a relief. Eight years earlier, when I was seven years old, my parents had taken me for my first visit to Uncle Charlie’s. Running through his living room, screaming about imaginary monsters, I had crashed into the cabinet with his TV set. The cabinet toppled forward, and I watched in horror as the front of the TV smashed to the ground. So today I was relieved that Uncle Charlie let me anywhere near his expensive new television! “It arrived yesterday,” Charlie said, pointing to the enormous plastic cover that he'd unwrapped from the screen when Phil, the burly delivery man, set it up. “They'd set it up in the guest cottage out back; but for the big game, I decided it looked better in my den. The picture is spectacular! The teams are going to look huge!” But as Uncle Charlie opened the door to his den, we were greeted by a terrible surprise. His television was gone! Sunday sunshine poured into the empty space in the room through its only other door, which stood wide open. Charlie rushed through the door, and the neighbor's dog began barking fiercely. The dog stood behind a fence barely four feet away. To the right, the fence joined Uncle Charlie's house, so there was only one other way to travel with the TV: left towards the street! “Darn it,” Charlie said, since he couldn't avoid stepping in the enormous puddle of mud around the door. We looked for muddy tracks towards the street, but there weren't any. “Someone escaped with my TV — and without leaving us a clue!” Charlie wailed. I hated to see my uncle so unhappy, but every problem is also an opportunity. If I could deduce who'd stole his TV, it'd more than make up for the one I'd destroyed when I was seven — once and for all! Maybe I was like John Elway in Super Bowl XXXIII because I, too, had something to prove. “Who knew you had a widescreen TV?” I asked Charlie. \"You said you've only had your TV since yesterday! “That's right!” said Charlie excitedly. “Maybe we'll solve this yet.” He thought for a moment, then said, “My neighbor Rick! Sometimes he teases me that I care too much about football. I'd invited him over to see the new screen yesterday. Maybe he came back and grabbed it as a practical joke. “Uncle Charlie grabbed his winter jacket from the hook on the wall, and then we walked next door to pay a visit on Rick. When we rang Rick's bell, he surprised us by opening the door in a football jersey — the one he'd worn as a college football player. “I never got tackled!” Rick liked to brag —mainly because he'd spent the entire season sitting on the bench. They'd called him “Rick the Brick” because he weighed 240 pounds; though, maybe they'd also thought he was dumb as a brick. “I'm undefeated!” Rick shouted, opening the door. In his living room was a regular 13-inch TV screen, where he was obviously planning to watch the game. But Rick looked even more like a football player today for another reason. “What happened to your arm?” Charlie asked. Rick's face turned bright red. “I was throwing some passes with my nephew last night, and I tripped on a sprinkler and broke my arm,\" he said sadly, lifting a white plaster cast held in place by a sling around his neck. He showed us the autographs he'd gotten on the cast from the staff at the hospital. Rick didn't have a lot of other friends. “Did you see anyone strange approaching my house?” Charlie asked. Rick shook his head no, but he also said that he'd been sleeping for most of the morning. Looking at Rick's own set, we realized the game was about to start. Uncle Charlie quickly said good-bye, leaving Rick to his one-man Super Bowl party. But on the way out, Uncle Charlie got an idea: “There's one other person who knew I had the TV,” he pointed out: “Phil the delivery man! Do you think there's any chance he came back here this morning and grabbed it for himself? He's big enough to carry it off — and it'd be an easy way for him to sell the same TV twice!” We saw Aunt Mary waiting for us as we approached the house. “Maybe Uncle Charlie's just teasing you,” Aunt Mary suggested. “Is there any evidence that he even had a TV here? And suddenly the answer hit me. “I can solve the mystery of the missing TV!” I told Uncle Charlie. “And I'll do it before the game even starts!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First I drew a map in my head.  \n   • The den has only two exits: the door we entered from the hall and the outside door that opens almost directly onto the neighbour’s fence.  \n   • To get any large object out of the den and away from the house you must go through that outside door, turn left (the fence joins the house on the right) and walk past the barking dog toward the street.\n\n2. Next I looked at what would inevitably be left behind if a heavy, wide–screen set really had been carried out that way this morning.  \n   • Around the outside door is “an enormous puddle of mud.”  \n   • Anyone large enough to carry a 40- or 50-inch set would have to step in that mud, and the weight of the set would push his shoes deep enough to leave clear, unmistakable footprints.  \n   • Because the only way out is toward the street, there would have to be a line of muddy tracks leading that way.\n\n3. But we already have the crucial fact: “We looked for muddy tracks towards the street, but there weren’t any.”  \n   • No tracks = no one carried a TV out through that door.  \n   • And there is no other exit big enough to move the set.  \n   • Therefore the set never left through that door at all.\n\n4. So where is it?  Uncle Charlie himself told us that when the delivery man set it up yesterday it was put “in the guest cottage out back.”  Charlie “decided it looked better in my den,” but there is absolutely no evidence that he ever got around to moving it—only that he carried the light, floppy plastic dust-cover into the house.\n\n5. There is a perfectly simple explanation that fits every fact and requires no thief at all:  \n   • The television is still sitting exactly where Phil left it yesterday—in the guest cottage.  \n   • Charlie forgot that he had not yet lugged it into the den, saw the empty space and the open door, and jumped to the wrong conclusion.\n\n6. This also explains the “open” door and the barking dog.  Charlie probably opened that door himself earlier in the morning (or even yesterday evening) when he was measuring or planning his move, then forgot to close it.  When he rushed out today the dog naturally began barking at the sudden movement.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRick (the neighbour), Phil (the delivery man), Aunt Mary, the narrator, Uncle Charlie\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nUncle Charlie (Charles “Uncle Charlie” —his own forgetfulness)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Saturday: Phil delivers the new widescreen TV and installs it in the guest cottage.  Charlie removes the big plastic shipping cover and later carries that cover into the house, planning to move the set itself into the den before Sunday’s game.\n\n2. Sunday morning: Caught up in Super-Bowl excitement, Charlie assumes he has already moved the set.  He walks his nephew to the den, opens the door, sees an empty space and an outside door he himself left standing open, and immediately believes the TV has been stolen.\n\n3. Because the only escape route is across a muddy puddle—yet there are no footprints—nothing was carried out.  The television is still safe in the guest cottage; only Charlie’s memory fumbled the “handoff.”\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Rick: With a freshly broken, plaster-covered arm he could not carry a huge screen.  More importantly, no one, broken arm or not, could have walked away with the set without leaving muddy tracks.  \n\n• Phil the delivery man: He hasn’t been back since yesterday, and the mud shows no sign of any large object being moved this morning.  \n\n• Aunt Mary: She is outside when we return, wearing clean shoes—again, no mud.  And she raises the logical question of whether there was ever a TV in the den at all, pointing us toward the real solution.  \n\n• The narrator: Small, has no motive, and has just arrived with Uncle Charlie; could not have staged the disappearance.\n\nThe only “culprit” is Uncle Charlie’s own faulty memory.  The missing widescreen is not missing at all—just still sitting happily in the guest cottage waiting for kickoff. </WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I don't really think you love football more than you love me.”\n“You know I don't,” Charlie said fondly. “In fact, to prove it, why don't we skip the game altogether. Today's the one day we can have the park all to ourselves, because everyone else will be staying home, watching television!\"\nMary blushed with excitement, but she wanted Charlie to be happy. “Are you sure?” she asked. “Don't you want to stay home and watch the big game?

      "outcome": "“Uncle Charlie's not telling a fib,\" I told Aunt Mary. \"I know there was a TV here, because I saw its enormous plastic cover!”\n“I bet Rick would love watching the game on my giant screen,” Uncle Charlie speculated.\n“But Rick's arm is in a cast!” I pointed out. “Even if he'd wanted to steal your TV, he wouldn't be able to carry it to his house.”\n\"What about Phil, the delivery man?\" Uncle Charlie asked. “Do you think he came back and stole the TV he'd just delivered?”\n“It couldn't be Phil the Delivery man,” I said. “He delivered the TV to your guest cottage. So even if he'd wanted to steal your set, he'd never have known that you'd moved it into your den!”\nThe game was going to start in less than two minutes, but I wasn't worried. “There's one more reason it couldn't be Phil or Rick,” I announced: “Even if they were able to squeeze the TV into that four-foot opening by the fence, and without anyone hearing the barking dogs, they'd still have to walk through that giant puddle — and leave some muddy footprints.”\n“But there weren't any!” said Uncle Charlie. “It's as though the TV ... never left the room!” laughed Aunt Mary. “I just hid it behind the curtain on the other side of the room. It's still plugged in. If you hurry, you can still catch the coin toss.”\nUncle Charlie laughed. “Do you hate my football games that much?”\n“Of course not,” said Mary. “It was just too good a joke to pass up. I don't really think you love football more than you love me.”\n“You know I don't,” Charlie said fondly. “In fact, to prove it, why don't we skip the game altogether. Today's the one day we can have the park all to ourselves, because everyone else will be staying home, watching television!\"\nMary blushed with excitement, but she wanted Charlie to be happy. “Are you sure?” she asked. “Don't you want to stay home and watch the big game? After all, it's the Super Bowl!”\n“Nah,” said Uncle Charlie. “John Elway isn't even playing!”"
