    "full_text": "Peter came bursting in the door, his tricorn hat falling off as he shouted: “Someone has stolen the new cannon, right out from under the guards’ noses.” John Webster, Peter's father, emerged from his office into the entryway still holding the feather quill and bill of lading he had been checking. He was wearing the new bifocal glasses that Benjamin Franklin had recently invented. He reached up and smoothed his brown hair, which like most men and boys of the time was bound behind the neck and reached his shoulders. “Who do they think took it?” he asked. Peter, who was a miniature of his father except for having red hair, tried to keep the details straight as he answered: “Well, Constable Barnes says that there are four suspects already and that he is pretty sure that at least one of them is guilty.” Peter's father walked over to the window that looked over the loading dock and wondered aloud: “How could they have removed that enormous weight without someone noticing or hearing something?” The Boston streets were packed with people talking about the brazen theft. Peter's mother Anna and little sister Emma were walking over the cobblestones toward him, their blond hair peeking out from beneath their frilly white caps. “Where's your father?” his mother asked. Peter turned and pointed to a group of men talking quietly by the ship emblazoned with the name “Resolve” painted on its prow. “He's talking to the constable about the men who have been arrested,” Peter explained. “Are they anyone that we know?” Emma asked. “Yes, all of them are local people except for Captain Parker, and he's been in and out of the harbor many times; and father's company has dealt with him for many years,\" Peter responded. “Bob Turkle, the blacksmith, Tom Wise, the fishmonger, and Paul Rhodes, the baker, are the other suspects, but so far nobody has told how it happened,” Peter said. The crime was simple enough. The new experimental long-range cannon, developed and cast in France, was shipped topside because of ease of loading and removal. Sometime last night, when it was high tide, some person or persons had taken it. A cannon of this length and weight should require several dockworkers using block and tackle to remove it. Block and tackle, being notorious for making noise, and the light needed for the delicate operation, would make secrecy seemingly impossible. Also, two trusted guards had paced the docks all night and had seen nothing unusual. There were derricks hanging out over the water at intervals, but none of them were rigged. How did they do it? Peter walked over and listened to his father and the constable as they quietly discussed what the suspects had told them. Captain Parker had been aboard all night and had heard nothing. Dressed all in black, including hair and beard, he seemed to be a giant. “Look, constable, you came down here yourself and looked at the cannon and so did Mr. Webster, who signed my docking papers,” he said. “I was paid to deliver the cannon to the dock and that is what I did. Now let me go about my business,” he said firmly. “Well, you were three weeks late and now you're in a hurry,” said the constable, looking the captain in the eye. “Give us one more hour and then you can begin unloading.” Bob Turkle, a burly man with large, muscular arms, who was a fervent patriot, was next to be questioned. The guards had talked to him about an hour before daylight on the dock. This was before the theft of the cannon was discovered. He always arose before dawn to start the fire in his forge. After performing this task, he walked down to the docks to check on a load of pig iron that Captain Parker had agreed to bring with the cannon. Pig iron is a common metal, often in brick shapes, used by blacksmiths to make metal items. “Captain Parker often brings my iron for me and this time he gave me a break in price because he was docking here to deliver the cannon,” Bob said. Tom Wise and Paul Rhodes, the fishmonger and baker, were suspects because they were king's men and had been heard threatening to sink the Resolve. “Aye, I’m a loyalist,” the small-framed Wise admitted proudly, “but I’m no thief.” The baker was no less outspoken. “Everyone knows I’m for King George,” Rhodes said, raising his voice and standing up despite his limp. “The patriots are making a mess of things and are going to bring us to ruination. But I don’t have yer gun. And if I did, where would I put it, my bakery?” he said, sneering. Peter, John and the constable then inspected the ship but found it empty except for the enormous stack of iron running along the keel. It was covered with an oil-impregnated cloth to keep the salt air from rusting it. They raised the cloth to get a better look and stared at the iron bricks. When they returned to the dock the hour was almost up. Peter went over to his father who was staring at the bow of the ship, trying to figure out the enigma. “Father, what are those roman numerals going down the side of the bow?” Peter asked. \n“What? Oh, those tell how deep in the water the ship is laden,” he said. He did a double take. John Webster suddenly turned and looked at Peter with a great smile on his face. “Peter, I think you have solved the mystery,” he said. “Give me two minutes in my office and I'll tell you for sure.” When John Webster returned he said to his son: “The ship was as deep in the water as it was yesterday.” Webster announced to the crowd: “I know where the cannon is and who took it.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive\n   • Tom Wise and Paul Rhodes are Loyalists; they opposed the patriots but had nothing to gain from a single experimental French cannon – and absolutely nowhere to hide it.  \n   • Bob Turkle is a fervent patriot who wants the colonies to have strong arms, not deprive them of one.  \n   • Captain Parker alone could turn the cannon into quick money: sell it to the British, to a privateer, or simply pocket the freight and the gun itself. He was three weeks late with his cargo, is suddenly “in a hurry,” and wants to cast off as soon as possible.\n\n2. Opportunity\n   • The only place large enough to conceal a three-ton cannon within the time window is the very ship that brought it.  \n   • Only Captain Parker (and his crew) had unobstructed, unsupervised access to the Resolve all night.  \n   • Bob Turkle was seen on the dock, not aboard the vessel; Wise and Rhodes never came near the ship.\n\n3. Physical evidence / alibis\n   • Derricks on the dock were not rigged and the guards heard nothing, so the gun was not swung ashore and then spirited away.  \n   • Yet the ship is sitting just as deep in the water as yesterday; if the cannon (several tons) had truly been taken ashore, the Resolve would now ride higher.  \n   • A huge “stack of pig iron bricks” – conveniently Parker’s private cargo for Turkle – lies along the keel, covered by an oil-cloth. That stack is the perfect hiding place: lay the cannon on the keel, pile the bricks around and over it, throw on the cloth, and the weight distribution and draft remain unchanged.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   • Because the ship’s draft has not changed, the cannon’s weight is still aboard.  \n   • The only feasible hiding place observed is beneath the “pig iron.”  \n   • Therefore the cannon never left the Resolve; ergo the “thief” is the man in charge of the Resolve – Captain Parker.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCaptain Parker, Bob Turkle, Tom Wise, Paul Rhodes\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCaptain Parker\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone (other than unnamed members of Parker’s crew)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Yesterday: Captain Parker docks the Resolve with the French long-range cannon lashed on deck.  \n• Night-time high tide: wanting to steal the costly weapon, Parker orders a few trusted sailors to rig the ship’s own tackle. They quietly lower the cannon through the main hatch to the hold, lay it lengthwise along the keel, then stack Bob Turkle’s pig-iron bricks around and over it. They throw an oil-soaked tarpaulin over the whole mass. From the dock, nothing appears disturbed; no dockside derricks or lights are used, so the guards see and hear nothing.  \n• Dawn: Bob Turkle arrives to enquire about his iron. The gun is already hidden; the iron is visible, so nothing seems amiss.  \n• Morning: The guards notice the cannon missing from the deck and raise an alarm. Because the vessel’s draft has not changed (still awash to the same Roman-numeral mark), John Webster realises the weight must be aboard.  \n• Shortly before Parker can cast off, Webster announces that the cannon is hidden under the pig-iron and has the captain arrested.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Bob Turkle – although on the dock before dawn – had no access to the ship’s hold and wanted only his pig iron. Stealing the cannon would deprive the patriots whose cause he supports.  \n• Tom Wise and Paul Rhodes – the Loyalists – talked big but lacked opportunity: no ship, no heavy lifting gear, and nowhere to conceal a three-ton cannon in a fish stall or bakery.  \n• Only Captain Parker had continuous control of the vessel, the motive (profit), the ability (ship’s tackle and crew), and, as shown by the unchanged waterline and the concealed shape under the pig-iron, physical possession of the cannon.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "John Webster explained to everyone that Bob Turkle, the blacksmith, had no motive, as he’s a patriot. Why would he want to steal the gun and hurt his cause?”\n“Tom Wise, the fishmonger,” Webster continued, “is simply not big and strong enough to handle such a large ordnance. And Paul Rhodes, the baker, has a limp. He also couldn’t have shifted it.”\nHe pointed to the captain. “Arrest him. He moved the cannon.”\nThe captain appeared grim and the constable looked confused. “He couldn't move that heavy thing alone,” the constable insisted. “It would take at least five men with block and tackle.”\nJohn smiled. “Peter gave me the idea. This is how the captain did it: The ancient Greeks used ocean tides to lower and lift enormous weights from their ships,” John explained. “Captain Parker used the same principle to move the cannon.”\nThe constable laughed. “Then where did he carry it John, and how come nobody saw him?”\nJohn pointed past the docks. “It's still on the ship, constable.”\nJohn explained how he had checked the draft numerals yesterday when the ship first docked and when Peter had asked him about the numerals he noticed that they were the same today. The cannon had to still be on the ship.\nCaptain Parker had stalled at sea until he knew that a very high tide was going to occur. That was the night of the theft. By attaching a single pulley – well oiled to prevent noise – to the overhanging lifting arm, running a chain through it with one end attached to the cannon and the other to a cleat beneath the stack of iron, he had a hydraulic lifting device.\nBy waiting until the ship was almost at its lowest point and then attaching the chain, the cannon was only raised enough to swing it over the hatch. Since the distance from the cannon’s resting place on deck to the top of the iron pile was only a few feet, it was lowered easily when the tide started raising the ship.\nWhile the captain was waiting for this to occur, he removed the oilcloth and also enough iron brick to create a hole for the cannon to be secreted in. When the transfer was complete he simply piled the brick back over the cannon and replaced the oilcloth. A cursory inspection around the perimeter of the iron pile would reveal nothing.\n“Well done, Peter,\" his father said. \"Ten more minutes and the captain would have removed the blacksmith’s iron from the outside of the pile, changing the weight and hiding the difference from us.”\nJohn Webster stared at the captain a moment before speaking. “Captain Parker, I don't know why you did it, but I suspect it was to sell to the British for a profit.”\nPeter felt great. Even though he knew that his father had solved the mystery, he had helped a little.",

Since the distance from the cannon’s resting place on deck to the top of the iron pile was only a few feet, it was lowered easily when the tide started raising the ship.\nWhile the captain was waiting for this to occur, he removed the oilcloth and also enough iron brick to create a hole for the cannon to be secreted in. When the transfer was complete he simply piled the brick back over the cannon and replaced the oilcloth. A cursory inspection around the perimeter of the iron pile would reveal nothing.\n“Well done, Peter,\" his father said. \"Ten more minutes and the captain would have removed the blacksmith’s iron from the outside of the pile, changing the weight and hiding the difference from us.”\nJohn Webster stared at the captain a moment before speaking. “Captain Parker, I don't know why you did it, but I suspect it was to sell to the British for a profit.”\nPeter felt great. Even though he knew that his father had solved the mystery, he had helped a little."
