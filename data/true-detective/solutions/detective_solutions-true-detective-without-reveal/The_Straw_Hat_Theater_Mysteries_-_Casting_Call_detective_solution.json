    "full_text": "“Say what you will about the Straw Hat circuit,” Arthur Glendon observed, “it does get us out of New York for the hot summer.” He waved a hand around, taking in the Straw Hat Theater, with its inviting lodge and Summer Theater, a hillside picture book Vermont setting. Janice Starling smiled. “Oh, I don’t know, Summer Theater is rather fun, and all that, I’ll agree, but we’re all hoping for something new, something to take us back to Broadway.” “As if you had ever been there, except for buying a ticket as a member of the audience for one of my plays,” Alice Cartwright said. “But Janice does have a point. New York is where the best opportunities are in the theater. Frankly, when I’m not in the city” - she said the word as though only one city existed in the world - “I just can’t wait to get back. Anyway, Arthur, what play are you casting for? I assume from your message on my cell phone, and the presence of these ladies that you have something specific in mind.” “No need to get over dramatic, dear,” interjected Sandra Buckingham, seated on the most comfortable chair in the room, which she had chosen as her entitlement. “It won’t help you get the part, whatever Arthur has in mind.” “Thank heavens I only asked the three of you!” Arthur thought. What he actually said was quite different. “We’re doing a new play, a comedy, “All’s Right, Now That You’re Here”. There is a wonderful female romantic lead, Rosemary. She’s full of fun and deviltry.” He paused for effect. “Surely one of you at least will fit the part perfectly. I have the scripts for you here. Take them back to the lodge. I’ll hear tryouts tomorrow morning at ten. Then we’ll really get down to business, with excerpts from the play. You - I mean for rehearsal, and then the lead actually selected - will be reading opposite Rex Lansford. I’ll be picking him up later tonight at the airport.” That was Arthur Glendon’s moment, and he had played it to the hilt. The three women gasped. Nobody had expected to find, in this rural corner of Vermont, that Rex Lansford would be playing in Summer Theater. Lansford, they all knew, had just last week celebrated the opening of his latest film, a summer blockbuster that was earning more than Steven Spielberg’s latest. Each woman knew that playing opposite Hollywood’s most bankable leading man could launch a career, or jump-start a stalled one. Janice Starling, Sandra Buckingham and Alice Cartwright each swore that she would get that part - nothing would stand in the way of that happening. They took their scripts and melted away to the lodge. The actresses came to the realization at just about the same time. The play’s story was about an actress who got her big break by making sure that the competition for the part was unable to try out. It all seemed rather amateurish, a laxative substituted for a chocolate bar, a misleading phone message that the tryout was rescheduled, that sort of thing. It was an updated, “All About Eve” with an edge. But it was also a broad comedy, played strictly for laughs, and the part absolutely sparkled. Played opposite Rex Lansford, who knew where it might lead? And just what did Arthur Glendon have in mind, anyway? Didn’t he know how nervous he was making them? Was life supposed to imitate art, or the other way around? Three guards went up, and the three actresses each made plans to secure the part. The more they read the play, the more the part sparkled, and the more they suspected each other. They each came to dinner and sat at separate tables, glowering across the dining room. Nobody was going to slip a laxative past them! The evening was devoted to rehearsal preparation, each in her own room. It went on and on. In the wee hours of the morning, Sandra Buckingham talked so loudly that Alice Cartwright, who had the room just beneath Sandra’s, pounded on the ceiling with a stick to quiet her rival. The noise stopped. “Well, she’s really there after all,” Alice thought. “We’ll see about her in the morning!” Janice Starling, who had the room next to Alice Cartwright, yawned in exhaustion. She decided not to go to breakfast in the morning. She asked the front desk for a wake up call, then took a sleeping pill and went back to bed. Promptly at ten o’clock the following morning, Alice and Sandra were on the set, ready for the casting call. Arthur was first on the set as usual. He frowned, but refused the suggestion that someone be sent to remind the missing Janice Starling that she was overdue for the tryout. “Pass me some of that hot lemonade, will you dearie?” Sandra said to Alice. Alice poured a mug of hot lemonade from the rolling snack bar just off the set. It was Sandra’s habit during rehearsals - so ingrained that directors made fun of the “hot lemonade” clause in her contracts. She wanted to clear her throat before going on stage. Sandra got just half way through her prepared monologue when she gasped and grabbed her throat. “What’s going on!” she managed to say, in between coughs ... “Somebody sabotaged this drink. It’s got vinegar in it!” She glared at Alice and tried wildly to find something to clear her vocal cords. Finally, she sat down and stared at Glendon. “Give me some time to get over this,” she said. “Of course, dear,” Glendon replied, in his very best butter-wouldn’t-melt tone of voice. He made a call with his cell phone, and then motioned to Alice Cartwright to begin her presentation. She started her monologue, but at that moment, Rex Lansford came onto the set. Glendon waved at Alice to continue, but with Lansford as a surprised witness, he and Sandra spent the next twenty minutes telling each other loud, boisterous stories. From onstage, Alice Cartwright looked at them first pleadingly, then in an imperious way, every inch Mary Queen of Scots faced with her persecutors. Then Janice Starling entered the set, out of breath, dress barely arranged, embarrassed, and full of apologies. “I left a wakeup call, but they never called me until just a few minutes ago,” she said. The excuse sounded lame, and her voice began to lose confidence. Arthur Glendon made a great show of looking at his watch. Janice glared at him and broke into her monologue. It was brilliantly performed. She smiled and left the stage. “Not so fast,” Alice said. “If you two are now ready to listen, I’m ready to perform.” Her monologue was flawless. Sandra had cleared her throat at last. She had spent the evening memorizing Rosemary’s key speech at the end of Act Two. It was so well done, that even her competitors applauded. Then Rex Lansford spoke to the three women. “You are all fine actresses, and Rosemary is a special part, somewhat devilish, I think Arthur told you. Just think what she would have done to get her part.” Then a light seemed to dawn, and the veteran star added, “I know what happened, and who is responsible for this very odd and untraditional tryout.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  Someone wanted the three actresses to experience in real life exactly what the heroine of the new comedy, Rosemary, does in the play – underhandedly knocking out the competition.  \n   •  None of the three women would purposely handicap herself, but all three were indeed handicapped.  \n   •  Therefore the only logical motive is not rivalry, but an audition gimmick: the saboteur wanted to watch how each actress handled the “crisis” in order to decide who really could play Rosemary.\n\n2.  Opportunity & means  \n   a)  Janice’s missing wake-up call  \n       – Could only be arranged through the desk.  \n       – The one person who could give a quiet, unquestioned instruction to the hotel clerk is the producer/director, Arthur Glendon.  \n   b)  Vinegar in the “hot lemonade”  \n       – Sandra always asks for it; everybody teases her about the “hot-lemonade clause”.  \n       – Whoever stocked the rehearsal rolling snack bar put the vinegar in the pitcher beforehand; the drink was already tainted before Alice poured it.  \n       – Again, the one person who routinely gives instructions to the prop crew and to catering is Arthur.  \n   c)  The interruption of Alice’s monologue  \n       – Just as Alice begins, Arthur makes a quick mobile-phone call; seconds later Rex Lansford strolls in and Arthur & Sandra begin a loud conversation that ruins Alice’s reading.  \n       – The timing shows Arthur deliberately arranged the disturbance.\n\n3.  Physical / behavioural clues  \n   •  Arthur refused to let anyone go and fetch Janice – because the delay was part of his plan.  \n   •  His mysterious phone call occurs exactly between one piece of mischief and the next.  \n   •  He is the only person present before everyone else on the set, giving him free access to the lemonade.  \n   •  Rex’s concluding remark – “Just think what she (Rosemary) would have done to get her part … I know what happened, and who is responsible for this very odd and untraditional try-out” – points not to a rival actress but to the man running the try-out.\n\n4.  Logical deduction  \n   •  One saboteur affected all three women, even the one who supposedly benefitted from each trick; that rules out the actresses themselves.  \n   •  Every piece of sabotage required the authority or backstage access that Arthur alone possessed.  \n   •  Therefore Arthur Glendon engineered the wake-up-call failure, the vinegar, and the interruption expressly to watch how each candidate coped – the ultimate “Rosemary test”.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nArthur Glendon, Alice Cartwright, Janice Starling, Sandra Buckingham\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nArthur Glendon\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nKnowing that Rosemary is “full of fun and deviltry,” Arthur Glendon decides to choose his leading lady by putting the three contenders through the same kinds of dirty tricks that appear in the script.\n\n•  During the night he asks the desk clerk to withhold Janice Starling’s wake-up call until ten minutes before the audition, ensuring she will arrive flustered and late.  \n•  Early that morning he supervises the stage crew as they set up the rolling snack bar, telling them to put a generous splash of vinegar into the pot of “hot lemonade” that Sandra always drinks.  \n•  When Sandra naturally requests her pre-rehearsal mug, the vinegar rasps her throat just as planned.  \n•  Immediately after that, Arthur telephones Rex Lansford, waiting outside, and tells him to walk in at once. While Alice is forced to continue her monologue, Arthur pointedly chats with Rex and Sandra, drowning Alice out and ruining her audition.  \n\nBy the time all three women have suffered “accidents” Arthur has seen how each reacts under the exact kind of pressure Rosemary must portray. Rex, recognising the pattern, realises that Arthur—not any of the actresses—is behind the “very odd and untraditional try-out.”\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Alice Cartwright could have poured vinegar into Sandra’s cup, but the whole pitcher was tainted before she touched it. She also had no access to the hotel switchboard to sabotage Janice’s wake-up call, nor could she order Rex to enter on cue.  \n•  Janice Starling certainly would not arrange the missed wake-up call that endangered only herself; she was in bed, under a sleeping pill, at the time the other tricks were set up.  \n•  Sandra Buckingham could not have doctored her own lemonade (she was on stage when the pitcher first appeared) and could not influence the hotel desk or Rex’s entrance.  \n\nOnly Arthur Glendon had the motive, authority, and physical opportunity to stage every bit of mischief. Therefore he—and he alone—is the culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

New York is where the best opportunities are in the theater. Frankly, when I’m not in the city” - she said the word as though only one city existed in the world - “I just can’t wait to get back. Anyway, Arthur, what play are you casting for? I assume from your message on my cell phone, and the presence of these ladies that you have something specific in mind.” “No need to get over dramatic, dear,” interjected Sandra Buckingham, seated on the most comfortable chair in the room, which she had chosen as her entitlement. “It won’t help you get the part, whatever Arthur has in mind.” “Thank heavens I only asked the three of you!” Arthur thought. What he actually said was quite different. “We’re doing a new play, a comedy, “All’s Right, Now That You’re Here”. There is a wonderful female romantic lead, Rosemary.

I’ll be picking him up later tonight at the airport.” That was Arthur Glendon’s moment, and he had played it to the hilt. The three women gasped. Nobody had expected to find, in this rural corner of Vermont, that Rex Lansford would be playing in Summer Theater. Lansford, they all knew, had just last week celebrated the opening of his latest film, a summer blockbuster that was earning more than Steven Spielberg’s latest. Each woman knew that playing opposite Hollywood’s most bankable leading man could launch a career, or jump-start a stalled one. Janice Starling, Sandra Buckingham and Alice Cartwright each swore that she would get that part - nothing would stand in the way of that happening. They took their scripts and melted away to the lodge. The actresses came to the realization at just about the same time. The play’s story was about an actress who got her big break by making sure that the competition for the part was unable to try out. It all seemed rather amateurish, a laxative substituted for a chocolate bar, a misleading phone message that the tryout was rescheduled, that sort of thing. It was an updated, “All About Eve” with an edge. But it was also a broad comedy, played strictly for laughs, and the part absolutely sparkled. Played opposite Rex Lansford, who knew where it might lead? And just what did Arthur Glendon have in mind, anyway? Didn’t he know how nervous he was making them? Was life supposed to imitate art, or the other way around? Three guards went up, and the three actresses each made plans to secure the part. The more they read the play, the more the part sparkled, and the more they suspected each other. They each came to dinner and sat at separate tables, glowering across the dining room. Nobody was going to slip a laxative past them! The evening was devoted to rehearsal preparation, each in her own room. It went on and on. In the wee hours of the morning, Sandra Buckingham talked so loudly that Alice Cartwright, who had the room just beneath Sandra’s, pounded on the ceiling with a stick to quiet her rival. The noise stopped. “Well, she’s really there after all,” Alice thought. “We’ll see about her in the morning!” Janice Starling, who had the room next to Alice Cartwright, yawned in exhaustion. She decided not to go to breakfast in the morning. She asked the front desk for a wake up call, then took a sleeping pill and went back to bed. Promptly at ten o’clock the following morning, Alice and Sandra were on the set, ready for the casting call. Arthur was first on the set as usual. He frowned, but refused the suggestion that someone be sent to remind the missing Janice Starling that she was overdue for the tryout. “Pass me some of that hot lemonade, will you dearie?” Sandra said to Alice. Alice poured a mug of hot lemonade from the rolling snack bar just off the set. It was Sandra’s habit during rehearsals - so ingrained that directors made fun of the “hot lemonade” clause in her contracts. She wanted to clear her throat before going on stage. Sandra got just half way through her prepared monologue when she gasped and grabbed her throat. “What’s going on!” she managed to say, in between coughs ... “Somebody sabotaged this drink. It’s got vinegar in it!” She glared at Alice and tried wildly to find something to clear her vocal cords. Finally, she sat down and stared at Glendon. “Give me some time to get over this,” she said. “Of course, dear,” Glendon replied, in his very best butter-wouldn’t-melt tone of voice. He made a call with his cell phone, and then motioned to Alice Cartwright to begin her presentation. She started her monologue, but at that moment, Rex Lansford came onto the set. Glendon waved at Alice to continue, but with Lansford as a surprised witness, he and Sandra spent the next twenty minutes telling each other loud, boisterous stories. From onstage, Alice Cartwright looked at them first pleadingly, then in an imperious way, every inch Mary Queen of Scots faced with her persecutors. Then Janice Starling entered the set, out of breath, dress barely arranged, embarrassed, and full of apologies. “I left a wakeup call, but they never called me until just a few minutes ago,” she said. The excuse sounded lame, and her voice began to lose confidence. Arthur Glendon made a great show of looking at his watch. Janice glared at him and broke into her monologue. It was brilliantly performed. She smiled and left the stage. “Not so fast,” Alice said. “If you two are now ready to listen, I’m ready to perform.” Her monologue was flawless. Sandra had cleared her throat at last. She had spent the evening memorizing Rosemary’s key speech at the end of Act Two. It was so well done, that even her competitors applauded. Then Rex Lansford spoke to the three women. “You are all fine actresses, and Rosemary is a special part, somewhat devilish, I think Arthur told you. Just think what she would have done to get her part.” Then a light seemed to dawn, and the veteran star added, “I know what happened, and who is responsible for this very odd and untraditional tryout.”",

    "reveal_text": "Arthur Glendon sabotaged the tryouts, or tried to, to see if any of the actresses would react with a finer performance, as the leading character in the play, Rosemary, would have reacted. After their nervous rehearsals the night before, Alice and Sandra were his unwitting accomplices. Alice handed Sandra the vinegar-laced lemonade, but only Glendon could have known Sandra’s habit and also, as first on the set, could have had the opportunity of putting vinegar into the flask that contained her drink.\nAfter that, it was natural for the furious Sandra, who blamed Alice, to join with him in deliberate loud conversation to sabotage Alice’s tryout. When confronted, Glendon also admitted arranging with the front desk not to call Janice. When he called her on the cell phone disguising his voice, the others were already at the tryout. His plan worked after a fashion, spurring the three actresses to greater performances. But it may have also have set the stage for revenge as the play progressed later that summer.\nFor the time being, however, the diplomatic Rex Lansford saved the day. “Rosemary is a great part, but so also are the two female supporting roles. I’m sure we’ll all work well together,” he said with a smile, “both here at the Straw Hat Theater, and during the movie I’m sure will be made of this fine play. Now let’s get on with the tryouts!”",

The more they read the play, the more the part sparkled, and the more they suspected each other. They each came to dinner and sat at separate tables, glowering across the dining room. Nobody was going to slip a laxative past them! The evening was devoted to rehearsal preparation, each in her own room. It went on and on. In the wee hours of the morning, Sandra Buckingham talked so loudly that Alice Cartwright, who had the room just beneath Sandra’s, pounded on the ceiling with a stick to quiet her rival. The noise stopped. “Well, she’s really there after all,” Alice thought. “We’ll see about her in the morning!” Janice Starling, who had the room next to Alice Cartwright, yawned in exhaustion. She decided not to go to breakfast in the morning. She asked the front desk for a wake up call, then took a sleeping pill and went back to bed. Promptly at ten o’clock the following morning, Alice and Sandra were on the set, ready for the casting call. Arthur was first on the set as usual. He frowned, but refused the suggestion that someone be sent to remind the missing Janice Starling that she was overdue for the tryout. “Pass me some of that hot lemonade, will you dearie?” Sandra said to Alice. Alice poured a mug of hot lemonade from the rolling snack bar just off the set. It was Sandra’s habit during rehearsals - so ingrained that directors made fun of the “hot lemonade” clause in her contracts. She wanted to clear her throat before going on stage. Sandra got just half way through her prepared monologue when she gasped and grabbed her throat. “What’s going on!” she managed to say, in between coughs ... “Somebody sabotaged this drink. It’s got vinegar in it!” She glared at Alice and tried wildly to find something to clear her vocal cords. Finally, she sat down and stared at Glendon. “Give me some time to get over this,” she said. “Of course, dear,” Glendon replied, in his very best butter-wouldn’t-melt tone of voice. He made a call with his cell phone, and then motioned to Alice Cartwright to begin her presentation. She started her monologue, but at that moment, Rex Lansford came onto the set. Glendon waved at Alice to continue, but with Lansford as a surprised witness, he and Sandra spent the next twenty minutes telling each other loud, boisterous stories. From onstage, Alice Cartwright looked at them first pleadingly, then in an imperious way, every inch Mary Queen of Scots faced with her persecutors. Then Janice Starling entered the set, out of breath, dress barely arranged, embarrassed, and full of apologies. “I left a wakeup call, but they never called me until just a few minutes ago,” she said. The excuse sounded lame, and her voice began to lose confidence. Arthur Glendon made a great show of looking at his watch. Janice glared at him and broke into her monologue. It was brilliantly performed. She smiled and left the stage. “Not so fast,” Alice said. “If you two are now ready to listen, I’m ready to perform.” Her monologue was flawless. Sandra had cleared her throat at last. She had spent the evening memorizing Rosemary’s key speech at the end of Act Two. It was so well done, that even her competitors applauded. Then Rex Lansford spoke to the three women. “You are all fine actresses, and Rosemary is a special part, somewhat devilish, I think Arthur told you. Just think what she would have done to get her part.” Then a light seemed to dawn, and the veteran star added, “I know what happened, and who is responsible for this very odd and untraditional tryout.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Alice Cartwright; (b) Arthur Glendon; (c) Janice Starling; (d) Sandra Buckingham",
      "answer": "(b) Arthur Glendon",
      "outcome": "Arthur Glendon sabotaged the tryouts, or tried to, to see if any of the actresses would react with a finer performance, as the leading character in the play, Rosemary, would have reacted. After their nervous rehearsals the night before, Alice and Sandra were his unwitting accomplices. Alice handed Sandra the vinegar-laced lemonade, but only Glendon could have known Sandra’s habit and also, as first on the set, could have had the opportunity of putting vinegar into the flask that contained her drink.\nAfter that, it was natural for the furious Sandra, who blamed Alice, to join with him in deliberate loud conversation to sabotage Alice’s tryout. When confronted, Glendon also admitted arranging with the front desk not to call Janice. When he called her on the cell phone disguising his voice, the others were already at the tryout. His plan worked after a fashion, spurring the three actresses to greater performances. But it may have also have set the stage for revenge as the play progressed later that summer.\nFor the time being, however, the diplomatic Rex Lansford saved the day. “Rosemary is a great part, but so also are the two female supporting roles. I’m sure we’ll all work well together,” he said with a smile, “both here at the Straw Hat Theater, and during the movie I’m sure will be made of this fine play. Now let’s get on with the tryouts!”"
