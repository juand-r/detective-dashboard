    "full_text": "Four elderly ladies sat at the dining room table in Ruth Hoskins’s home. Ruth was ninety years old but still lived alone with the assistance of her son, who came over twice a week. Ruth was clear-minded but failing physically. She could only move around slowly and with the aid of a cane. With difficulty, she entered from the kitchen to join the others at her beautiful cherry wood table. Ruth always made it a point to make certain her guests were seated before joining them from the kitchen. It was common practice at their gatherings that the tea service would stay in the kitchen, self-served. Ruth, very much a person of old school social graces, was ashamed and embarrassed that she was so weak in her hands that she could not pour the tea in the dining room from a pitcher. The women sat in silence, all of them keenly aware that, at this time last week, there had been six of them. But not now, for Vera Waller had died suddenly shortly after their last meeting. Seventy-five-year old Mary considered it a blessing that they had almost a week to recover from the shock. But Ruth had another shock for the gathered ladies. After settling in her chair, she looked straight at Leona and said bluntly, “One of us murdered Vera. I don’t appreciate that it was done in my home, right under our noses. One of us laced her tea with enough arsenic to drop a horse.” It was no accident that Ruth directed her comments toward Leona, for Leona, eighty years old and almost deaf, was the most obnoxious person in their unofficial club. Ruth had very little patience with her, and didn’t want to have to repeat herself. The ladies looked stunned. Ruth glanced at Frances. She detested how Frances dressed when visiting her home. Frances always wore a brightly colored, tight-fitting sweatsuit, though unlike last week, this week she brought a matching purse with her. While Frances was still trim and svelte at sixty-nine, Ruth thought her many years too old for this but said nothing, for all of them liked Frances for her kindness and thoughtfulness. Frances asked, “How do you know she was murdered? Has anyone spoken to the police? Ruth said, “There was a pool of pungent liquid left on my kitchen counter. The killer must have been in a hurry and spilled it. It’s a good thing I suspected something and had it tested or I may be dead, too. As for the police, yes, they are waiting to arrest the murderer when our meeting is over.” The high-strung Mary spoke. In a shaky voice, she said, “I didn’t have tea last week and never entered the kitchen.” Mary was on the verge of tears. Ruth merely nodded her head; she remembered Mary hadn’t been in the kitchen at all the week before. She hated it that the quiet, soft-spoken Mary had to endure this. Ruth thought briefly that she was surprised that Alice had so far said nothing. Normally, Alice wouldn’t shut up. Before Ruth could continue that sour line of thought, Leona said, shrilly, “I don’t know why you looked at me like you did. I didn’t kill her!” Ruth remained quiet for a long moment before answering. Leona was a difficult woman to like. Among other things was her slovenly demeanor. She was not a well-coordinated person and her advanced age had not helped. She always seemed on the verge of stumbling. Her jerky hand and arm movements combined with her loose clothes, oversize handbag, and sun hat made her look like a down-and-out bag lady. Worse was that she often acted as if she was. Still, Ruth and the others put up with her, even if she sometimes got on their nerves. Ruth sighed. “Nobody said you did, so just relax.” Facing Ruth, Alice finally spoke up. “I poured your tea along with mine.” She added, wryly, “And we’re both still alive.” Alice was sixty-eight years old and very spry for her age. Ruth considered that she observed all of Alice’s movements when in the kitchen with her the previous week—she liked her tea a certain way, and wanted to make sure Alice got it right. Indeed, watching others was something she was good at. It was her compensation for being old and mostly immobile. What the ladies did not know was that Ruth’s nephew, Lt. Danny Hoskins of the local police department, waited silently in her bedroom with a uniformed officer, listening carefully for signs of trouble and waiting to arrest the murderer when his Aunt Ruth pointed her out. Hoskins knew that, although Aunt Ruth’s body may be failing, there was nothing wrong with her keen mind. He knew this would be over in a few minutes. As if on cue, Ruth pointed a shaky finger at the murderer and said, loud as she could, “Come out, Danny.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First narrow the field  \n• Ruth is the host and far too weak to have carried a bottle big enough to leave a “pool” on the counter.  \n• Vera is the victim.  \nThe remaining five women therefore supply the murderer.\n\n2. Who had NO opportunity?  \nMary never entered the kitchen and did not even drink tea.  Ruth confirms that memory, so Mary is eliminated.\n\n3. Who was under continuous observation?  \nWhile Alice was in the kitchen she was shoulder-to-shoulder with Ruth, who was literally instructing her how to prepare the tea Ruth likes.  Ruth prides herself on “watching others.”  Alice therefore could not have removed a bottle, uncorked it, poured the poison, cleaned up and hidden the bottle while Ruth stood two feet away.  Alice is eliminated.\n\n4. What is the one piece of physical evidence?  \nA sizable “pool of pungent liquid” remained on the kitchen counter.  Whoever handled the poison was clumsy enough—or physically shaky enough—to spill a noticeable amount and flee without wiping it up.\n\n5. Which of the remaining women fits that description?  \n• Leona is described again and again as jerky, unco-ordinated, “always on the verge of stumbling,” and she drags an oversized handbag around with her.  \n• Frances, by contrast, is trim, svelte and athletic in her tight sweatsuit; clumsiness is not a trait attributed to her.\n\n6. Means and concealment  \nAn oversized handbag is the easiest way to smuggle in a bottle of arsenic solution.  Frances had no bag at all last week—only a skintight sweatsuit—so she had no convenient place for a large container, whereas Leona did.\n\n7. Behaviour at the table  \nWhen Ruth first announces the murder she turns her face toward Leona so the nearly-deaf woman can read her lips.  Leona immediately bursts out with a shrill denial that no one has asked for—classic guilty reaction (“I don’t know why you looked at me like you did.  I didn’t kill her!”).  Ruth replies, “Nobody said you did,” purely to quiet her, not to clear her.\n\n8. The deduction  \nOnly one woman (a) had ready storage space; (b) was clumsy enough to leave a pool on the counter; (c) had the opportunity to lace Vera’s individual cup after Ruth left the kitchen; and (d) showed the panicky, unsolicited denial of guilt.  That woman is Leona.\n\nTherefore Ruth’s trembling finger, just before she called in her nephew, was pointed at:\n\n  Leona Mallory.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMary Wilson, Alice Carter, Frances Young, Leona Mallory\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nLeona Mallory\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAt last week’s gathering everyone drifted to the kitchen to pour tea for herself.  \n• Leona, carrying her ever-present capacious handbag, waited until the others had poured and left.  \n• She opened the handbag, produced a bottle of arsenic solution, and hurriedly poured a dose into Vera Waller’s cup.  \n• Because of her habitual jerkiness she sloshed some of the poison onto the counter, leaving a “pool of pungent liquid.”  \n• Flustered, she stuffed the bottle back into her bag and re-entered the dining-room.  \n• Vera drank her doctored tea, went home and died a few hours later.  \n\nDuring the week Ruth had the spilled liquid analysed, learned it was arsenic, and arranged with her nephew, Lt. Danny Hoskins, to hide in the bedroom while she confronted the ladies.  As soon as Leona’s guilty outburst confirmed Ruth’s own observations, she pointed at Leona and summoned Danny to make the arrest.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMary Wilson – Never went into the kitchen and never touched a teacup, so she had no opportunity at all.  \n\nAlice Carter – Was under Ruth’s direct scrutiny while preparing Ruth’s and her own tea; no chance to tamper with another cup or to handle a hidden bottle.  \n\nFrances Young – Had no handbag or other place to carry a sizeable container at the previous meeting, and nothing in her description suggests the unco-ordinated clumsiness that produced the large spill found by Ruth.  She also showed no unusual anxiety when Ruth announced the police involvement, unlike Leona’s immediate shrill denial.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Ruth did not enjoy this. It was true that she was ninety years old, tired, grumpy, and soon to join many family and friends in the hereafter. Even so, her bark was much worse than her bite and she had a genuine affection for all of the ladies at her table. It broke her heart that one of them murdered another dear friend, even though it was undoubtedly a mercy killing, as seventy-six-year-old Vera had suffered agonizing cancer and chemotherapy aftereffects for over a year.\nThe blood had drained from the killer’s face. Ruth and the others feared she would faint. As Danny and the officer with him stood in back of her chair watching closely, she asked in a low voice, so low it could barely be heard, “How did you know?”\nRuth, the emotion of the last week weighing heavily upon her ninety-year-old body, summoned her energy and began speaking.\n“It had to be you. Let me spell it out. First, it could not have been me. Everyone knows I am too weak now to pour for the rest of you and it would have made no sense to have had the poison on my counter top tested had I been the killer. Why would I draw unnecessary attention to myself?”\nRuth continued. “It wasn’t Alice. I watched her pour my tea and hers. I know she’s pretty spry for an old gal so I watched everything she did. Not much escapes my attention, especially in my own kitchen.”\nRuth paused, took a sip of tea, and resumed her discourse. “It wasn’t Mary. Mind you, I’m not ruling her out because she is nice and obviously shaken up over this. We all are, but she didn’t have tea last week and never entered the kitchen.”\nGlancing now to Frances, she offered, “I’ve never liked those outfits you wear. I know I’m being rude but you are being cleared of murder. There is no way you could have hidden even a small bottle of poison in that tight suit, plus you left you purse outside.”\nTurning now to Leona, she said, evenly, “It was you. I admit I would have missed it if I had not been able to eliminate the others. It was easy for you to bring poison in unnoticed in your handbag or dress, plus your nervous movements and loudness caused me to miss your spill.”\nLooking at her nephew Danny, her favorite of sister Ginny’s three boys, Ruth said, “I suppose these old eyes don’t notice everything, but this time they noticed enough!",
