    "full_text": "Four elderly ladies sat at the dining room table in Ruth Hoskins’s home. Ruth was ninety years old but still lived alone with the assistance of her son, who came over twice a week. Ruth was clear-minded but failing physically. She could only move around slowly and with the aid of a cane. With difficulty, she entered from the kitchen to join the others at her beautiful cherry wood table. Ruth always made it a point to make certain her guests were seated before joining them from the kitchen. It was common practice at their gatherings that the tea service would stay in the kitchen, self-served. Ruth, very much a person of old school social graces, was ashamed and embarrassed that she was so weak in her hands that she could not pour the tea in the dining room from a pitcher. The women sat in silence, all of them keenly aware that, at this time last week, there had been six of them. But not now, for Vera Waller had died suddenly shortly after their last meeting. Seventy-five-year old Mary considered it a blessing that they had almost a week to recover from the shock. But Ruth had another shock for the gathered ladies. After settling in her chair, she looked straight at Leona and said bluntly, “One of us murdered Vera. I don’t appreciate that it was done in my home, right under our noses. One of us laced her tea with enough arsenic to drop a horse.” It was no accident that Ruth directed her comments toward Leona, for Leona, eighty years old and almost deaf, was the most obnoxious person in their unofficial club. Ruth had very little patience with her, and didn’t want to have to repeat herself. The ladies looked stunned. Ruth glanced at Frances. She detested how Frances dressed when visiting her home. Frances always wore a brightly colored, tight-fitting sweatsuit, though unlike last week, this week she brought a matching purse with her. While Frances was still trim and svelte at sixty-nine, Ruth thought her many years too old for this but said nothing, for all of them liked Frances for her kindness and thoughtfulness. Frances asked, “How do you know she was murdered? Has anyone spoken to the police? Ruth said, “There was a pool of pungent liquid left on my kitchen counter. The killer must have been in a hurry and spilled it. It’s a good thing I suspected something and had it tested or I may be dead, too. As for the police, yes, they are waiting to arrest the murderer when our meeting is over.” The high-strung Mary spoke. In a shaky voice, she said, “I didn’t have tea last week and never entered the kitchen.” Mary was on the verge of tears. Ruth merely nodded her head; she remembered Mary hadn’t been in the kitchen at all the week before. She hated it that the quiet, soft-spoken Mary had to endure this. Ruth thought briefly that she was surprised that Alice had so far said nothing. Normally, Alice wouldn’t shut up. Before Ruth could continue that sour line of thought, Leona said, shrilly, “I don’t know why you looked at me like you did. I didn’t kill her!” Ruth remained quiet for a long moment before answering. Leona was a difficult woman to like. Among other things was her slovenly demeanor. She was not a well-coordinated person and her advanced age had not helped. She always seemed on the verge of stumbling. Her jerky hand and arm movements combined with her loose clothes, oversize handbag, and sun hat made her look like a down-and-out bag lady. Worse was that she often acted as if she was. Still, Ruth and the others put up with her, even if she sometimes got on their nerves. Ruth sighed. “Nobody said you did, so just relax.” Facing Ruth, Alice finally spoke up. “I poured your tea along with mine.” She added, wryly, “And we’re both still alive.” Alice was sixty-eight years old and very spry for her age. Ruth considered that she observed all of Alice’s movements when in the kitchen with her the previous week—she liked her tea a certain way, and wanted to make sure Alice got it right. Indeed, watching others was something she was good at. It was her compensation for being old and mostly immobile. What the ladies did not know was that Ruth’s nephew, Lt. Danny Hoskins of the local police department, waited silently in her bedroom with a uniformed officer, listening carefully for signs of trouble and waiting to arrest the murderer when his Aunt Ruth pointed her out. Hoskins knew that, although Aunt Ruth’s body may be failing, there was nothing wrong with her keen mind. He knew this would be over in a few minutes. As if on cue, Ruth pointed a shaky finger at the murderer and said, loud as she could, “Come out, Danny.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could get poison into Vera’s cup?  \n   •  The tea service is kept in the kitchen and each woman must go in, pour her own cup and return to the table.  \n   •  Therefore only those who entered the kitchen had any chance to tamper with Vera’s cup or with the poison itself.\n\n2. Who actually went into the kitchen last week?  \n   •  Mary explicitly says she never entered and she drank no tea.  Ruth confirms this.  (Mary therefore had no opportunity.)  \n   •  Alice went in, but Ruth was in the kitchen with her and “observed all of Alice’s movements.”  If Alice had slipped anything into the tea Ruth would have seen it.  (Alice therefore had opportunity, but a rock-solid witness who watched every move.)  \n   •  The story makes it clear the other two guests, Frances and Leona, made their own trips to the kitchen un-observed.  They alone had an unsupervised opportunity.\n\n3. What physical clues do we have?  \n   •  Ruth found “a pool of pungent liquid” on the kitchen counter.  The killer was in a hurry and spilled some of the poisoned tea while dosing Vera’s cup.  \n   •  Of the two women with opportunity, only one is consistently described as un-co-ordinated and prone to spilling things: Leona – “jerky hand and arm movements … always on the verge of stumbling … slovenly demeanour.”  \n   •  Frances, by contrast, is described as trim, neat and careful; nothing suggests she would splash poison and leave an obvious puddle.\n\n4. Process of elimination.  \n   •  Mary – no opportunity.  \n   •  Alice – watched the whole time she was in the kitchen.  \n   •  Frances – opportunity, but the physical evidence (the sloppy spill) does not fit her.  \n   •  Leona – opportunity and the spill fits her known clumsiness.  No other evidence contradicts her guilt.\n\n5. Why Ruth stared at Leona first.  \n   •  Ruth wanted Leona, who is “almost deaf,” to understand every word and did not want to repeat herself – another hint that Leona is her prime suspect.\n\nCombining opportunity, the spill, Leona’s known clumsiness and the absence of any exculpating witness, Ruth could only have been pointing at Leona when she summoned Lt. Danny to come out and make the arrest.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRuth Hoskins, Mary (only given as “Mary”), Frances (only given as “Frances”), Leona (only given as “Leona”), Alice (only given as “Alice”)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLeona\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAt last week’s gathering the ladies got up one at a time to the kitchen to pour their own tea.  \nLeona entered after Vera.  Carrying a bottle of arsenic solution in her oversized handbag, she poured a cup for Vera, secretly tipped a large dose of arsenic into it, and handed the cup over.  Because of her jerky, unsteady movements she slopped some of the mixture onto the counter but, flustered and in a hurry, left the puddle and hurried back to the dining room.  \nVera drank the poisoned tea and died shortly after going home.  Ruth later discovered the puddle, had it analysed, learned it contained arsenic and realised that the poison must have been added in her kitchen during the tea-pouring.  Remembering who had been unsupervised in the kitchen and whose manner matched the sloppy spill, she concluded that the only possible killer was Leona.  \nToday she assembled the remaining ladies, confronted them, pointed at Leona, and called for her nephew Lt. Danny Hoskins to come out of the bedroom and make the arrest.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Ruth Hoskins – the host; she wanted tea prepared for her and was in the kitchen only while Alice, under her direct observation, poured it.  \n•  Mary – never left the dining room and drank no tea, so she had no chance to introduce poison.  \n•  Alice – was under Ruth’s constant scrutiny while in the kitchen; Ruth would have seen any tampering.  \n•  Frances – had a theoretical opportunity, but her neat, careful nature clashes with the obviously clumsy spill that betrayed the killer; nothing else implicates her.  \nOnly Leona had an unsupervised opportunity and a personality that explains the tell-tale spill; hence she and no one else could have poisoned Vera.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Ruth did not enjoy this. It was true that she was ninety years old, tired, grumpy, and soon to join many family and friends in the hereafter. Even so, her bark was much worse than her bite and she had a genuine affection for all of the ladies at her table. It broke her heart that one of them murdered another dear friend, even though it was undoubtedly a mercy killing, as seventy-six-year-old Vera had suffered agonizing cancer and chemotherapy aftereffects for over a year.\nThe blood had drained from the killer’s face. Ruth and the others feared she would faint. As Danny and the officer with him stood in back of her chair watching closely, she asked in a low voice, so low it could barely be heard, “How did you know?”\nRuth, the emotion of the last week weighing heavily upon her ninety-year-old body, summoned her energy and began speaking.\n“It had to be you. Let me spell it out. First, it could not have been me. Everyone knows I am too weak now to pour for the rest of you and it would have made no sense to have had the poison on my counter top tested had I been the killer. Why would I draw unnecessary attention to myself?”\nRuth continued. “It wasn’t Alice. I watched her pour my tea and hers. I know she’s pretty spry for an old gal so I watched everything she did. Not much escapes my attention, especially in my own kitchen.”\nRuth paused, took a sip of tea, and resumed her discourse. “It wasn’t Mary. Mind you, I’m not ruling her out because she is nice and obviously shaken up over this. We all are, but she didn’t have tea last week and never entered the kitchen.”\nGlancing now to Frances, she offered, “I’ve never liked those outfits you wear. I know I’m being rude but you are being cleared of murder. There is no way you could have hidden even a small bottle of poison in that tight suit, plus you left you purse outside.”\nTurning now to Leona, she said, evenly, “It was you. I admit I would have missed it if I had not been able to eliminate the others. It was easy for you to bring poison in unnoticed in your handbag or dress, plus your nervous movements and loudness caused me to miss your spill.”\nLooking at her nephew Danny, her favorite of sister Ginny’s three boys, Ruth said, “I suppose these old eyes don’t notice everything, but this time they noticed enough!",
