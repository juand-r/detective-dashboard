    "full_text": "My first experience of war was in April 1775. Revolutionaries had just taken control of each of the British North American colonies and set up the Second Continental Congress. Royalists, upon hearing a Continental Army had been formed, were not happy. They made preparations to send regiments to Concord to capture inventory supplies and squash the rebel movement. Dr. Joseph Warren received word of the impending invasion and alerted colonists. As quickly as possible all able-bodied men between the ages of 16 and 60 were being mobilized to fight, some of these men were Minutemen, who promised to be ready within two minutes when called. I was to become one of these Minutemen and fight in many of the Revolutionary battles, but this is not where my story begins. My story begins with the very first battle that marks the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Lexington and ConcordLittle did we know at the time that our little hut, along with many others between Charlestown and Lexington, would become the first militia fortresses. April 18, 1775 The sun had just risen, word of a coming battle had spread like wild fire through these parts days before. There were four of us in the hut: Stevie Brown, a new lodger; Lyle Day, a friend from a nearby town who had been forced to stay the with us after the loss of light made the continuation of his long journey too dangerous; Mary Wright, the Walton's maid who had been abandoned and left for dead in a neighboring house; and, of course, myself. My mother and sister were on their yearly pilgrimage to get supplies for the laundry and were not due back for at least another week. I was pleased that fate had somehow managed to remove them from this tense situation. As always I was the second to rise. Stevie always got up at 3 a.m. to help with the milking on a nearby farm. This morning was a little different: I was keeping watch after Revere had ridden past with a warning that the red coats were on their way. I must have accidentally dozed off for a little while as I sat watching out the kitchen window. I went about the morning task of getting wood for the fire to prepare the morning meal. I had prepared and loaded my musket the night before and, as I did every night, left it by the door. There was something eerie about this morning – something I couldn't quite put my finger on – but, all the same, I continued my morning’s work. That is when I noticed it. The musket was gone. Thinking that maybe I had misplaced it, I started to search the cabin; but after an hour it was still nowhere to be found. As I sat at the kitchen table pondering the whereabouts of my trusty gun, our new lodger, Stevie Brown, walked into the kitchen and plunked himself down in a chair. “Mornin’ John.” “How was milkin’ this mornin’?” “All right until the rain came in and the cows were covered in mud.” Stevie was at the washbasin washing the mud from his face and hands. \"Yo’ lookin’ a little jumpy this mornin’, my friend,” he said. Stevie was an old man, but tough as nails and everyone really was his friend. “I can't find my musket,” I replied, still scanning the room. “I left it loaded by the door last night.” “Is that right?” Stevie paused deep in thought for a moment. “Are you sure you left it by the door?” “Positive. I left it by the door last night just like I leave it by the door every night.” “Well, surely it can't have gone far then, lad.” Just as Stevie started scanning the room, there was a loud creak of the floorboard in front of Mary’s room signaling that Mary was approaching. Mary was looking ragged after last night’s dangerous ride from the Walton's. “Mornin’. What seems to be the problem?” Mary asked us immediately, noticing our unsettled nature. “The young lad's musket is missing.” “Oh my!” exclaimed Mary, as she placed her hand over her mouth. “Are you sure you haven't misplaced it?” “Positive.” I replied. “Well, we can't search on an empty stomach, lad. Let’s eat some of that porridge you've been cooking up.” On Stevie's word we all sat down at the table and started to eat. Suddenly, my friend Lyle came bouncing down the stairs and joined us. I fetched Lyle a bowl of porridge. “Lyle, I don't suppose you have seen my musket anywhere?” “Um, nope. Why do you ask?” “It's missing.” “Are you sure?” “Yup.” “I'm sure it’s not missing. Come on, I'll help you look, after breakfast.” Lyle was busy shoving porridge into his mouth. After we finished eating breakfast we all started to look for the musket. We looked everywhere in the hut but there was no sign of it. “Maybe you left it outside, John. Come on, we'll take a look.” I stepped on to the porch with Lyle, where we put our shoes on. “Just a minute, John. I forgot my hat.” Lyle quickly ducked back into the hut and I could hear Mary yelling at him for bringing in mud on his shoes. Stevie followed Lyle out of the hut. “The woman has gone mad in there, cleaning. Think I'll help you lads.” So Lyle, Stevie and I continued our search outside, while Mary continued with her cleaning frenzy inside the hut. The clock struck three in the afternoon and the musket had still not been found. “I'm sorry, lad. I need to push off for a bit. I'll have to help you later.” Stevie was starting to walk over to the stable. “Oh no, you don't,” I said. “How do I know you don't have the musket? If I let you go now you'll go riding off into the sun with my musket and never come back.” I stood in Stevie's path. “Come on, lad. We both know I ain't got your gun.” “No, we don't; so you ain't goin’ anywhere until it's found.” “Come on, John,” Lyle said. “Be reasonable. Stevie don't have your gun, I don't have your gun and Mary don't have your gun. You've put it somewhere and forgot. Stevie's right: it's getting late. I had better head back home before I lose the light again and get stuck here for another night.” “Oh, right, Lyle.” I slapped him on the back. “But you, my friend, aren't going anywhere.” I turned to Stevie. “Well, if I ain't going nowhere then he ain't goin’ nowhere. How do we know he ain't taken your gun?\" “Lyle and I have been friends since I got to this place. I know he would never do a thing like that to his buddy. You, on the other hand, have only just started lodging with us.” “Come on, John: you know I'm a good man. All right, if it makes you feel better, lets all sit down and track our last movements. You first, John.” “OK. Well, at about 9 p.m. last night I rode over to the Walton's to fetch Mary. Mary and I arrived back at the hut at about 10 p.m. I show Mary to her room, then I come back downstairs, clean and load my gun and put it by the door. You two fellas are already in bed, so I blow out all the candles and go to bed myself.” Stevie rubbed his chin in thought, and then he looked at Mary. “Well, after that terrifying ride last night I was exhausted. I went straight to bed after John left me. I didn't hear another word after that.” Still rubbing his chin, Stevie looked at Lyle. “I was in bed before John left and I was the last to get out. I didn't have a chance to take the gun.” “Well that only leaves you, Stevie,” I said, accusingly. “But hang on a minute there, lad. The gun was by the door when I left for milkin’ this mornin’.” I stopped to think. Stevie left for milking at 3 a.m. and I was woken by a rain-soaked Revere at 4 a.m. He had to shout his warning to me over the sound of the rain pelting on the roof. I still had my gun after Revere had passed by. As I sat there working the clues over in my head, something dawns on me: the rain. All of a sudden it became clear who took my musket.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Fix the time-line\n   • 03:00   Stevie leaves for the milking.  It is still dry outside.  \n   • 04:00   Paul Revere arrives in a heavy down-pour.  John is awake, hears the rain on the roof and still has his loaded musket standing by the door.  \n   • 04:10-05:00 (approx.) John nods off in the kitchen.  During this short period the musket disappears.  \n   • Shortly after dawn John discovers the loss; Stevie has not yet returned; Mary is still in her room; Lyle is still upstairs.  \n   Therefore the weapon had to be removed while John was dozing, i.e. after the rain had already started.\n\n2. Who could have taken it?\n   • Stevie was at a distant farm until well after the rain began and did not come back until after John had already searched for the gun.  He simply was not there when the theft occurred.  \n   • Lyle says he “was in bed before John left and was the last to get out.”  To leave the hut he would have had to go down the stairs, pass the sleeping John, open the door, put on the shoes that are kept on the porch, step outside into ankle-deep mud, hide the musket, come back, remove the shoes and go upstairs again – all without being seen or heard.  More importantly, when he finally comes down for breakfast he is completely clean and dry, although anyone who had been outside in that torrential rain would have been filthy.  \n   • Mary’s room opens straight on to the ground floor.  She could slip out without passing John, and her own shoes are kept inside her room, so she did not have to go out on to the porch first.  When she later appears she looks “ragged” but not wet because she has had time to change her clothes.  What really gives her away is her frantic cleaning: she is desperately scrubbing the floor to erase the muddy footprints she made when she came back into the hut.\n\n3. The decisive clue – the rain\n   The thief had to go outside after 04:00, i.e. in a heavy down-pour.  Only one of the four people in the hut shows any sign of trying to get rid of the mud such a trip would inevitably produce: Mary.  Stevie is muddy because he has been working with cows; Lyle does not bother to hide ordinary mud when he pops back for his hat; but Mary is “mad … cleaning” long before anyone else has been outside.  She is plainly removing evidence that she, too, went out into the storm.\n\n4. Motive\n   Mary was the Waltons’ maid and a loyalist.  Removing John’s loaded musket would keep an armed rebel off the field and at the same time supply a weapon for any Royalist that might pass by.  She had the strongest reason to steal it.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nStevie Brown, Lyle Day, Mary Wright\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMary Wright\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter Revere’s warning Mary realised that, once daylight came, John would march off to join the militia with his musket.  \nWhen the rain began and John, exhausted, dozed off at the kitchen window, Mary put on the shoes she kept in her room, slipped out of her door, took the loaded musket from beside the front door and hurried into the darkness.  She hid the weapon under straw behind the stable, then hurried back inside, leaving a trail of wet, muddy prints across the floor.  \nKnowing that the footprints would incriminate her, she spent the early hours of the morning feverishly scrubbing and mopping the floorboards.  When John discovered the loss she pretended surprise and suggested everyone eat first, buying herself a little more time to finish removing the traces of mud.  \nHer over-zealous cleaning, in a house that had not yet become dirty that day, together with the knowledge that whoever took the gun had to go out in the rain, alerted John.  Piecing the times together he realised Stevie was away, Lyle was still upstairs, and only Mary had both the chance and the hidden mud to show for it.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nStevie Brown:  He left the hut at 03:00, before the rain started, and John still had the musket an hour later.  When the weapon vanished Stevie was several miles away in a cow-barn.  He could not physically have committed the theft.\n\nLyle Day:  Lyle was upstairs until breakfast.  To take the musket he would have had to pass John and go outside in the pouring rain, yet when he finally descended he was completely dry and left no mud on the floor.  His only muddy prints appear much later, after everyone has already been outside.\n\nJohn (the narrator):  He reports having the musket after Revere left and immediately raised an alarm when he discovered it gone, behaviour inconsistent with a staged theft.\n\nThus the only person with motive, opportunity and incriminating physical evidence is Mary Wright.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "mystery_text": "My first experience of war was in April 1775. Revolutionaries had just taken control of each of the British North American colonies and set up the Second Continental Congress. Royalists, upon hearing a Continental Army had been formed, were not happy. They made preparations to send regiments to Concord to capture inventory supplies and squash the rebel movement. Dr. Joseph Warren received word of the impending invasion and alerted colonists. As quickly as possible all able-bodied men between the ages of 16 and 60 were being mobilized to fight, some of these men were Minutemen, who promised to be ready within two minutes when called. I was to become one of these Minutemen and fight in many of the Revolutionary battles, but this is not where my story begins. My story begins with the very first battle that marks the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Lexington and ConcordLittle did we know at the time that our little hut, along with many others between Charlestown and Lexington, would become the first militia fortresses. April 18, 1775 The sun had just risen, word of a coming battle had spread like wild fire through these parts days before. There were four of us in the hut: Stevie Brown, a new lodger; Lyle Day, a friend from a nearby town who had been forced to stay the with us after the loss of light made the continuation of his long journey too dangerous; Mary Wright, the Walton's maid who had been abandoned and left for dead in a neighboring house; and, of course, myself. My mother and sister were on their yearly pilgrimage to get supplies for the laundry and were not due back for at least another week. I was pleased that fate had somehow managed to remove them from this tense situation. As always I was the second to rise. Stevie always got up at 3 a.m. to help with the milking on a nearby farm. This morning was a little different: I was keeping watch after Revere had ridden past with a warning that the red coats were on their way. I must have accidentally dozed off for a little while as I sat watching out the kitchen window. I went about the morning task of getting wood for the fire to prepare the morning meal. I had prepared and loaded my musket the night before and, as I did every night, left it by the door. There was something eerie about this morning – something I couldn't quite put my finger on – but, all the same, I continued my morning’s work. That is when I noticed it. The musket was gone. Thinking that maybe I had misplaced it, I started to search the cabin; but after an hour it was still nowhere to be found. As I sat at the kitchen table pondering the whereabouts of my trusty gun, our new lodger, Stevie Brown, walked into the kitchen and plunked himself down in a chair. “Mornin’ John.” “How was milkin’ this mornin’?” “All right until the rain came in and the cows were covered in mud.” Stevie was at the washbasin washing the mud from his face and hands. \"Yo’ lookin’ a little jumpy this mornin’, my friend,” he said. Stevie was an old man, but tough as nails and everyone really was his friend. “I can't find my musket,” I replied, still scanning the room. “I left it loaded by the door last night.” “Is that right?” Stevie paused deep in thought for a moment. “Are you sure you left it by the door?” “Positive. I left it by the door last night just like I leave it by the door every night.” “Well, surely it can't have gone far then, lad.” Just as Stevie started scanning the room, there was a loud creak of the floorboard in front of Mary’s room signaling that Mary was approaching. Mary was looking ragged after last night’s dangerous ride from the Walton's. “Mornin’. What seems to be the problem?” Mary asked us immediately, noticing our unsettled nature. “The young lad's musket is missing.” “Oh my!” exclaimed Mary, as she placed her hand over her mouth. “Are you sure you haven't misplaced it?” “Positive.” I replied. “Well, we can't search on an empty stomach, lad. Let’s eat some of that porridge you've been cooking up.” On Stevie's word we all sat down at the table and started to eat. Suddenly, my friend Lyle came bouncing down the stairs and joined us. I fetched Lyle a bowl of porridge. “Lyle, I don't suppose you have seen my musket anywhere?” “Um, nope. Why do you ask?” “It's missing.” “Are you sure?” “Yup.” “I'm sure it’s not missing. Come on, I'll help you look, after breakfast.” Lyle was busy shoving porridge into his mouth. After we finished eating breakfast we all started to look for the musket. We looked everywhere in the hut but there was no sign of it. “Maybe you left it outside, John. Come on, we'll take a look.” I stepped on to the porch with Lyle, where we put our shoes on. “Just a minute, John. I forgot my hat.” Lyle quickly ducked back into the hut and I could hear Mary yelling at him for bringing in mud on his shoes. Stevie followed Lyle out of the hut. “The woman has gone mad in there, cleaning. Think I'll help you lads.” So Lyle, Stevie and I continued our search outside, while Mary continued with her cleaning frenzy inside the hut. The clock struck three in the afternoon and the musket had still not been found. “I'm sorry, lad. I need to push off for a bit. I'll have to help you later.” Stevie was starting to walk over to the stable. “Oh no, you don't,” I said. “How do I know you don't have the musket? If I let you go now you'll go riding off into the sun with my musket and never come back.” I stood in Stevie's path. “Come on, lad. We both know I ain't got your gun.” “No, we don't; so you ain't goin’ anywhere until it's found.” “Come on, John,” Lyle said. “Be reasonable. Stevie don't have your gun, I don't have your gun and Mary don't have your gun. You've put it somewhere and forgot. Stevie's right: it's getting late. I had better head back home before I lose the light again and get stuck here for another night.” “Oh, right, Lyle.” I slapped him on the back. “But you, my friend, aren't going anywhere.” I turned to Stevie. “Well, if I ain't going nowhere then he ain't goin’ nowhere. How do we know he ain't taken your gun?\" “Lyle and I have been friends since I got to this place. I know he would never do a thing like that to his buddy. You, on the other hand, have only just started lodging with us.” “Come on, John: you know I'm a good man. All right, if it makes you feel better, lets all sit down and track our last movements. You first, John.” “OK. Well, at about 9 p.m. last night I rode over to the Walton's to fetch Mary. Mary and I arrived back at the hut at about 10 p.m. I show Mary to her room, then I come back downstairs, clean and load my gun and put it by the door. You two fellas are already in bed, so I blow out all the candles and go to bed myself.” Stevie rubbed his chin in thought, and then he looked at Mary. “Well, after that terrifying ride last night I was exhausted. I went straight to bed after John left me. I didn't hear another word after that.” Still rubbing his chin, Stevie looked at Lyle. “I was in bed before John left and I was the last to get out. I didn't have a chance to take the gun.” “Well that only leaves you, Stevie,” I said, accusingly. “But hang on a minute there, lad. The gun was by the door when I left for milkin’ this mornin’.” I stopped to think. Stevie left for milking at 3 a.m. and I was woken by a rain-soaked Revere at 4 a.m. He had to shout his warning to me over the sound of the rain pelting on the roof. I still had my gun after Revere had passed by. As I sat there working the clues over in my head, something dawns on me: the rain. All of a sudden it became clear who took my musket.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Lyle Day; (b) Mary Wright; (c) Paul Revere; (d) Stevie Brown",
      "answer": "(a) Lyle Day",
      "outcome": "I fetched Mary last night and did not arrive at the hut until 10 p.m., upon which time she retired. If she had left her room, the creaking floorboard would have woken me. Mary did not have a chance to be alone with the gun.\nStevie got up at 3 a.m. to go to his milking job. He did not arrive back at the hut until after I had noticed my gun was missing, and I still had my gun at least an hour after Stevie had gone to work.\nStevie confirmed that he saw the gun by the door when he left for work at 3 a.m.; thus it is unlikely I misplaced it.\nPaul Revere did not really have time to take the gun, and he didn’t, because I still had it after Revere left the cabin.\nLyle let everyone think that he had been in bed all night when, in fact, because of the mud on his shoes it is obvious he had not been. It did not rain until around 4 a.m., and if Lyle really had been in bed all night he would not have been able to bring mud into the house the next morning. Lyle must have gotten out of bed somewhere between 4 a.m. and when John woke up, and then returned to bed with out anyone noticing."
