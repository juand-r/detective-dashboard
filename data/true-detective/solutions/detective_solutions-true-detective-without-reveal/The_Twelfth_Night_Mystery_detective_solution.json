    "full_text": "It all started when my parents went back to the old country, Poland, for a summer visit. They enjoyed themselves and came back somewhat enlightened, with all sorts of ideas. One of these ideas was to celebrate the story of the Three Wise Men, sometimes called the Three Kings. Now, I’ll have you know, I wasn’t very enthusiastic about all of this. What I really wanted was the kitten I’d asked Santa for. The kitten that Santa, unfortunately, forgot to bring to me on Christmas. My parents, though, didn’t think I was responsible enough for a pet of my own. Or so they said on Christmas day. My father relented just a bit: “Sarah, if you can solve the mystery of the Three Kings, you’ll get your kitten. It all happens on Twelfth Night, the 6th of January. That’s when they arrived at Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. In Poland and some other countries, they remember Twelfth Night, and celebrate it just as much as they do Christmas.” Well, if that meant a second chance to get my Christmas present right, I was all for it! Mother relayed that we would have a special dinner that night, a traditional Polish dinner, with the biggest broiled fish I ever saw. “Eat your dinner, and maybe you’ll grow bigger than your parents did!” she said. Dinner was delicious. There was a cake for dessert, and just before it was served, we had visitors -- three of them, in ancient costumes. “We are the Three Kings, come to bless your house, just as we visited in Bethlehem so long ago. We have come from far, far away.” I looked with astonishment at the apparitions in the doorway. First there was Caspar of Tarsus, a young man with a full beard. “I bring gold,” he said, “for the new king.” He was huge, vigorous and athletic looking, despite the costume. “I am Melchoir of Persia,” said the second man. He was closer to my father’s age, and he looked like one of Dad’s bowling cronies, behind the turban that he wore. “I bring myrrh, the bitter herb.” He had funny looking slippers on, close fitting, with a tassel on the end by the toes. They were still a bit wet from the snow. And the third man seemed older yet. He said that he was Balthasar, an elderly man from Saba in Ethiopia, and his was the gift of a rare perfume, frankincense -- it was so fragrant that it seemed to flood all over his hands. After the introductions, Mother served the special cake. It was festive, and full of almonds, with a rich frosting and ornate decorations. “The person who gets the king token hidden in the cake, wears a special hat and is the king for tonight,” Mother said. “It’s the way that people in the old country remember the visit of the Three Kings to Bethlehem.” Well, the cake was sliced and I nearly broke a tooth on the token. “You get the hat,” Dad said, and everyone clapped toward to me. It was interesting, I’ll admit, but still, I wasn’t very happy. I almost spoiled everything by my sniffling. The nearest of the Three Kings looked at me. “It’s my kitten, Melchoir. I really wanted a little kitten. I even saw her at the Humane Society. Where is she now!” Mother gave a sigh. “King Melchoir,” she said, “Laurie’s been asking for a kitten for weeks. We went to the Humane Society the last day they were open before Christmas. We all saw the kitten. It’s so pretty and playful.” When we got up from the table, Mother mentioned something about caroling, and my playing the piano. Then, just in the nick of time, I was rescued from that embarrassment when I heard a muffled meow coming from another room. Yes, I did! Dad smiled, “Well, Sarah, a promise is a promise. If you can figure out who brought the cat, and where she is, you can keep her!” We looked around the house. We went upstairs and downstairs, and into the recreation room. Then we heard the kitten crying again, very faintly. There was an open window, and it sounded like the kitten was outside. It made a lot of noise for such a little creature. Clearly it wanted to be at home, with me! Dad, Mother and I, Caspar and Balthasar put on boots and overcoats and went outside, while Melchoir kept on the covered porch. “I see some tracks,” I shouted. And I did. There was one set of huge overshoe tracks, and they led from our parking circle up to the outside garage door, just on the other side of the kitchen. “Funny,” said Dad. “There weren’t any tracks when I came home an hour ago! Guess I forgot to lock that outside door!” “How will you know it’s your cat?” Balthasar asked. “It’s a beautiful kitten. White with orange paws and rich thick fur. When we saw her at the Humane Society, Dad said she must be a Maine Coon Cat, at least partly.” Dad suddenly gasped for breath, and took out an inhaler. “It’s my asthma,” he said. “When I spend more than a few seconds in cold weather my asthma acts up, and really puts me out of commission. These inhalers are a lifesaver.” Then, Mother helped him back inside. We opened the garage door and there, in a new animal carrying case, we heard the kitten again. Dad kept the garage fairly warm, but the air was still crisp. Pumpkin, my new kitten, was just as beautiful as I remembered. “And I know who put her here, too,” I said. “So I get to keep my kitten after all. This is the nicest Christmas season I’ve ever had!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. List everyone who could conceivably have put the kitten in the garage shortly before it was found.  \n   • Father  \n   • Mother  \n   • “King Caspar”  \n   • “King Melchoir”  \n   • “King Balthasar”  \n\n2. When could it have been done?  \n   Father tells us he came home an hour earlier and there were no footprints then.  \n   Therefore the kitten was put in the garage during that hour ‑ in other words, after the Three Kings had arrived (or while they were arriving).\n\n3. What physical evidence is there?  \n   • Only ONE set of tracks was visible.  \n   • They were “huge overshoe tracks.”  \n   • The tracks ran from the parking circle to the side-door of the garage.  \n\n4. Who matches those tracks?  \n   • Mother never went outdoors; there would have been two different sets of prints if she had gone out and back.  \n   • Father can remain outdoors only “a few seconds” before his asthma stops him; he would never have had time to walk from the parking circle to the garage, put down the carrier, and walk back.  \n   • Melchoir is specifically described as wearing “close-fitting slippers with a tassel.”  Slipper-prints, even if they were made in snow, would be small and narrow – not “huge overshoe” prints.  \n   • Balthasar’s footwear is never mentioned, but nothing is said about him being unusually large.  \n   • Caspar, on the other hand, is described as “huge, vigorous and athletic looking.”  If anyone in the group would need very large overshoes, it is Caspar.  One set of large overshoe prints = one large man.\n\n5. Why would Caspar do it?  \n   The Three Kings are obviously family friends who have come to act out a bit of Christmas theatre for Sarah.  Caspar’s role in that little drama was to deliver the “gold,” but the real gift – the kitten – had to be sneaked into the garage ahead of time so that Sarah could “discover” it.  Caspar had both motive (he was in on the parents’ plan) and opportunity (he arrived by car, carried the kitten to the garage, and then joined the other two “Kings” at the front door).\n\n6. Logical end-point  \n   ONLY ONE set of tracks => ONLY ONE person went from car to garage.  \n   The only person whose footwear could have made “huge overshoe tracks” is Caspar.  \n   Therefore Caspar is the person who put the kitten in the garage.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFather, Mother, Caspar of Tarsus (“King Caspar”), Melchoir of Persia (“King Melchoir”), Balthasar of Saba (“King Balthasar”)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCaspar of Tarsus (“King Caspar”)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly before dessert, the three costumed visitors drove up and parked in the circular drive.  \nCaspar, the biggest of the three and the one wearing large overshoes, took the kitten—already inside its new carrying case—out of the vehicle.  \nBecause Father had “forgotten” to lock the side door of the garage, Caspar was able to walk straight from the parking circle to that door, leave the carrier inside on the warmish garage floor, close the door again, and proceed with the others to the front entrance of the house.  \nHis single outward-and-back trip left one fresh trail of very large overshoe prints.  \nDuring dinner the kitten began meowing.  At the end of the search Sarah saw the lone set of huge prints, matched them to the only “huge” visitor—Caspar—and solved the puzzle, thus winning her kitten.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Father – His severe cold-induced asthma would not allow him to remain outdoors long enough to carry the kitten from the car to the garage without an attack, and there were no small clusters of interrupted prints or inhaler drops to suggest he made several short trips.\n\n• Mother – She was busy preparing and serving dinner and cake and was never out of the house during the crucial hour.  Any excursion would have produced a second, smaller set of prints.\n\n• Melchoir – His footwear (tight slippers with tassels) could not have produced “huge overshoe” tracks, and the slippers would have been soaked and useless after such a trek, yet he was still wearing them indoors.\n\n• Balthasar – Nothing indicates that he is an unusually large man, and no frankincense scent was noticed in the garage or on the carrier.  Moreover, had he made the trip his footprints would have differed from the oversized ones seen.\n\nOnly Caspar’s size and his likely use of large overshoes match the single trail of tracks; therefore the other suspects are cleared.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
