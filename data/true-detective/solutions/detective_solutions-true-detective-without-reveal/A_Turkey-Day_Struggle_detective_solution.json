    "full_text": "Two dogs walked side by side. One gave a hollow yip and the other barked in response. When the first dog wagged its tail, the second dog bit at it. The second dog was startled by the presence of the first, which was a robotic toy, and had been brought by one of the relatives as the Olem family piled into Aunt Rachel’s house for Thanksgiving. Cousin Chris had brought along the robotic dog for his amusement, but Jack—the actual dog— was not at all pleased by its intrusion. It was much like a dog in the way it acted, and was small, but almost the same size as little Jack. The toy was little better than something sold at Wal-Mart, but still surprisingly detailed. Even its paws looked incredibly realistic. Chris was watching his aunt, Rachel Olem, while she worked furiously in the kitchen preparing a meal for the family. Like every year, they’d all come to temporarily board in her home as she waited on them hand and foot. She seemed as annoyed to have all the visitors as Chris was annoyed to be there; he was not one for holiday trips to see family, and he figured the sooner they got it over with the better. All of this was well known amongst the family, and yet they made no effort to help Rachel, nor did they seek to entertain Chris. Everything seemed to be going routinely (other than the robotic dog), until a shriek came from the basement. Jack, his tail between his legs, was the first react, darting underneath the table while his robotic counterpart found itself walking steadily into a wall. The family—most of whom had been playing football outside—quickly went downstairs, abandoning their usual activities. There they found Aunt Diane, Rachel Olem’s sister-in-law, standing over the table that had once been the bearer of a soon-to-be-cooked turkey. She was furious. “The turkey is gone!” she screamed, spit flying from her mouth. Rachel looked relieved, and some of the family members noticed. But the rest of the family was in an uproar. Accusations began to fly. Before things could get too out of hand, Rachel’s father stepped forward, silencing everyone with a raised hand. He knew that most everyone in the family had just come in from outdoors, and correctly assumed that the turkey culprit would have to have been someone indoors. Diane, Aunt Rachel, the dog Jack and Chris were the main suspects. He quickly dismissed everyone else, and turned to the remaining group. He first turned to Rachel, but not without noticing a set of muddy dog prints leading from the basement steps to the table, and even to the chair that had been right in front of the spot the turkey once sat. Noticing Jack was not present, he spoke to Rachel. “Rachel, isn’t it true that you are always stressed, and even reluctant, to have these family get-togethers?” Rachel did not deny it. “Yes, I’ve already been cooking for hours on end today—I’ve put a lot of work into this meal.” Chris, who had been staring off into space, was the next to wither under his grandfather’s accusing eye. “ Chris, isn’t it true, in your case, that you also do not like these get-togethers, because you find them boring and unappealing?” “Yeah, whatever,” Chris said apathetically. If dogs could talk, the grandfather thought, Jack would be the next one to accuse. He shrugged at the thought and turned on his daughter-in-law, the wife of his eldest son and Chris’s mother. But before he could speak, his daughter Rachel was seething over being accused by her own father. “You can’t honestly believe it was me, can you? I work hard every year to please you ingrates, and this is what I get? If anyone, it was my darling sister-in-law! She’s always hated me since my brother introduced me to her! She just wants to make me look bad!” “Nice going, Mom,” said Chris, who still seemed like he wouldn’t care if the house blew down at the moment. “Now my own son is turning against me?” Diane gasped. “I don’t actually think it’s you, Mom. I just figure you two fighting could mean we’ll get to leave earlier.” Chris’s comment sparked the elderly man’s interest. “Always so selfish, Chris,” Diane said. “Even now you can’t cut me a break, despite the fact that this nonsense woke me up from a nap after driving us here for hours!” Grandfather raised a hand to yet again silence them all. He turned on Diane. “Diane, is it true that you hold ill feelings toward your sister-in-law?” Diane looked reluctant to confirm this notion, but after a moment her shoulders sagged, and her head bobbed up and down. Crash. Small footsteps could be heard padding down the steps, followed by a thunk as something much heavier and harder fell in its wake. When they looked to the staircase, they saw Jack running from the meandering bionic dog, which had taken a tumble down the steps. Jack managed to get off the last landing before Chris’s substitute dog landed on it, and so Jack quickly darted behind Grandfather’s legs. “Well that gives me an idea,” he said as the robotic dog left footprints in its wake. The three family members had begun fighting again, while Jack had recommenced yipping at the bionic intrusion. Grandfather did not subtly call for silence; this time he barked—in a volume much louder than Jack could ever muster—for them to shut up. When they had quieted down, Grandfather spoke. “ I believe I know who has stolen the turkey.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive\n   • Rachel – tired of cooking every year, but the missing turkey only increases her workload, so “getting rid of it” would not really help her.  \n   • Diane – dislikes Rachel and might want to embarrass her, yet she was the one who screamed and called everybody down; a thief rarely calls attention to the crime.  \n   • Jack (real dog) – would love to eat a turkey, but a 20-pound bird would leave a great deal of scattered meat and bones, not an empty platter.  \n   • Chris – finds the whole visit boring and repeatedly says that anything that shortens the visit would please him.  Spoiling the main course would be a perfect way to hurry the family back to the hotel or on the road.\n\n2. Opportunity\n   Only four beings were indoors when the turkey vanished: Rachel, Diane, Jack and Chris.  \n   • Rachel was in the kitchen, in full view of several people who were drifting in and out for drinks and snacks.  \n   • Diane was asleep until the crash of the platter woke her; several people confirm seeing her go upstairs to nap.  \n   • Jack can go anywhere but cannot open the basement refrigerator and certainly cannot carry off a slick, heavy, half-thawed turkey.  \n   • Chris was left completely unsupervised with his remote-control robotic dog.\n\n3. Physical evidence\n   • A trail of muddy DOG paw-prints leads from the basement steps to the chair and the spot where the turkey had sat.  \n   • When the robot dog later tumbles down the stairs it leaves prints identical in size, spacing and tread to the earlier muddy prints.  Grandfather notices the match at once.  \n   • A real dog’s paw is soft and splayed; the toy’s molded pads are perfectly round and equidistant – an obvious match once you look closely.  \n   • The robot is far too small to drag off a turkey; therefore a HUMAN must have carried the bird while planting the paw-prints as a decoy.  The only human who had the toy – and who had reason to create the decoy – is Chris.\n\n4. Deduction\n   a) The paw-prints prove the robot dog, not Jack, was in the basement.  \n   b) The robot cannot go downstairs by itself; it must be driven by its hand-held controller.  Only Chris had that controller.  \n   c) Therefore Chris was in (or just outside) the basement with the turkey when it disappeared.  \n   d) Chris’s oft-stated wish to “get this over with” gives him a clear motive to sabotage dinner.  \n   e) No one else had both the means (controller) and the motive (ending the visit) to perpetrate the theft.\n\nHence Chris is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRachel Olem, Diane Olem, Chris Olem, Jack (the real dog), the robotic dog\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nChristopher “Chris” Olem\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBored and resentful at being dragged to another tedious family Thanksgiving, Chris decided to ruin the meal so that the gathering would break up early.  While most of the family played football outside and Rachel busied herself upstairs in the kitchen, Chris slipped the turkey off the basement table, carried it up the outside cellar steps and hid it in the trunk of his parents’ car.\n\nTo divert suspicion he staged a trail that pointed to the dogs.  He carried his remote-control robotic dog into the muddy side yard, pressed its paws into the soft ground, then guided it down the basement steps.  He lifted the toy onto the chair and across the table so that it would leave a neat set of muddy paw-prints right up to the platter.  The prints would naturally suggest that a dog—preferably Jack—had eaten or dragged off the bird.  Chris then regained the first floor, set the robot waddling aimlessly by a wall and pocketed the controller.\n\nWhen Aunt Diane awoke and came downstairs for a look at the turkey she found only an empty plate and screamed.  A few minutes later the still-active robot wandered to the head of the cellar stairs and, lacking Chris’s guidance, toppled down them.  The fresh prints it left on the steps exactly matched the muddy prints already at the crime scene, giving Grandfather the key comparison he needed.  Realising that only the owner of the robot could have planted those tracks, he identified Chris as the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Aunt Rachel – Overworked and exasperated, yes, but she would have to feed everyone something else if the turkey vanished, making her job harder, not easier.  She never touched the robot dog or had time alone downstairs.\n\n• Aunt Diane – She dislikes Rachel but had been upstairs napping (witnessed) and was the first to raise the alarm.  Nothing links her to the paw-prints or the toy.\n\n• Jack (real dog) – Could not have left the distinctive molded-pad prints that match the robot.  A small terrier also could not drag away a large bird without leaving scraps and feathers.\n\n• The robotic dog itself – Lacks the strength and dexterity to remove a twenty-pound turkey; it was merely the tool manipulated by Chris.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

Why would I?”\n“Well I think I know the reason.” Grandfather said. “ You see, Chris, it was hard to come to this conclusion with everything else clouding my thoughts. Your aunt, for example, seemed relieved when the turkey was gone; but as she so pointedly said, she’s already done a lot of work today—I doubt she’d let it all go to waste.”\n“Well that makes sense,” admitted Chris.\n“I might have accused your mother, if she hadn’t just been woken from her nap by all the commotion. No, it’s the muddy dog prints leading right up to the table that the turkey was once on that are the biggest clue. They would lead me to believe the culprit was Jack here, if not for one thing: Jack is a small dog, and could in no way move a turkey very far, let alone get it off the table.”\n“So how did the prints get there?” asked Aunt Rachel. The answer came with the yipping of Chris’s bionic dog.\n“Chris covered his robotic dog’s feet in mud to frame Jack for the crime, so he could move the turkey. He wanted to disrupt the dinner so that you all would argue, and he’d get to leave earlier. He does, after all, hate these occasions.”\nAt this point, Chris finally gave in. “You’re right,” said the young boy, but there was no genuine regret on his face, other than the regret of being caught. “I’m so sorry, Mom!”\n“Sorry is not good enough, young man,” she said, grabbing him by the ear. “And as punishment, not only do you have to stay, but you have to help your Aunt Rachel do the cooking, is that clear?”\nHe nodded.\n“Why don’t we all help with the cooking?” suggested Grandfather.\nSo once Chris had retrieved the turkey from his hiding place (a closet in the basement), the family worked together to make the best Thanksgiving dinner they had ever had.",

He does, after all, hate these occasions.”\nAt this point, Chris finally gave in. “You’re right,” said the young boy, but there was no genuine regret on his face, other than the regret of being caught. “I’m so sorry, Mom!”\n“Sorry is not good enough, young man,” she said, grabbing him by the ear. “And as punishment, not only do you have to stay, but you have to help your Aunt Rachel do the cooking, is that clear?”\nHe nodded.\n“Why don’t we all help with the cooking?” suggested Grandfather.\nSo once Chris had retrieved the turkey from his hiding place (a closet in the basement), the family worked together to make the best Thanksgiving dinner they had ever had."
