    "full_text": "Two dogs walked side by side. One gave a hollow yip and the other barked in response. When the first dog wagged its tail, the second dog bit at it. The second dog was startled by the presence of the first, which was a robotic toy, and had been brought by one of the relatives as the Olem family piled into Aunt Rachel’s house for Thanksgiving. Cousin Chris had brought along the robotic dog for his amusement, but Jack—the actual dog— was not at all pleased by its intrusion. It was much like a dog in the way it acted, and was small, but almost the same size as little Jack. The toy was little better than something sold at Wal-Mart, but still surprisingly detailed. Even its paws looked incredibly realistic. Chris was watching his aunt, Rachel Olem, while she worked furiously in the kitchen preparing a meal for the family. Like every year, they’d all come to temporarily board in her home as she waited on them hand and foot. She seemed as annoyed to have all the visitors as Chris was annoyed to be there; he was not one for holiday trips to see family, and he figured the sooner they got it over with the better. All of this was well known amongst the family, and yet they made no effort to help Rachel, nor did they seek to entertain Chris. Everything seemed to be going routinely (other than the robotic dog), until a shriek came from the basement. Jack, his tail between his legs, was the first react, darting underneath the table while his robotic counterpart found itself walking steadily into a wall. The family—most of whom had been playing football outside—quickly went downstairs, abandoning their usual activities. There they found Aunt Diane, Rachel Olem’s sister-in-law, standing over the table that had once been the bearer of a soon-to-be-cooked turkey. She was furious. “The turkey is gone!” she screamed, spit flying from her mouth. Rachel looked relieved, and some of the family members noticed. But the rest of the family was in an uproar. Accusations began to fly. Before things could get too out of hand, Rachel’s father stepped forward, silencing everyone with a raised hand. He knew that most everyone in the family had just come in from outdoors, and correctly assumed that the turkey culprit would have to have been someone indoors. Diane, Aunt Rachel, the dog Jack and Chris were the main suspects. He quickly dismissed everyone else, and turned to the remaining group. He first turned to Rachel, but not without noticing a set of muddy dog prints leading from the basement steps to the table, and even to the chair that had been right in front of the spot the turkey once sat. Noticing Jack was not present, he spoke to Rachel. “Rachel, isn’t it true that you are always stressed, and even reluctant, to have these family get-togethers?” Rachel did not deny it. “Yes, I’ve already been cooking for hours on end today—I’ve put a lot of work into this meal.” Chris, who had been staring off into space, was the next to wither under his grandfather’s accusing eye. “ Chris, isn’t it true, in your case, that you also do not like these get-togethers, because you find them boring and unappealing?” “Yeah, whatever,” Chris said apathetically. If dogs could talk, the grandfather thought, Jack would be the next one to accuse. He shrugged at the thought and turned on his daughter-in-law, the wife of his eldest son and Chris’s mother. But before he could speak, his daughter Rachel was seething over being accused by her own father. “You can’t honestly believe it was me, can you? I work hard every year to please you ingrates, and this is what I get? If anyone, it was my darling sister-in-law! She’s always hated me since my brother introduced me to her! She just wants to make me look bad!” “Nice going, Mom,” said Chris, who still seemed like he wouldn’t care if the house blew down at the moment. “Now my own son is turning against me?” Diane gasped. “I don’t actually think it’s you, Mom. I just figure you two fighting could mean we’ll get to leave earlier.” Chris’s comment sparked the elderly man’s interest. “Always so selfish, Chris,” Diane said. “Even now you can’t cut me a break, despite the fact that this nonsense woke me up from a nap after driving us here for hours!” Grandfather raised a hand to yet again silence them all. He turned on Diane. “Diane, is it true that you hold ill feelings toward your sister-in-law?” Diane looked reluctant to confirm this notion, but after a moment her shoulders sagged, and her head bobbed up and down. Crash. Small footsteps could be heard padding down the steps, followed by a thunk as something much heavier and harder fell in its wake. When they looked to the staircase, they saw Jack running from the meandering bionic dog, which had taken a tumble down the steps. Jack managed to get off the last landing before Chris’s substitute dog landed on it, and so Jack quickly darted behind Grandfather’s legs. “Well that gives me an idea,” he said as the robotic dog left footprints in its wake. The three family members had begun fighting again, while Jack had recommenced yipping at the bionic intrusion. Grandfather did not subtly call for silence; this time he barked—in a volume much louder than Jack could ever muster—for them to shut up. When they had quieted down, Grandfather spoke. “ I believe I know who has stolen the turkey.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Read the story twice, noting every explicit ­– and implied – fact that could possibly matter. \n   • Who was IN the house when the cry “The turkey is gone!” was heard?  \n     ‑ Only Aunt Rachel (cooking), Cousin Chris (with his toy dog), Jack the real dog.  \n     ‑ Diane was not “inside and awake” until the scream itself – she came down the steps at that moment.  \n     ‑ Everyone else (including Grand-father) was outdoors playing football.  \n   • Physical clue: a continuous track of muddy, four-toed prints that look exactly like a small dog’s.  \n     The track runs from the bottom of the basement stairs to a chair pushed up against the turkey table.  \n   • The toy dog’s selling point is that its paws are “incredibly realistic”, almost indistinguishable from a real dog’s, and it is about the same size as Jack.  \n   • When the bionic dog later tumbles down the steps it again leaves a distinctive print.  \n     Grandfather immediately says “Well that gives me an idea,” i.e. the new prints match the muddy set he saw earlier.  \n   • Jack the real dog is small; even if he could reach the table, he could not lift or carry away an entire raw turkey that an adult has trouble lifting.  \n   • The toy dog cannot lift a turkey either; therefore SOME HUMAN must have removed it.  \n   • Of the three people inside, who had a REASON to want the turkey gone?  \n        – Aunt Rachel: tired of cooking every year, but losing the turkey would embarrass her, not help her.  \n        – Aunt Diane: she dislikes Rachel, but she was asleep in a car until moments before the scream.  \n        – Cousin Chris: openly states that he finds these gatherings boring and wants to leave as quickly as possible. Having no turkey would end Thanksgiving prematurely – exactly what he says he wants.  \n   • Who had a way to SHIFT BLAME off a human? Only Chris, by using his realistic-pawed robot to create “dog” tracks.  \n\n2.  Scenario that explains every fact with no contradictions:  \n   – Chris sneaks the turkey away while Rachel is upstairs.  \n   – He first takes the toy dog outside, lets its rubber paws pick up mud, then drives it down the basement steps by remote control.  \n   – He walks behind it, carrying the turkey, but lets the muddy robot run from the steps to the chair, jump (or be lifted) onto the chair and then wander off.  \n     Result: a perfect muddy “dog trail” that points to an animal culprit.  \n   – Chris then hides the bird (trash bin, car-boot, wherever) and returns to the ground floor.  \n   – When Diane later goes down to start work on the bird she finds it gone and screams.  \n   – At that instant the robot is wandering upstairs, bumping into a wall (exactly where Chris left it).  \n\n3.  Why Grandfather solves it when the robot falls:  \n   – He sees the newly-made pawprints left on the steps by the tumbling toy.  \n   – They are identical in spacing and shape to the muddy track he has just examined, proving the earlier prints were NOT Jack’s but the robot’s.  \n   – A robot cannot steal a 20-pound turkey; it must have had a human partner.  \n   – The only person inside who both disliked the gathering and had control of the robot is Chris.  \n   – Therefore Chris is the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAunt Rachel Olem, Aunt Diane Olem, Cousin Chris Olem, Jack (the real dog)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCousin Chris Olem\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone  (the robotic dog is an inanimate tool, not an accomplice)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. While most of the family is outside, Chris decides to sabotage Thanksgiving so that the visit will end early.  \n2. He takes his lifelike robotic dog into the yard, allowing mud to clog its realistic rubber paws.  \n3. He then drives the toy down the basement stairs by remote control, making sure it leaves a clear muddy track.  \n4. Carrying the turkey himself, he follows the robot, lifts it briefly onto the chair so more prints appear there, then lets it wander off.  \n5. Chris hides the turkey (garage freezer, car boot—location immaterial to the logic), returns upstairs and leaves the robot bumping harmlessly against a wall.  \n6. Diane later goes down, finds the turkey missing and screams.  \n7. The family rushes down; Grandfather notices the muddy “dog” prints.  \n8. Minutes later, the robot—still on autonomous mode—ambles to the basement stairs, falls, and again prints its tracks. Grandfather matches the two sets of prints and realises the robot, not Jack, was the source of the first trail.  \n9. Since only Chris had the means and motive to use the robot, Grandfather concludes—and announces—that Chris stole the turkey.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAunt Rachel: Although she grumbled about the workload, losing the main course would humiliate her, not help her, and she had been continuously in the kitchen under Chris’s eyes. She had no access to the robot that forged the prints.  \nAunt Diane: She was asleep in the car until the scream; multiple witnesses saw her arrive only after the turkey was already missing. She also could not have set down the robot prints.  \nJack the dog: The turkey was far too heavy for the small dog to remove, and the match between the robot’s fresh prints and the earlier muddy ones proves the trail was made by the toy, not by Jack.  \nTherefore none of them could have engineered the disappearance; only Chris could—and did—do so.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "“Chris!” Grandfather shouted. “It was you!”\nFor the first time since he had arrived, Chris finally seemed to be paying attention to his surroundings. “What? No! Why would I?”\n“Well I think I know the reason.” Grandfather said. “ You see, Chris, it was hard to come to this conclusion with everything else clouding my thoughts. Your aunt, for example, seemed relieved when the turkey was gone; but as she so pointedly said, she’s already done a lot of work today—I doubt she’d let it all go to waste.”\n“Well that makes sense,” admitted Chris.\n“I might have accused your mother, if she hadn’t just been woken from her nap by all the commotion. No, it’s the muddy dog prints leading right up to the table that the turkey was once on that are the biggest clue. They would lead me to believe the culprit was Jack here, if not for one thing: Jack is a small dog, and could in no way move a turkey very far, let alone get it off the table.”\n“So how did the prints get there?” asked Aunt Rachel. The answer came with the yipping of Chris’s bionic dog.\n“Chris covered his robotic dog’s feet in mud to frame Jack for the crime, so he could move the turkey. He wanted to disrupt the dinner so that you all would argue, and he’d get to leave earlier. He does, after all, hate these occasions.”\nAt this point, Chris finally gave in. “You’re right,” said the young boy, but there was no genuine regret on his face, other than the regret of being caught. “I’m so sorry, Mom!”\n“Sorry is not good enough, young man,” she said, grabbing him by the ear. “And as punishment, not only do you have to stay, but you have to help your Aunt Rachel do the cooking, is that clear?”\nHe nodded.\n“Why don’t we all help with the cooking?” suggested Grandfather.\nSo once Chris had retrieved the turkey from his hiding place (a closet in the basement), the family worked together to make the best Thanksgiving dinner they had ever had.",

Your aunt, for example, seemed relieved when the turkey was gone; but as she so pointedly said, she’s already done a lot of work today—I doubt she’d let it all go to waste.”\n“Well that makes sense,” admitted Chris.\n“I might have accused your mother, if she hadn’t just been woken from her nap by all the commotion. No, it’s the muddy dog prints leading right up to the table that the turkey was once on that are the biggest clue. They would lead me to believe the culprit was Jack here, if not for one thing: Jack is a small dog, and could in no way move a turkey very far, let alone get it off the table.”\n“So how did the prints get there?” asked Aunt Rachel. The answer came with the yipping of Chris’s bionic dog.\n“Chris covered his robotic dog’s feet in mud to frame Jack for the crime, so he could move the turkey. He wanted to disrupt the dinner so that you all would argue, and he’d get to leave earlier. He does, after all, hate these occasions.”\nAt this point, Chris finally gave in. “You’re right,” said the young boy, but there was no genuine regret on his face, other than the regret of being caught. “I’m so sorry, Mom!”\n“Sorry is not good enough, young man,” she said, grabbing him by the ear. “And as punishment, not only do you have to stay, but you have to help your Aunt Rachel do the cooking, is that clear?”\nHe nodded.\n“Why don’t we all help with the cooking?” suggested Grandfather.\nSo once Chris had retrieved the turkey from his hiding place (a closet in the basement), the family worked together to make the best Thanksgiving dinner they had ever had."
