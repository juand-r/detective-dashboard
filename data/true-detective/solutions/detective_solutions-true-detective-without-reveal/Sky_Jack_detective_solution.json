    "full_text": "Sergeant Saunders of Scotland Yard hung up the telephone and turned to his superior who was studying a map of the world tacked to one wall of his office. “No luck finding the money yet, sir,” Saunders reported. “A knapsack full of two-hundred-thousand American dollars is a tricky thing to track down in all that expanse.” Chief Inspector Langford turned away from the map, spun the large globe that sat on a corner of his desk. “Quite,” he agreed. “Perhaps the Flying Bandit himself can help us out with the search. Once we capture him.” He placed his cold pipe between his teeth and took a couple of smokeless puffs. The Chief Inspector was a non-smoker, but he felt that his position required a pipe for dramatic effect. Thus, he always carried one for show but would never light it. Saunders nodded. “Right, we know he took off from a Long Island airfield after he robbed the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City, and that he landed on the outskirts of Liverpool fifteen hours later – witnesses identified the plane taking off and landing at those two points. Given the time interval, and an airspeed of 200 miles-per-hour, we know he took the most direct route to get to England, approximately 3,000 miles as the crow, or bandit, flies. It was a one-man flight his fellow countryman, Charles Lindbergh, would’ve been proud of.” “And almost exactly thirty years to the day that Lindy landed in Paris,” Langford mused, tracing Lindbergh’s solo route with his finger on the globe. “We also know,” Saunders continued, “that the Flying Bandit lost the knapsack full of money approximately five hours into his getaway flight. We surmise that from the fact that the American police heard a scream of anguish as he was bragging to them on the radio about his ‘perfect’ crime and getaway. They believe he was dangling the loot out the window of the plane in a fit of showmanship and dropped it.” “Yes, quite. Bad luck on his part,” Langford murmured. The tall, gaunt man with the pork chop sideburns jabbed a spot on the globe with a bony finger, indicating the probable location of the money drop. “But he continued on-course all the way to Liverpool, probably figuring the Americans would have their own planes out looking for him,” Saunders went on. “But now that things have cooled down a bit, he’ll be anxious to retrace his route and find that knapsack of cash he let slip out of his fingers.” “Commendable summary of the known facts, Saunders,” Langford commented dryly. “With all British exit points on high alert, we’re certain to-” The phone rang again. Sergeant Saunders scooped it up, listened for a moment, said, “Right-o!”, and then pronged the receiver. “They’ve rounded up four men trying to leave the country who match the Flying Bandit’s general description, sir. They’re in the holding cells right now, waiting to be questioned.” Chief Inspector Langford smiled, tapping his teeth with his black pipe stem. “Good. We’re fortunate the man’s aircraft broke both wheels upon landing, or he’d certainly have used that bird to fly the coop undetected from our shores. His bad luck, again.” The man in Holding Cell 1 at Scotland Yard was David Loftkiss, a jeweler by profession, so he claimed, in the United Kingdom on business. “Mr. Loftkiss was stopped by the Southampton constabulary trying to board the SS United States bound for New York City,” Saunders summarized the report he’d received. “I have urgent business in New York!” Loftkiss exclaimed, rising out of his chair. “Why are you holding me up?” Langford calmly compared the man’s face to the police sketch the Yard had received of the Flying Bandit, based on the bank president’s description. “Indeed. Urgent business, you say? Why not take a plane, then, Mr. Loftkiss? Why take an ocean liner?” The man sat back down, his face pale. “I-I’m afraid of flying. I don’t trust those propellers to keep spinning – so high up in the air. So I take boats whenever I go overseas. And the SS United States is the fastest ocean liner on the waters. No stops.” “Hmmm,” Langford commented. “This is 1957, Mr. Loftkiss,” Saunders stated. “Air safety has improved considerably since your country’s barnstorming days.” “Maybe. But I don’t take any chances. So, can I-” The two policemen moved on to Holding Cell 2. Sitting on a wobbly wooden chair at a worn wooden table was Cliff Snelling, artist, so he claimed. The resemblance between him and the Flying Bandit, as with Loftkiss, was strong. Langford contemplatively tapped his pipe, and said, “Paint me a picture, Mr. Snelling. Why were you attempting to board a ferry at Holyhead, bound for Dublin, Ireland? Perhaps trying to retrace your original flight path after the robbery?” “What? What ‘flight path’!” Snelling exploded, exhibiting a highly volatile artistic temperament, if nothing else. “I’ve been commissioned to paint some horses at Lord Harding’s Irish estate,” the agitated man added. “That’s why I was taking the ferry to Dublin. Please, I-” “And to think I always thought horses came with their own natural coloring,” Langford deadpanned to his assistant. The two men moved on to Holding Cell 3. Wherein, a Mr. Tom Jenks presided over a stony-faced silence, his arms folded across his chest. “You were picked up at Heathrow Airport,” the Chief Inspector stated, drawing upon his cold pipe as he did so the facts. “What was your exact intended destination, sir?” “Blow it out your briar, bobby!” Jenks retorted. “I’m suing you blokes for false arrest and imprisonment. This is how you treat American tourists – after we won the war for you!” “Yes, well, we’re all very grateful for that, I’m sure,” Langford puffed. “The airline says he was bound for Gander, Newfoundland, sir,” Sergeant Saunders informed his superior. “More tourism,” Jenks said. “I thought I’d see some of Canada on my way back to New York, that’s all. Now, you flatfoots had better-” The two policemen exchanged glances, and then moved on to Holding Cell 4. Occupying this barren, yellow-walled room was Clem Duster. “As I told the coppers who picked me up at the airfield, I was just renting a plane to do some pleasure-flying while I was in Manchester. I was a pilot in the Army Air Force during the war, see, and-” “Those ‘coppers’,” Langford interrupted, “found a flight plan to Iceland in that rented plane of yours, Mr. Duster. Iceland seems a tad far for a ‘pleasure flight’, doesn’t it?” “Okay, okay!” the man conceded. “Don’t tell my wife, but I met this dame, Miss Iceland, at a beauty pageant in New York a few weeks ago, and she told me about all these great hot springs they have in her home country. So, with my skin condition and all, I figured …” The two policemen left the cell and returned to Langford’s office. The Chief Inspector’s pipe was cold, but not the trail to nabbing the Flying Bandit. “Well, I’d say we’ve got our chap, wouldn’t you, Saunders?” The Sergeant nodded, his ginger mustache bristling upwards into a smile. “Shall I go get him out of the holding cell and bring him in here to be formally charged?” Langford knocked his pipe against the globe on his desk over the general area where the stolen money had been dropped. “Quite. And by the least circuitous route possible, if you don’t mind,” he added, his sky-blue eyes twinkling.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What does the Yard already know?\n    •  The Flying Bandit flew a small aircraft from Long Island (New York) to Liverpool (England).  \n    •  The distance is roughly 3,000 mi and at 200 mph took 15 h – a straight “great-circle” route.  \n    •  Exactly 5 h (≈1,000 mi) after the start he accidently let the $200,000 knapsack fall out.  \n       Therefore the money is lying about 1,000 mi east of New York, i.e. very close to Gander,\n       Newfoundland (the familiar mid-Atlantic refuelling point in 1957).\n\n2.  What will the Bandit do now?\n    •  He must come back to Britain first (his aircraft’s wheels broke on landing).  \n    •  As soon as the heat dies down he will try to reach the Gander/Newfoundland area to pick up his loot.  \n    •  A direct flight from London to Gander is therefore the quickest, least‐circuitous way to his treasure.\n\n3.  Check the four detainees against that single requirement – “Who is headed straight for Gander?”\n    A.  David Loftkiss – boarding the S.S. United States for New York.  \n        •  Claims he is afraid of flying (hardly the psychology of a man who has just crossed the Atlantic solo).  \n        •  New York is 1,000 mi away from where the money lies, so it is the wrong destination altogether.\n\n    B.  Cliff Snelling – taking a ferry to Dublin.  \n        •  Ireland is due west of Liverpool, but again ≈2,000 mi east of the drop-zone; a needless detour.\n\n    C.  Tom Jenks – at Heathrow, ticketed for Gander, Newfoundland.  \n        •  Gander is almost the precise point where the loot was lost.  \n        •  He is travelling exactly where the Bandit must go, by the most direct, fastest means: an airliner.\n\n    D.  Clem Duster – renting a small plane filed for Iceland.  \n        •  Iceland lies far to the north-east of the drop-zone; it is a very round-about route.  \n        •  Taking a light plane over 1,000 mi of open ocean in 1957 suggests pleasure flying rather than a\n          carefully planned recovery mission.\n\n4.  Additional behavioural clues\n    •  Jenks alone shows the brash, cocky attitude the bank robber displayed on the radio (“Blow it out\n      your briar, bobby!” sounds like the same man who taunted the New-York police).  \n    •  Loftkiss says he is scared of propellers; the Bandit trusted a single-engine craft for fifteen hours.  \n    •  Duster at least admits to being a pilot, but chooses Iceland instead of the obvious target.  \n    •  Snelling’s “artist temperament” explains his volatility but not a secret knowledge of aviation.\n\n5.  “Least circuitous route”\n    •  Chief Inspector Langford’s parting joke to Saunders mirrors the crook’s plan – go straight to the goal.\n      Only Jenks has chosen that least-circuitous route: London → Gander.\n\nTherefore, Tom Jenks must be the Flying Bandit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDavid Loftkiss, Cliff Snelling, Tom Jenks, Clem Duster\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nTom Jenks\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1.  18 May 1957 – The Flying Bandit robs the Chase Manhattan Bank, stuffs $200,000 in a knapsack, and\n    takes off solo from a Long Island airfield in a light aircraft.\n2.  Roughly five hours and 1,000 mi into the Atlantic crossing, he leans out of the cockpit to brag over\n    the radio and accidentally drops the bag.  It splashes down close to the Newfoundland coast, almost on\n    the approaches to Gander.\n3.  He completes the remaining ten-hour flight and lands on a makeshift field near Liverpool, cracking the\n    landing gear.\n4.  Forced to remain in Britain while the aircraft is repaired, he keeps a low profile—until he thinks the\n    search has cooled off.\n5.  Believing Scotland Yard will watch outgoing flights to the United States, he buys a ticket only to\n    Gander, planning to rent another small plane or a boat there, find the floating—or beached—knapsack,\n    and then continue on to New York with the cash.\n6.  Heathrow security, alerted to any American matching the sketch, detains him.  His planned destination\n    (Gander) is the very spot indicated on Langford’s globe, confirming the Yard’s suspicions.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  David Loftkiss – Truly avoids flying; elected a slow ocean voyage that bypasses the Newfoundland\n   coastline altogether.  Anxious and pale because of missed business, not guilt.\n\n•  Cliff Snelling – Produces corroborating letters about his horse-portrait commission.  Travelling by\n   ferry, not aircraft, and Dublin is nowhere near the money’s drop-zone.\n\n•  Clem Duster – A genuine ex-Army pilot fascinated by hot springs (and evidently by beauty queens).\n   His filed flight plan and personal medical papers about a skin ailment support his story.  Iceland is\n   hundreds of miles north-east of the cash.\n\nNone of them is heading straight for the only logical target: Gander, Newfoundland.  Only Tom Jenks is.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The Flying Bandit inadvertently dropped the knapsack full of stolen cash out of his plane five hours and one thousand miles into his getaway flight from Long Island to Liverpool. Which would’ve put his plane over Newfoundland, Canada at the time, as the shortest air route from the northern US to England, due to the curvature of the earth, travels over Newfoundland. Just as Charles Lindbergh’s flight path did back in 1927, when he became the first man to fly solo from America to Europe.\nLooking at a map can be deceiving, as it shows the world as flat. But using a globe, and then tracing the shortest distance between New York and England, will mean passing through Newfoundland. The Great Circle Route, as it’s called. Therefore, Tom Jenks is the Flying Bandit, as he’s the only one of the four suspects trying to get directly back to Newfoundland, to attempt to retrieve his lost loot.",

Given the time interval, and an airspeed of 200 miles-per-hour, we know he took the most direct route to get to England, approximately 3,000 miles as the crow, or bandit, flies. It was a one-man flight his fellow countryman, Charles Lindbergh, would’ve been proud of.” “And almost exactly thirty years to the day that Lindy landed in Paris,” Langford mused, tracing Lindbergh’s solo route with his finger on the globe. “We also know,” Saunders continued, “that the Flying Bandit lost the knapsack full of money approximately five hours into his getaway flight. We surmise that from the fact that the American police heard a scream of anguish as he was bragging to them on the radio about his ‘perfect’ crime and getaway. They believe he was dangling the loot out the window of the plane in a fit of showmanship and dropped it.” “Yes, quite. Bad luck on his part,” Langford murmured. The tall, gaunt man with the pork chop sideburns jabbed a spot on the globe with a bony finger, indicating the probable location of the money drop. “But he continued on-course all the way to Liverpool, probably figuring the Americans would have their own planes out looking for him,” Saunders went on. “But now that things have cooled down a bit, he’ll be anxious to retrace his route and find that knapsack of cash he let slip out of his fingers.” “Commendable summary of the known facts, Saunders,” Langford commented dryly. “With all British exit points on high alert, we’re certain to-” The phone rang again. Sergeant Saunders scooped it up, listened for a moment, said, “Right-o!”, and then pronged the receiver. “They’ve rounded up four men trying to leave the country who match the Flying Bandit’s general description, sir. They’re in the holding cells right now, waiting to be questioned.” Chief Inspector Langford smiled, tapping his teeth with his black pipe stem. “Good. We’re fortunate the man’s aircraft broke both wheels upon landing, or he’d certainly have used that bird to fly the coop undetected from our shores. His bad luck, again.” The man in Holding Cell 1 at Scotland Yard was David Loftkiss, a jeweler by profession, so he claimed, in the United Kingdom on business. “Mr. Loftkiss was stopped by the Southampton constabulary trying to board the SS United States bound for New York City,” Saunders summarized the report he’d received. “I have urgent business in New York!” Loftkiss exclaimed, rising out of his chair. “Why are you holding me up?” Langford calmly compared the man’s face to the police sketch the Yard had received of the Flying Bandit, based on the bank president’s description. “Indeed. Urgent business, you say? Why not take a plane, then, Mr. Loftkiss? Why take an ocean liner?” The man sat back down, his face pale. “I-I’m afraid of flying. I don’t trust those propellers to keep spinning – so high up in the air. So I take boats whenever I go overseas. And the SS United States is the fastest ocean liner on the waters. No stops.” “Hmmm,” Langford commented. “This is 1957, Mr. Loftkiss,” Saunders stated. “Air safety has improved considerably since your country’s barnstorming days.” “Maybe. But I don’t take any chances. So, can I-” The two policemen moved on to Holding Cell 2. Sitting on a wobbly wooden chair at a worn wooden table was Cliff Snelling, artist, so he claimed. The resemblance between him and the Flying Bandit, as with Loftkiss, was strong. Langford contemplatively tapped his pipe, and said, “Paint me a picture, Mr. Snelling. Why were you attempting to board a ferry at Holyhead, bound for Dublin, Ireland? Perhaps trying to retrace your original flight path after the robbery?” “What? What ‘flight path’!” Snelling exploded, exhibiting a highly volatile artistic temperament, if nothing else. “I’ve been commissioned to paint some horses at Lord Harding’s Irish estate,” the agitated man added. “That’s why I was taking the ferry to Dublin. Please, I-” “And to think I always thought horses came with their own natural coloring,” Langford deadpanned to his assistant. The two men moved on to Holding Cell 3. Wherein, a Mr. Tom Jenks presided over a stony-faced silence, his arms folded across his chest. “You were picked up at Heathrow Airport,” the Chief Inspector stated, drawing upon his cold pipe as he did so the facts. “What was your exact intended destination, sir?” “Blow it out your briar, bobby!” Jenks retorted. “I’m suing you blokes for false arrest and imprisonment. This is how you treat American tourists – after we won the war for you!” “Yes, well, we’re all very grateful for that, I’m sure,” Langford puffed. “The airline says he was bound for Gander, Newfoundland, sir,” Sergeant Saunders informed his superior. “More tourism,” Jenks said. “I thought I’d see some of Canada on my way back to New York, that’s all. Now, you flatfoots had better-” The two policemen exchanged glances, and then moved on to Holding Cell 4. Occupying this barren, yellow-walled room was Clem Duster. “As I told the coppers who picked me up at the airfield, I was just renting a plane to do some pleasure-flying while I was in Manchester. I was a pilot in the Army Air Force during the war, see, and-” “Those ‘coppers’,” Langford interrupted, “found a flight plan to Iceland in that rented plane of yours, Mr. Duster. Iceland seems a tad far for a ‘pleasure flight’, doesn’t it?” “Okay, okay!” the man conceded. “Don’t tell my wife, but I met this dame, Miss Iceland, at a beauty pageant in New York a few weeks ago, and she told me about all these great hot springs they have in her home country. So, with my skin condition and all, I figured …” The two policemen left the cell and returned to Langford’s office. The Chief Inspector’s pipe was cold, but not the trail to nabbing the Flying Bandit. “Well, I’d say we’ve got our chap, wouldn’t you, Saunders?” The Sergeant nodded, his ginger mustache bristling upwards into a smile. “Shall I go get him out of the holding cell and bring him in here to be formally charged?” Langford knocked his pipe against the globe on his desk over the general area where the stolen money had been dropped. “Quite. And by the least circuitous route possible, if you don’t mind,” he added, his sky-blue eyes twinkling.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Clem Duster; (b) Cliff Snelling; (c) David Loftkiss; (d) Tom Jenks",
      "answer": "(d) Tom Jenks",
      "outcome": "The Flying Bandit inadvertently dropped the knapsack full of stolen cash out of his plane five hours and one thousand miles into his getaway flight from Long Island to Liverpool. Which would’ve put his plane over Newfoundland, Canada at the time, as the shortest air route from the northern US to England, due to the curvature of the earth, travels over Newfoundland. Just as Charles Lindbergh’s flight path did back in 1927, when he became the first man to fly solo from America to Europe.\nLooking at a map can be deceiving, as it shows the world as flat. But using a globe, and then tracing the shortest distance between New York and England, will mean passing through Newfoundland. The Great Circle Route, as it’s called. Therefore, Tom Jenks is the Flying Bandit, as he’s the only one of the four suspects trying to get directly back to Newfoundland, to attempt to retrieve his lost loot."
