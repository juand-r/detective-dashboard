    "full_text": "Sergeant Saunders of Scotland Yard hung up the telephone and turned to his superior who was studying a map of the world tacked to one wall of his office. “No luck finding the money yet, sir,” Saunders reported. “A knapsack full of two-hundred-thousand American dollars is a tricky thing to track down in all that expanse.” Chief Inspector Langford turned away from the map, spun the large globe that sat on a corner of his desk. “Quite,” he agreed. “Perhaps the Flying Bandit himself can help us out with the search. Once we capture him.” He placed his cold pipe between his teeth and took a couple of smokeless puffs. The Chief Inspector was a non-smoker, but he felt that his position required a pipe for dramatic effect. Thus, he always carried one for show but would never light it. Saunders nodded. “Right, we know he took off from a Long Island airfield after he robbed the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City, and that he landed on the outskirts of Liverpool fifteen hours later – witnesses identified the plane taking off and landing at those two points. Given the time interval, and an airspeed of 200 miles-per-hour, we know he took the most direct route to get to England, approximately 3,000 miles as the crow, or bandit, flies. It was a one-man flight his fellow countryman, Charles Lindbergh, would’ve been proud of.” “And almost exactly thirty years to the day that Lindy landed in Paris,” Langford mused, tracing Lindbergh’s solo route with his finger on the globe. “We also know,” Saunders continued, “that the Flying Bandit lost the knapsack full of money approximately five hours into his getaway flight. We surmise that from the fact that the American police heard a scream of anguish as he was bragging to them on the radio about his ‘perfect’ crime and getaway. They believe he was dangling the loot out the window of the plane in a fit of showmanship and dropped it.” “Yes, quite. Bad luck on his part,” Langford murmured. The tall, gaunt man with the pork chop sideburns jabbed a spot on the globe with a bony finger, indicating the probable location of the money drop. “But he continued on-course all the way to Liverpool, probably figuring the Americans would have their own planes out looking for him,” Saunders went on. “But now that things have cooled down a bit, he’ll be anxious to retrace his route and find that knapsack of cash he let slip out of his fingers.” “Commendable summary of the known facts, Saunders,” Langford commented dryly. “With all British exit points on high alert, we’re certain to-” The phone rang again. Sergeant Saunders scooped it up, listened for a moment, said, “Right-o!”, and then pronged the receiver. “They’ve rounded up four men trying to leave the country who match the Flying Bandit’s general description, sir. They’re in the holding cells right now, waiting to be questioned.” Chief Inspector Langford smiled, tapping his teeth with his black pipe stem. “Good. We’re fortunate the man’s aircraft broke both wheels upon landing, or he’d certainly have used that bird to fly the coop undetected from our shores. His bad luck, again.” The man in Holding Cell 1 at Scotland Yard was David Loftkiss, a jeweler by profession, so he claimed, in the United Kingdom on business. “Mr. Loftkiss was stopped by the Southampton constabulary trying to board the SS United States bound for New York City,” Saunders summarized the report he’d received. “I have urgent business in New York!” Loftkiss exclaimed, rising out of his chair. “Why are you holding me up?” Langford calmly compared the man’s face to the police sketch the Yard had received of the Flying Bandit, based on the bank president’s description. “Indeed. Urgent business, you say? Why not take a plane, then, Mr. Loftkiss? Why take an ocean liner?” The man sat back down, his face pale. “I-I’m afraid of flying. I don’t trust those propellers to keep spinning – so high up in the air. So I take boats whenever I go overseas. And the SS United States is the fastest ocean liner on the waters. No stops.” “Hmmm,” Langford commented. “This is 1957, Mr. Loftkiss,” Saunders stated. “Air safety has improved considerably since your country’s barnstorming days.” “Maybe. But I don’t take any chances. So, can I-” The two policemen moved on to Holding Cell 2. Sitting on a wobbly wooden chair at a worn wooden table was Cliff Snelling, artist, so he claimed. The resemblance between him and the Flying Bandit, as with Loftkiss, was strong. Langford contemplatively tapped his pipe, and said, “Paint me a picture, Mr. Snelling. Why were you attempting to board a ferry at Holyhead, bound for Dublin, Ireland? Perhaps trying to retrace your original flight path after the robbery?” “What? What ‘flight path’!” Snelling exploded, exhibiting a highly volatile artistic temperament, if nothing else. “I’ve been commissioned to paint some horses at Lord Harding’s Irish estate,” the agitated man added. “That’s why I was taking the ferry to Dublin. Please, I-” “And to think I always thought horses came with their own natural coloring,” Langford deadpanned to his assistant. The two men moved on to Holding Cell 3. Wherein, a Mr. Tom Jenks presided over a stony-faced silence, his arms folded across his chest. “You were picked up at Heathrow Airport,” the Chief Inspector stated, drawing upon his cold pipe as he did so the facts. “What was your exact intended destination, sir?” “Blow it out your briar, bobby!” Jenks retorted. “I’m suing you blokes for false arrest and imprisonment. This is how you treat American tourists – after we won the war for you!” “Yes, well, we’re all very grateful for that, I’m sure,” Langford puffed. “The airline says he was bound for Gander, Newfoundland, sir,” Sergeant Saunders informed his superior. “More tourism,” Jenks said. “I thought I’d see some of Canada on my way back to New York, that’s all. Now, you flatfoots had better-” The two policemen exchanged glances, and then moved on to Holding Cell 4. Occupying this barren, yellow-walled room was Clem Duster. “As I told the coppers who picked me up at the airfield, I was just renting a plane to do some pleasure-flying while I was in Manchester. I was a pilot in the Army Air Force during the war, see, and-” “Those ‘coppers’,” Langford interrupted, “found a flight plan to Iceland in that rented plane of yours, Mr. Duster. Iceland seems a tad far for a ‘pleasure flight’, doesn’t it?” “Okay, okay!” the man conceded. “Don’t tell my wife, but I met this dame, Miss Iceland, at a beauty pageant in New York a few weeks ago, and she told me about all these great hot springs they have in her home country. So, with my skin condition and all, I figured …” The two policemen left the cell and returned to Langford’s office. The Chief Inspector’s pipe was cold, but not the trail to nabbing the Flying Bandit. “Well, I’d say we’ve got our chap, wouldn’t you, Saunders?” The Sergeant nodded, his ginger mustache bristling upwards into a smile. “Shall I go get him out of the holding cell and bring him in here to be formally charged?” Langford knocked his pipe against the globe on his desk over the general area where the stolen money had been dropped. “Quite. And by the least circuitous route possible, if you don’t mind,” he added, his sky-blue eyes twinkling.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Where must the Flying Bandit go first?  \n   • He dropped the knapsack 5 hours into a 15-hour, 3 000-mile flight.  \n   • At 200 mph he was about 1 000 miles from Long Island – i.e. in the neighbourhood of Newfoundland/Gander, the first “stepping-stone” on any great-circle route from New York to Britain.  \n   • Whoever is the bandit therefore has only one real objective: reach Newfoundland before anyone else.\n\n2.  What is the safest way for the bandit to reach Newfoundland?  \n   • Every big British airport and seaport is on alert.  \n   • Taking a scheduled London–Gander flight (Jenks) or an ocean liner to New York (Loftkiss) means passing through heavily watched exit points and arriving amid American/Canadian police.  \n   • A much safer plan is the old wartime “stepping-stone” ferry route for light aircraft: Britain  →  Iceland  →  Greenland  →  Newfoundland.  \n     – Small charter fields are not being watched as closely.  \n     – The flight can be made in stages in a single-engine plane, the very sort of aircraft he flew in the first place.\n\n3.  Which suspect’s actions match that plan and show pilot capability?  \n   • David Loftkiss – claims to be afraid of flying and is boarding a liner. (No pilot skills, wrong destination.)  \n   • Cliff Snelling – taking only a ferry to Dublin. (No indication of flight ability, wrong direction.)  \n   • Tom Jenks – holds an airline ticket straight to Gander. (Right destination, but no indication he can fly a plane; moreover the bandit would avoid the most obvious, most-watched route.)  \n   • Clem Duster – ex-US Army Air Force pilot, caught in Manchester in a rented light plane whose filed flight plan is … Iceland. (Exactly the first hop of the stepping-stone route; he has both the skill and the unobtrusive, circuitous route the bandit would favour.)\n\n4.  Additional textual clues  \n   • Inspector Langford taps the globe where the money was dropped (Newfoundland) and then tells Saunders to fetch the culprit “by the least circuitous route possible” – a wry jab at the suspect who had just chosen the most circuitous route (Britain → Iceland → Newfoundland).  \n   • Only Duster needed an elaborate story (“Miss Iceland” and a “skin condition”) to justify that peculiar flight plan.\n\nTherefore the logical deduction singles out Clem Duster.\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDavid Loftkiss, Cliff Snelling, Tom Jenks, Clem Duster\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nClem Duster\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• 19 May 1957 – “The Flying Bandit” robs the Chase Manhattan Bank, stuffs US $200 000 into a knapsack, takes off alone from a Long Island strip in a small plane, and heads for England at about 200 mph.\n\n• Five hours out, roughly 1 000 miles from New York (over Newfoundland), he shows off to police on the radio, dangles the bag and accidentally drops it.  He screams, then continues to Liverpool, where a rough landing breaks both wheels.  He abandons the aircraft and disappears into Britain.\n\n• Knowing every ordinary exit is now watched, he waits until the fuss dies down, then rents another light aircraft at a quiet Manchester field.  He files a flight plan to Reykjavík, Iceland – the classic first hop of the wartime ferry route which will let him proceed on to Greenland and finally Newfoundland, right over the spot where the money fell.\n\n• Before he can take off, Scotland Yard, tipped off to watch for just such circuit-beating departures, arrests him.  The other three Americans, although superficially resembling the composite sketch, are innocent travellers unlucky enough to be leaving the country at the wrong time.\n\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• David Loftkiss:  Truly a jeweller; his irrational fear of flying fits his choice of the Southampton–New York liner.  A man terrified of air travel did not just fly the Atlantic solo the week before, nor would he choose the slowest possible way to reach the Newfoundland search area first.\n\n• Cliff Snelling:  Has no pilot background and was headed only for Dublin to fulfil an art commission.  Ireland lies well beyond the money-drop point and offers no practical way to comb Newfoundland quickly.\n\n• Tom Jenks:  Merely a brash tourist with an airline ticket straight to Gander.  Although the destination matches the drop zone, the commercial flight is the very route the real bandit would avoid.  Nothing ties Jenks to aviation skills or to the rented aircraft used in the robbery.\n\n• Only Clem Duster possesses:  \n   – proven flying experience (ex-Army Air Force),  \n   – a private aircraft at his disposal,  \n   – a filed route that is the classic “back-door” path to Newfoundland, and  \n   – a hastily concocted, implausible story to explain it.  All evidence converges on him as the Flying Bandit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

    "reveal_text": "The Flying Bandit inadvertently dropped the knapsack full of stolen cash out of his plane five hours and one thousand miles into his getaway flight from Long Island to Liverpool. Which would’ve put his plane over Newfoundland, Canada at the time, as the shortest air route from the northern US to England, due to the curvature of the earth, travels over Newfoundland. Just as Charles Lindbergh’s flight path did back in 1927, when he became the first man to fly solo from America to Europe.\nLooking at a map can be deceiving, as it shows the world as flat. But using a globe, and then tracing the shortest distance between New York and England, will mean passing through Newfoundland. The Great Circle Route, as it’s called. Therefore, Tom Jenks is the Flying Bandit, as he’s the only one of the four suspects trying to get directly back to Newfoundland, to attempt to retrieve his lost loot.",

Sergeant Saunders scooped it up, listened for a moment, said, “Right-o!”, and then pronged the receiver. “They’ve rounded up four men trying to leave the country who match the Flying Bandit’s general description, sir. They’re in the holding cells right now, waiting to be questioned.” Chief Inspector Langford smiled, tapping his teeth with his black pipe stem. “Good. We’re fortunate the man’s aircraft broke both wheels upon landing, or he’d certainly have used that bird to fly the coop undetected from our shores. His bad luck, again.” The man in Holding Cell 1 at Scotland Yard was David Loftkiss, a jeweler by profession, so he claimed, in the United Kingdom on business. “Mr. Loftkiss was stopped by the Southampton constabulary trying to board the SS United States bound for New York City,” Saunders summarized the report he’d received. “I have urgent business in New York!” Loftkiss exclaimed, rising out of his chair. “Why are you holding me up?” Langford calmly compared the man’s face to the police sketch the Yard had received of the Flying Bandit, based on the bank president’s description. “Indeed. Urgent business, you say? Why not take a plane, then, Mr. Loftkiss? Why take an ocean liner?” The man sat back down, his face pale. “I-I’m afraid of flying. I don’t trust those propellers to keep spinning – so high up in the air. So I take boats whenever I go overseas. And the SS United States is the fastest ocean liner on the waters. No stops.” “Hmmm,” Langford commented. “This is 1957, Mr. Loftkiss,” Saunders stated. “Air safety has improved considerably since your country’s barnstorming days.” “Maybe. But I don’t take any chances. So, can I-” The two policemen moved on to Holding Cell 2. Sitting on a wobbly wooden chair at a worn wooden table was Cliff Snelling, artist, so he claimed. The resemblance between him and the Flying Bandit, as with Loftkiss, was strong. Langford contemplatively tapped his pipe, and said, “Paint me a picture, Mr. Snelling. Why were you attempting to board a ferry at Holyhead, bound for Dublin, Ireland? Perhaps trying to retrace your original flight path after the robbery?” “What? What ‘flight path’!” Snelling exploded, exhibiting a highly volatile artistic temperament, if nothing else. “I’ve been commissioned to paint some horses at Lord Harding’s Irish estate,” the agitated man added. “That’s why I was taking the ferry to Dublin. Please, I-” “And to think I always thought horses came with their own natural coloring,” Langford deadpanned to his assistant. The two men moved on to Holding Cell 3. Wherein, a Mr. Tom Jenks presided over a stony-faced silence, his arms folded across his chest. “You were picked up at Heathrow Airport,” the Chief Inspector stated, drawing upon his cold pipe as he did so the facts. “What was your exact intended destination, sir?” “Blow it out your briar, bobby!” Jenks retorted. “I’m suing you blokes for false arrest and imprisonment. This is how you treat American tourists – after we won the war for you!” “Yes, well, we’re all very grateful for that, I’m sure,” Langford puffed. “The airline says he was bound for Gander, Newfoundland, sir,” Sergeant Saunders informed his superior. “More tourism,” Jenks said. “I thought I’d see some of Canada on my way back to New York, that’s all. Now, you flatfoots had better-” The two policemen exchanged glances, and then moved on to Holding Cell 4. Occupying this barren, yellow-walled room was Clem Duster. “As I told the coppers who picked me up at the airfield, I was just renting a plane to do some pleasure-flying while I was in Manchester. I was a pilot in the Army Air Force during the war, see, and-” “Those ‘coppers’,” Langford interrupted, “found a flight plan to Iceland in that rented plane of yours, Mr. Duster. Iceland seems a tad far for a ‘pleasure flight’, doesn’t it?” “Okay, okay!” the man conceded. “Don’t tell my wife, but I met this dame, Miss Iceland, at a beauty pageant in New York a few weeks ago, and she told me about all these great hot springs they have in her home country. So, with my skin condition and all, I figured …” The two policemen left the cell and returned to Langford’s office. The Chief Inspector’s pipe was cold, but not the trail to nabbing the Flying Bandit. “Well, I’d say we’ve got our chap, wouldn’t you, Saunders?” The Sergeant nodded, his ginger mustache bristling upwards into a smile. “Shall I go get him out of the holding cell and bring him in here to be formally charged?” Langford knocked his pipe against the globe on his desk over the general area where the stolen money had been dropped. “Quite. And by the least circuitous route possible, if you don’t mind,” he added, his sky-blue eyes twinkling.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Clem Duster; (b) Cliff Snelling; (c) David Loftkiss; (d) Tom Jenks",
      "answer": "(d) Tom Jenks",
      "outcome": "The Flying Bandit inadvertently dropped the knapsack full of stolen cash out of his plane five hours and one thousand miles into his getaway flight from Long Island to Liverpool. Which would’ve put his plane over Newfoundland, Canada at the time, as the shortest air route from the northern US to England, due to the curvature of the earth, travels over Newfoundland. Just as Charles Lindbergh’s flight path did back in 1927, when he became the first man to fly solo from America to Europe.\nLooking at a map can be deceiving, as it shows the world as flat. But using a globe, and then tracing the shortest distance between New York and England, will mean passing through Newfoundland. The Great Circle Route, as it’s called. Therefore, Tom Jenks is the Flying Bandit, as he’s the only one of the four suspects trying to get directly back to Newfoundland, to attempt to retrieve his lost loot."
