    "full_text": "I was sleeping the little sleep – napping – when a tall, blonde ankled into my office. “Well, my lunch was stolen again today!” he bleated, planting his slender hands on his slender hips, staring petulantly down at me. “Second time this week!” I pawed sand out of my eyes, cursing the casual office attire policy that allowed men to wear shorts at work. “What’d ya want me to do about it?” I gritted, shuffling some blank papers around on my desk like I was busy. Andreas Scolari, our one-man accounts payable department, huffed, “I expect you to find out who the thief is. You are the office manager, aren’t you?” I didn’t like people telling me my job (after all, it was spelled out in big black letters on my door). “Yeah, Skip Trace, office manager,” I growled, “that’s me. Don’t sweat it, Andreas, I’ll track down the chowhound who put the bite on your lunch.” At least I’d have something to sink my teeth into for the rest of the day. After getting the details on his missing food, I gave Andreas a five-dollar chit out of petty cash, good for a crust of bread and a glass of water down at the soup kitchen two blocks over. Then I put my dogs into motion, cornering Beryl Hives at her reception desk out front. Beryl was 63 going on 200. She had a smoky voice and a smoky pair of eyes -- courtesy of way too many cigarettes. She had a chip on her shoulder the size of her beehive hairdo. But she knew the goings-on in our small business office like nobody else. “Who’s been in the office this morning, Beryl?” I jawed, leaning up against her elevated countertop. I knew that Andreas Scolari had gotten into work at 9:00 a.m., and that his lunch break start-time had been 1:00 p.m. So his brown bagger must’ve been lifted from the company breakroom fridge sometime between those two times. An egg salad sandwich, an apple, an orange and a milk chocolate bar. “Pete, Dawn, Andreas, and Konrad,” Beryl rasped in reply to my question. “And you. Why?” “Andreas lost his lunch again today,” I yammered. She hacked out a laugh, phlegmy-like. “At least I won’t have to listen to him chomping on those apples of his, then. You can hear him crunching away in the lunchroom all the way up here!” “Yeah, life’s tough,” I agreed, sweet-talking the old lady. “But you know what they say, an apple a day-” I choked on my quote when I saw Beryl stick two of her nicotine-stained fingers into her mouth to rattle her falsies around. “Dentures can’t take ‘em – too hard,” she informed me. I barely kept my lunch down. And I hadn’t even eaten yet. “When’d you chow down?” I wheezed. “I had a half a pack of Camels outside at my usual time – noon to 1:00.” Armed with the list of names Beryl had provided, I trundled away from the reception area and down the hall, crowded up behind Pete Stampkowski at the snack machine. The plus-sized salesman was overindulging one of his many weaknesses again – junk food. “Had lunch yet, big guy?” I mouthed. He yanked the sisters Sweet Marie and Baby Ruth out of the bottom of the machine and straightened up with an ‘oof’. A grin split his heavy jowls. “Hey, Skip! Lunch? Yeah, sure, just got back – wining and dining Larry Kolger of LK Industries. We went to the Weiner Hut on Broadway. You been there lately? They got a-” “What time did you inhale the foot-longs and fries?” I interrupted, fingering the fresh mustard and gravy stains on the guy’s shirt. The last time Pete Stampkowski had eaten anything healthy was the time he’d scarfed down a bagful of Styrofoam packing worms, thinking they were white-cheese doodles. “Oh, we were there from around 11:45 ‘til now, I guess. I just got back. Say, you wanna hear something funny-” I left Pete to swallow his longwinded story, slipping past him and through the side door, out into the sunshine. I spotted Dawn de Jong stretching her legs, and I briefly shadowed her. Then flat-out ran to catch up with the well-toned payroll clerk striding down the sidewalk pumping her arms and legs. “Another walking lunch, sugar?” I puffed. “You know I never eat lunch, Skip,” she said, barely breathing hard. “I have all the fruits and nuts and water I need at my desk at work.” She turned her head and shone her violet eyes on me, smiling. I went weak in the knees. The shin splints I got all on my own. “How ‘bout making with the milk of human kindness and going out with me some time?” I gasped. She quickened her pace, leaving me in the dust. “Sorry,” she tossed over her shoulder, “but I’m lactose intolerant.” I collected my thoughts, and breath, and shouldered my way back into the office. I set up shop in the conference room, picked up the phone, punched up Konrad Pushkin’s cubicle. “Konrad, it’s your wife!” I warbled in my best falsetto. Imitations were one of my specialties, and I’d met Konrad’s distinctively high-pitched wife at last year’s Christmas party. “Yeah?” came the exasperated reply. Konrad was the company’s accounts receivable collector, a dour, hard-faced man with an attitude as stony as the Kremlin. And with good reason – he had seven children at home, and a job that barely put enough food in everyone’s mouth. “I need you to stop at the market on your way home and pick up a few hundred items!” I shrilled. He grunted, “I already gave you the food money for the week. There ain’t anymore!” I set the trap. “Weeell … can’t you maybe take up a collection at work – of food? There must be some lying around in the-” The trap snapped back in my face, the sharp clicking sound of Konrad angrily cutting the line leaving me speechless. For all his flinty faults, the guy did have a reputation for honesty and integrity. I ambled back outside to mull things over. But the hot summer sun didn’t burn off the fog surrounding my brain. Until I wandered into the parking lot out back and leaned up against the dumpster, and my nose started twitching. That’s when I knew it was time to get dirty. Before this case ate me up. So, I followed my beak, right over the side and into the bungalow-sized garbage container. And after only a few minutes of smelly sifting, I found what I was searching for: A brown paper bag containing a collection of bread crusts, a shiny red apple, a fistful of orange peels and one very empty milk chocolate bar wrapper. Evidence! I climbed out of the dumpster with my haul and tumbled to the pavement. Triumphantly! Knowing that I’d have the food burglar regurgitating a confession in no time.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Fix the time window  \n   • Lunch placed in fridge after 9:00 a.m.  \n   • Andreas discovers it gone at 1:00 p.m.  \n   • Therefore the theft occurred ­between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.\n\n2. Check everybody’s whereabouts inside that window  \n   • Beryl Hives – at her desk until noon, then outside smoking from 12-1.  \n   • Pete Stampkowski – left the building about 11:45 and did not return until a little after 1.  \n   • Dawn de Jong – at her desk nibbling “fruits, nuts and water,” then out power-walking during the lunch hour.  \n   • Konrad Pushkin – in his cubicle all morning, chained to the phone.  \n   • Skip (narrator) – investigating, not relevant.  \n\n3. Examine the physical evidence in the dumpster  \n   • A brown paper bag that once held:  \n        – Egg-salad sandwich – only the crusts remain.  \n        – Shiny red apple – completely untouched.  \n        – Orange – only peels remain.  \n        – Milk-chocolate bar – empty wrapper.  \n   • Whoever ate the lunch could not (or would not) bite into an apple and apparently left the tough bread crusts.\n\n4. Match the evidence to the suspects  \n   • Beryl: dentures that “can’t take apples – too hard,” and anything with a tough crust would also be discarded. Soft food (egg-salad center, orange segments, chocolate) is exactly what she could handle.  \n   • Pete: voracious; would have eaten everything, apple included.  \n   • Dawn: health fanatic; would eat the apple and orange but not the chocolate or egg-salad on white bread.  \n   • Konrad: needs the food, so he would not throw away an untouched apple.  \n\n5. Motive clues  \n   • Beryl openly complains about Andreas’s loud apple-crunching: “At least I won’t have to listen to him chomping on those apples of his, then.”  \n   • No one else expresses the slightest irritation toward Andreas or his lunch.\n\n6. Opportunity + disposal  \n   • Beryl passes the dumpster every day on her way to and from her outdoor smoke break (12-1). Perfect time to pitch the evidence.  \n   • She had possession of the lunch before noon, ate it while outside, then dumped the remains.\n\n7. Logical conclusion  \n   • Only Beryl’s dental limitations, motive and movements align perfectly with the contents of the bag and with the timeframe.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBeryl Hives, Pete Stampkowski, Dawn de Jong, Konrad Pushkin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nBeryl Hives\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nSometime shortly before noon, receptionist Beryl Hives slipped away from her front counter, walked to the break-room refrigerator and lifted Andreas Scolari’s paper-bag lunch.  \nAt noon she went outside for her usual smoke break, taking the lunch with her. While standing near the back dumpster she ate only the items her dentures could manage: the soft egg-salad inside the bread, the orange (discarding the peels) and the milk-chocolate bar. The bread crusts were too rubbery and the apple too hard, so she tossed them back into the bag.  \nBefore re-entering the building at 1 p.m. she dropped the incriminating bag into the dumpster and returned to her desk, secure in the thought that Andreas’s irritating apple-crunching would not disturb her that afternoon.  \nSkip Trace later followed the smell of cigarette smoke around the dumpster, found the bag, and put the pieces together.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nPete Stampkowski – Left the office at 11:45 for a client lunch and came back after 1 p.m., a period that overlaps Andreas’s discovery of the theft; moreover Pete would never leave an apple uneaten.  \nDawn de Jong – Eats only health-food staples she keeps at her desk and never eats lunch; a chocolate bar and egg-salad sandwich contradict her dietary habits, and she too would have taken the apple.  \nKonrad Pushkin – Though he needs food for his large family, his reputation for honesty is solid. More importantly, someone stealing out of need would not toss away perfectly good fruit.  \nThus Beryl Hives is the lone thief.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

They got a-” “What time did you inhale the foot-longs and fries?” I interrupted, fingering the fresh mustard and gravy stains on the guy’s shirt. The last time Pete Stampkowski had eaten anything healthy was the time he’d scarfed down a bagful of Styrofoam packing worms, thinking they were white-cheese doodles. “Oh, we were there from around 11:45 ‘til now, I guess. I just got back. Say, you wanna hear something funny-” I left Pete to swallow his longwinded story, slipping past him and through the side door, out into the sunshine. I spotted Dawn de Jong stretching her legs, and I briefly shadowed her. Then flat-out ran to catch up with the well-toned payroll clerk striding down the sidewalk pumping her arms and legs. “Another walking lunch, sugar?” I puffed. “You know I never eat lunch, Skip,” she said, barely breathing hard. “I have all the fruits and nuts and water I need at my desk at work.” She turned her head and shone her violet eyes on me, smiling. I went weak in the knees. The shin splints I got all on my own. “How ‘bout making with the milk of human kindness and going out with me some time?” I gasped. She quickened her pace, leaving me in the dust. “Sorry,” she tossed over her shoulder, “but I’m lactose intolerant.” I collected my thoughts, and breath, and shouldered my way back into the office. I set up shop in the conference room, picked up the phone, punched up Konrad Pushkin’s cubicle. “Konrad, it’s your wife!” I warbled in my best falsetto. Imitations were one of my specialties, and I’d met Konrad’s distinctively high-pitched wife at last year’s Christmas party. “Yeah?” came the exasperated reply. Konrad was the company’s accounts receivable collector, a dour, hard-faced man with an attitude as stony as the Kremlin. And with good reason – he had seven children at home, and a job that barely put enough food in everyone’s mouth. “I need you to stop at the market on your way home and pick up a few hundred items!” I shrilled. He grunted, “I already gave you the food money for the week. There ain’t anymore!” I set the trap. “Weeell … can’t you maybe take up a collection at work – of food? There must be some lying around in the-” The trap snapped back in my face, the sharp clicking sound of Konrad angrily cutting the line leaving me speechless. For all his flinty faults, the guy did have a reputation for honesty and integrity. I ambled back outside to mull things over. But the hot summer sun didn’t burn off the fog surrounding my brain. Until I wandered into the parking lot out back and leaned up against the dumpster, and my nose started twitching. That’s when I knew it was time to get dirty. Before this case ate me up. So, I followed my beak, right over the side and into the bungalow-sized garbage container. And after only a few minutes of smelly sifting, I found what I was searching for: A brown paper bag containing a collection of bread crusts, a shiny red apple, a fistful of orange peels and one very empty milk chocolate bar wrapper. Evidence! I climbed out of the dumpster with my haul and tumbled to the pavement. Triumphantly! Knowing that I’d have the food burglar regurgitating a confession in no time.",

      "outcome": "I strode back into the office and dumped the contents of the crumpled lunch sack on Andreas’ desktop. “Recognize these remains?” I jibbered.\nHe wrinkled his nose and pushed his chair away. “Yes, it looks like what’s left of my … lunch.”\n“Exactly!” I snarled. “With everything eaten down to the core except for this apple!” I picked up the crunchy fruit.\nAndreas stared at me. “So?”\n“So, there’re two people in this office who have apples on their natural enemies list – Pete Stampkowski and Beryl Hives.” I scooped up the orange peels, let them flutter back down to the desk. “And Pete wouldn’t eat an orange unless it was the chocolate kind you whack on a table to open. Not to mention, he was dining out with a client today.”\n“Why, that old-”\n“Easy, kid,” I cautioned. “Let me digest the rest of this case. I’ll get Beryl to cough you up an apology.”"
