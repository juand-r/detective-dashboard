    "full_text": "It was the mystery of the year. Or rather, it would have been -- if old James Cartright had the sense to die on a slow news day. But he passed away on Christmas Day, and our local feel-good newspaper had already planned enough cute kid and Santa stories to shove old Miser Cartright’s death onto page four. He wouldn’t have liked that. What he liked was running the town. Some say, ruining it. Remember the movie, “It’s A Wonderful Life” -- well, this town is what Bedford Falls would have been like if Miser Potter had run it. Local wits even said “Old Miser Cartright has been murdering Christmas for years -- serves him right to get murdered then!” I draw the line at that. A murder is a murder. But was it murder – or suicide? We weren’t making much progress, the chief and me, in solving it. Even old Miser Cartright deserved better than that! So we sat in the chief’s office, and reviewed what we had (which wasn’t much). He had died from an overdose of his heart medicine. We found out that his eyesight was bad, and that he had been given a new prescription. He had taken three times what Dr. Gilchrest had prescribed. He had a housekeeper, Moira Laurie, who’d been with him for years. She was visiting kinfolk on the other side of the county Christmas Day, when the body was discovered. I bet you’re wondering: Why did we think it was murder? Call it a sixth sense. But we weren’t sure. Again, something just didn’t sit right about the case. And aside from his heart pills, Miser Cartright wasn’t in bad shape. He would never have made the Senior Olympics, but he took care of himself pretty well, and everyone around here thought that his meanness would keep him going for years to come. Since we were treating it as a murder case, we got to see an advance look at his will. His money had been left to a remote cousin, Shannon Cartright, whom nobody knew. She wasn’t from around here. More surprising was the fact that he cut his son off without a cent. The chief was increasingly desperate. We had been over the Cartright Mansion again and again. Perhaps it was time to call it quits? I told him about the only thing I hadn’t checked was Cartright’s computer. The chief was startled that Cartright had a computer at all. That was unusual, and what was unusual sometimes furnished clues, in his experience. I went back to the Cartright Mansion, went into the study, and got right on it. It helped focus my attention that Miser Cartright had died sitting in that leather chair facing the computer. We had his online address from the numerous emails that he sent the local paper. His writing style was distinctive and selfish. If I could crack his password, perhaps I could find something. Hours went by. Then something occurred to me. Could it really be possible that the old goat had a sense of humor? I typed in “BedfordFalls,” and was in! I didn’t find much. Just copies of his emails and occasional letters back from the newspapers. But there was one interesting entry, titled “Holiday Letter.” I punched in Document Properties, and saw that he had worked on it for several hours, over the space of six different revisions. I wondered if someone more computer-savvy could punch up the changes that were made with each revision. I certainly couldn’t. But I was fascinated by what I read. The holiday letter was addressed to his son. I can’t do better than give you the actual letter that Miser Cartright wrote, so here it is: Dear Jonathan: I know we haven’t seen eye to eye for many years, but I think it’s time to let bygones be bygones. It is the Christmas season, after all. And they keep playing that old movie, “It’s A Wonderful Life.” Well, I’ve got to admit, it has had an effect on this old sinner. I’ve changed my will. I had the idea when I called my cousin, Shannon, and found that she had passed on six months ago. So much for keeping in touch! Since I had left everything to her, that makes the old will obsolete anyway. Time for a new one. Besides, changing the will got me to thinking: Why should I wait until I die to give things away? I’m donating money to our hospital, so that finally it will be an up-to-date facility that the town can use with pride. I’m tired of our smart and promising young people going somewhere else because they say there aren’t any opportunities here. Maybe more will stay now. I’ve talked with Dr. Gilchrest, and he is delighted to get started on this project right away! Do you really think they will call it the James Cartright Hospital? But, back to the will. You will now be getting the house and a trust fund to keep it up. I know your opinion of this place. Go ahead and sell it if you want, but if you do sell it, make sure that you provide for Moira, my housekeeper. How she put up with me for all these years is beyond me. I’ve just given her a few days off, so that she can go visit those relatives she is always talking about. I wish you well and regret our years of silence. For the first time, I feel ready to live a good life – a wonderful life! Your loving father, The letter was unsigned, and the last entry was made on Christmas Eve. “This certainly changes things,” the chief said.\n\t\n“Well, maybe. We’ve still got some questions to ask.” “Sure, go ahead. It’s your case now.” First, I talked with Jonathan Cartright. He was plainly uncomfortable, and feeling guilty about his father’s death. “No, he hadn’t told me about the change in his will, and I haven’t seen him in months. I had a call from Dr. Gilchrest, who told me about the new prescription, which was much stronger than his previous heart medicine. Maybe if I had stopped by, I could have helped with that prescription. I meant to. I would have, had I known that he had given Moira the time off -- she was always the one who got his prescription for him.” Moira was still devastated by the news. “It’s so nice of him to have made provision for me,” she said. “Now this town will finally realize what a fine man he was. Did I think the new wishes would be respected? I’m not a lawyer, but I do know this town. The probate judge, like everybody else, had been appointed by Cartright’s help, behind the scenes. I thought that there was a good chance that the new wishes would be respected. And I also thought the chief would be glad to bring a callous murderer to justice.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWho profits by James Cartright’s death?\n   •\tThe old (official) will gives everything to the remote cousin, Shannon.  \n     Shannon is already dead, so her estate – i.e. her husband, children or other heirs – would inherit.  \n     None of those heirs appear in the story and none were in town.  \n   •\tThe housekeeper Moira is left with nothing in the old will and only a small, uncertain bequest in the **new** will, so she would **lose** if James died before the new will was executed.  \n   •\tDr Gilchrest is counting on a very large living donation to his hospital project, something that disappears the moment Cartright dies. He therefore has every reason to keep the old man alive.  \n   •\tJonathan, the son, believes he is still completely cut out of the estate under the old will. If the old man stays alive long enough to change that will, Jonathan may lose all hope of ever inheriting. If his father dies at once, Jonathan may still contest the estate and at least force a settlement. Jonathan therefore has the strongest financial motive.\n\n2.\tWho had opportunity?\n   •\tThe mansion was practically empty.  Moira had been sent out of town.  \n   •\tDr Gilchrest saw James only in his office; there is no evidence he was at the mansion Christmas Eve or Christmas morning.  \n   •\tJonathan had no alibi and every pretext in the world to “drop by” – Christmas Eve is a natural time for an estranged son to visit his father.\n\n3.\tThe suspicious telephone call\n   Jonathan says: “I had a call from Dr Gilchrest, who told me about the new prescription, which was much stronger…”  \n   •\tThat is a blatant violation of medical-privacy law.  A conscientious doctor would never phone an estranged relative and discuss a patient’s medication without written permission.  \n   •\tIt is far more plausible that Jonathan learned about the new, much-stronger pills by seeing the prescription bottle himself when he visited the house.  His story is an awkward lie meant to explain knowledge he should not possess.\n\n4.\tThe manner of death\n   •\tJames did not swallow a handful of random drugs.  He took **exactly three pills** – three times the new dosage.  \n   •\tThe simplest way for a murderer to bring that about is to fill the old man’s pill-dispenser or bottle with the instruction “Take three tablets,” knowing the tablets are already triple strength.  \n   •\tSomeone with a medical background would have written a new prescription instead; someone who merely *saw* the label “Take one tablet” but understood the pills were far stronger would simply tell the victim “The doctor wants you to take three of these now.”  That fits an opportunistic visitor, not the physician.\n\n5.\tState of mind of the victim\n   The letter on the computer is full of hope and renewed purpose.  A man planning donations, family reconciliation and a “wonderful life” is plainly *not* planning suicide, so the overdose must be either accident or homicide.  The contrived triple-dose and the suspicious lie from Jonathan tip the balance to homicide.\n\n6.\tConclusion: motive, opportunity, knowledge of the new drug strength, and a clumsy lie all point to one and only one person – Jonathan Cartright.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJonathan Cartright, Moira Laurie, Dr. Samuel Gilchrest\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJonathan Cartright\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Christmas Eve afternoon:  Jonathan, believing he is still disinherited, drives to the mansion while Moira is away.  \n• He and his father talk; James, his eyesight poor, proudly shows the new prescription bottle. Jonathan realises the tablets are already three times as strong as the old medicine.  \n• Feigning concern, Jonathan volunteers to set out his father’s next doses and urges him to “take three right away – that’s what the new directions mean.”  He then leaves, satisfied that the lethal dose will look like James’s own doing.  \n• Christmas Eve night:  James works at his computer, finishing the conciliatory letter to his son, and obediently swallows the three pills Jonathan laid out.  \n• The massive overdose stops his heart; he dies in the study, still sitting at the computer.  \n• Christmas Day:  the body is discovered; the triple-strength prescription and empty glass make it appear that James simply mis-read the label.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Moira Laurie – She was out of town with relatives (easily verified), would have gained far more from James staying alive long enough to finalise the new will, and had always been provided for by him. No motive, solid alibi.  \n• Dr. Samuel Gilchrest – He personally stood to receive a multi-million-dollar hospital donation only if James remained alive. Killing his benefactor would destroy that dream and expose him to immediate suspicion; prescribing “too strong” a drug would have left a paper trail pointing straight at him. He had every incentive to keep James healthy.  \nOnly Jonathan had the motive, the access and the necessary knowledge – and he betrayed himself by inventing that impossible telephone call from the doctor.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

You will now be getting the house and a trust fund to keep it up. I know your opinion of this place. Go ahead and sell it if you want, but if you do sell it, make sure that you provide for Moira, my housekeeper. How she put up with me for all these years is beyond me. I’ve just given her a few days off, so that she can go visit those relatives she is always talking about. I wish you well and regret our years of silence. For the first time, I feel ready to live a good life – a wonderful life! Your loving father, The letter was unsigned, and the last entry was made on Christmas Eve. “This certainly changes things,” the chief said.\n\t\n“Well, maybe. We’ve still got some questions to ask.” “Sure, go ahead. It’s your case now.” First, I talked with Jonathan Cartright. He was plainly uncomfortable, and feeling guilty about his father’s death. “No, he hadn’t told me about the change in his will, and I haven’t seen him in months. I had a call from Dr. Gilchrest, who told me about the new prescription, which was much stronger than his previous heart medicine. Maybe if I had stopped by, I could have helped with that prescription. I meant to. I would have, had I known that he had given Moira the time off -- she was always the one who got his prescription for him.” Moira was still devastated by the news. “It’s so nice of him to have made provision for me,” she said. “Now this town will finally realize what a fine man he was. Did I think the new wishes would be respected? I’m not a lawyer, but I do know this town. The probate judge, like everybody else, had been appointed by Cartright’s help, behind the scenes. I thought that there was a good chance that the new wishes would be respected. And I also thought the chief would be glad to bring a callous murderer to justice.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Dr. Gilchrest; (b) Jonathan Cartright; (c) Miser James Cartright (suicide); (d) Moira Laurie",
      "answer": "(d) Moira Laurie",
      "outcome": "Jonathan Cartright had no opportunity to kill his father, although the new disposition of property favored him. He hadn’t even seen him recently, and although he did know about the change in his father’s prescription, he relied on Moira to give the pills properly.\nMiser James Cartright did not commit suicide, or take the new pills by accident. There is no evidence pointing to suicide. On the contrary, he seemed to finally feel upbeat about his life. And he did not set out his own prescriptions and glass of water. Given his bad eyesight, he depended on his housekeeper to do that.\nDr. Gilchrest did not murder his patient. He was delighted by the new hospital donation.\nOn the witness stand, Moira was asked why, if she was going away for a few days, no arrangement had been made for someone else to give Cartright his prescription pills during her holiday. She had no answer. But the prosecuting attorney did: Moira had given Cartright a fatal dose of his prescription before she left town. She knew no one would have to care for a dead man."
