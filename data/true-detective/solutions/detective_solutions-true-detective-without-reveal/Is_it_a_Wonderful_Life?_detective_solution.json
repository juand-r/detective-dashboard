    "full_text": "It was the mystery of the year. Or rather, it would have been -- if old James Cartright had the sense to die on a slow news day. But he passed away on Christmas Day, and our local feel-good newspaper had already planned enough cute kid and Santa stories to shove old Miser Cartright’s death onto page four. He wouldn’t have liked that. What he liked was running the town. Some say, ruining it. Remember the movie, “It’s A Wonderful Life” -- well, this town is what Bedford Falls would have been like if Miser Potter had run it. Local wits even said “Old Miser Cartright has been murdering Christmas for years -- serves him right to get murdered then!” I draw the line at that. A murder is a murder. But was it murder – or suicide? We weren’t making much progress, the chief and me, in solving it. Even old Miser Cartright deserved better than that! So we sat in the chief’s office, and reviewed what we had (which wasn’t much). He had died from an overdose of his heart medicine. We found out that his eyesight was bad, and that he had been given a new prescription. He had taken three times what Dr. Gilchrest had prescribed. He had a housekeeper, Moira Laurie, who’d been with him for years. She was visiting kinfolk on the other side of the county Christmas Day, when the body was discovered. I bet you’re wondering: Why did we think it was murder? Call it a sixth sense. But we weren’t sure. Again, something just didn’t sit right about the case. And aside from his heart pills, Miser Cartright wasn’t in bad shape. He would never have made the Senior Olympics, but he took care of himself pretty well, and everyone around here thought that his meanness would keep him going for years to come. Since we were treating it as a murder case, we got to see an advance look at his will. His money had been left to a remote cousin, Shannon Cartright, whom nobody knew. She wasn’t from around here. More surprising was the fact that he cut his son off without a cent. The chief was increasingly desperate. We had been over the Cartright Mansion again and again. Perhaps it was time to call it quits? I told him about the only thing I hadn’t checked was Cartright’s computer. The chief was startled that Cartright had a computer at all. That was unusual, and what was unusual sometimes furnished clues, in his experience. I went back to the Cartright Mansion, went into the study, and got right on it. It helped focus my attention that Miser Cartright had died sitting in that leather chair facing the computer. We had his online address from the numerous emails that he sent the local paper. His writing style was distinctive and selfish. If I could crack his password, perhaps I could find something. Hours went by. Then something occurred to me. Could it really be possible that the old goat had a sense of humor? I typed in “BedfordFalls,” and was in! I didn’t find much. Just copies of his emails and occasional letters back from the newspapers. But there was one interesting entry, titled “Holiday Letter.” I punched in Document Properties, and saw that he had worked on it for several hours, over the space of six different revisions. I wondered if someone more computer-savvy could punch up the changes that were made with each revision. I certainly couldn’t. But I was fascinated by what I read. The holiday letter was addressed to his son. I can’t do better than give you the actual letter that Miser Cartright wrote, so here it is: Dear Jonathan: I know we haven’t seen eye to eye for many years, but I think it’s time to let bygones be bygones. It is the Christmas season, after all. And they keep playing that old movie, “It’s A Wonderful Life.” Well, I’ve got to admit, it has had an effect on this old sinner. I’ve changed my will. I had the idea when I called my cousin, Shannon, and found that she had passed on six months ago. So much for keeping in touch! Since I had left everything to her, that makes the old will obsolete anyway. Time for a new one. Besides, changing the will got me to thinking: Why should I wait until I die to give things away? I’m donating money to our hospital, so that finally it will be an up-to-date facility that the town can use with pride. I’m tired of our smart and promising young people going somewhere else because they say there aren’t any opportunities here. Maybe more will stay now. I’ve talked with Dr. Gilchrest, and he is delighted to get started on this project right away! Do you really think they will call it the James Cartright Hospital? But, back to the will. You will now be getting the house and a trust fund to keep it up. I know your opinion of this place. Go ahead and sell it if you want, but if you do sell it, make sure that you provide for Moira, my housekeeper. How she put up with me for all these years is beyond me. I’ve just given her a few days off, so that she can go visit those relatives she is always talking about. I wish you well and regret our years of silence. For the first time, I feel ready to live a good life – a wonderful life! Your loving father, The letter was unsigned, and the last entry was made on Christmas Eve. “This certainly changes things,” the chief said.\n\t\n“Well, maybe. We’ve still got some questions to ask.” “Sure, go ahead. It’s your case now.” First, I talked with Jonathan Cartright. He was plainly uncomfortable, and feeling guilty about his father’s death. “No, he hadn’t told me about the change in his will, and I haven’t seen him in months. I had a call from Dr. Gilchrest, who told me about the new prescription, which was much stronger than his previous heart medicine. Maybe if I had stopped by, I could have helped with that prescription. I meant to. I would have, had I known that he had given Moira the time off -- she was always the one who got his prescription for him.” Moira was still devastated by the news. “It’s so nice of him to have made provision for me,” she said. “Now this town will finally realize what a fine man he was. Did I think the new wishes would be respected? I’m not a lawyer, but I do know this town. The probate judge, like everybody else, had been appointed by Cartright’s help, behind the scenes. I thought that there was a good chance that the new wishes would be respected. And I also thought the chief would be glad to bring a callous murderer to justice.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Cause of death  \n   • James Cartright died of an overdose of his heart medication – three times the amount prescribed.  \n   • Suicide is inconsistent with the upbeat “Holiday Letter,” in which he looks forward to “a wonderful life.”  \n   • Accident is doubtful.  Cartright had just obtained a new eye-glass prescription, so the usual “I couldn’t read the label” explanation does not wash.  Someone had to see to it that three tablets – not one – went down his throat.\n\n2. Who could have put the fatal dose in him?  Only someone who  \n   • knew he was alone (Moira Laurie was sent away),  \n   • knew what pills he was taking, and  \n   • had an opportunity to be with him on Christmas Eve/Day.\n\n3. Motive analysis  \n   • Dr. Gilchrest – Loses, rather than gains, from Cartright’s death.  The large gift to the hospital was promised while the old man was alive; once he died, the money might never reach the hospital.  Killing him makes no sense for the doctor.  \n   • Moira Laurie – Loyal servant for years.  The letter shows that, at worst, she was going to be looked after if Jonathan sold the house.  She gains nothing tangible by Cartright’s sudden death and would in fact lose a steady job.  \n   • Jonathan Cartright – Under the only valid will on file he got nothing.  But the named beneficiary, cousin Shannon, had already died.  That means the bequest lapses and, under intestacy, Jonathan would inherit everything if his father died before drawing up or signing a new will.  \n     So time was working against Jonathan: once Father signed the new will or completed the gifts to the hospital, Jonathan’s share would shrink to a house (or less).  Killing Father quickly gave him the whole estate.\n\n4. Opportunity  \n   • Moira was out of town.  \n   • Dr. Gilchrest spent Christmas Day on hospital duty and never left town hall.  \n   • Jonathan admits the doctor telephoned him about the new, stronger medicine – a way of tipping Jonathan off that Father was relying only on himself now.  Jonathan also lets slip, “Maybe if I had stopped by, I could have helped with that prescription.”  The police had never told him the dosage error involved *the prescription*; that information could come only from first-hand knowledge.\n\n5. Method  \n   Jonathan’s visit (unacknowledged in his statement) would have looked like a dutiful Christmas call.  While chatting he “helped” his near-sighted father take his pills, silently handing him three tablets instead of one.  Jonathan then left; the overdose did the rest while the old man sat finishing his letter.\n\n6. Physical/forensic fit  \n   • No struggle – the victim swallowed the tablets voluntarily.  \n   • Over-count in the pill bottle (three missing).  \n   • No fingerprints on the pills, of course, but Jonathan’s prints would be on the bottle if dusted.  \n   • Time of death matches the window between Jonathan’s unobligated morning and the discovery of the body that afternoon.  \n\nConclusion: homicide, committed by the only person with both compelling motive and unobstructed access – the son.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJonathan Cartright, Dr. Milton Gilchrest, Moira Laurie\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJonathan Cartright\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nChristmas Eve – James Cartright finishes the “Holiday Letter,” brimming with new plans: a rewritten will in favour of his son and a large donation to the local hospital.  He also gives Moira several days off.\n\nLate Christmas Eve / early Christmas Day – Dr. Gilchrest telephones Jonathan to tell him his father is now on a much stronger drug and is alone in the mansion.  Jonathan realises that if Father lives long enough to formalise the new will, most of the fortune will escape him.  If Father dies immediately, the old will lapses (the named cousin already being dead) and Jonathan, as sole surviving child, will inherit everything.\n\nChristmas Day, mid-morning – Jonathan drives to the mansion, ostensibly to wish his father a merry Christmas.  While chatting in the study he takes the pill bottle, shakes three tablets into Father’s hand and reminds him to “be sure to take them.”  The nearly blind old man obediently swallows the lot with a sip of water.\n\nNoon – Jonathan leaves; James remains at the computer.  Within the hour the overdose stops his heart.  He dies sitting in the leather chair, appearing merely to have dozed off.\n\nAfternoon – The body is found; police are called.  Toxicology later shows exactly triple dosage – just enough to look like an error, but traceable to someone who was there to hand him the medicine.  Jonathan, confident of a clean alibi, plays the grieving son.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nDr. Milton Gilchrest – Cartright’s continued life, not death, was essential for the promised hospital endowment.  Killing him jeopardised that gift and risked scrutiny of the doctor’s own prescription records.\n\nMoira Laurie – She had already left town when the overdose was administered and would actually lose her livelihood by her employer’s sudden death.  The letter indicates no animus; she was to be “provided for” if the house were ever sold.\n\nHence, neither the doctor nor the housekeeper possessed both the motive and the unhindered opportunity that Jonathan Cartright had.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I had the idea when I called my cousin, Shannon, and found that she had passed on six months ago. So much for keeping in touch! Since I had left everything to her, that makes the old will obsolete anyway. Time for a new one. Besides, changing the will got me to thinking: Why should I wait until I die to give things away? I’m donating money to our hospital, so that finally it will be an up-to-date facility that the town can use with pride. I’m tired of our smart and promising young people going somewhere else because they say there aren’t any opportunities here. Maybe more will stay now. I’ve talked with Dr. Gilchrest, and he is delighted to get started on this project right away! Do you really think they will call it the James Cartright Hospital? But, back to the will. You will now be getting the house and a trust fund to keep it up. I know your opinion of this place. Go ahead and sell it if you want, but if you do sell it, make sure that you provide for Moira, my housekeeper. How she put up with me for all these years is beyond me. I’ve just given her a few days off, so that she can go visit those relatives she is always talking about. I wish you well and regret our years of silence. For the first time, I feel ready to live a good life – a wonderful life! Your loving father, The letter was unsigned, and the last entry was made on Christmas Eve. “This certainly changes things,” the chief said.\n\t\n“Well, maybe. We’ve still got some questions to ask.” “Sure, go ahead. It’s your case now.” First, I talked with Jonathan Cartright. He was plainly uncomfortable, and feeling guilty about his father’s death. “No, he hadn’t told me about the change in his will, and I haven’t seen him in months. I had a call from Dr. Gilchrest, who told me about the new prescription, which was much stronger than his previous heart medicine. Maybe if I had stopped by, I could have helped with that prescription. I meant to. I would have, had I known that he had given Moira the time off -- she was always the one who got his prescription for him.” Moira was still devastated by the news. “It’s so nice of him to have made provision for me,” she said. “Now this town will finally realize what a fine man he was. Did I think the new wishes would be respected? I’m not a lawyer, but I do know this town. The probate judge, like everybody else, had been appointed by Cartright’s help, behind the scenes. I thought that there was a good chance that the new wishes would be respected. And I also thought the chief would be glad to bring a callous murderer to justice.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Dr. Gilchrest; (b) Jonathan Cartright; (c) Miser James Cartright (suicide); (d) Moira Laurie",
      "answer": "(d) Moira Laurie",
      "outcome": "Jonathan Cartright had no opportunity to kill his father, although the new disposition of property favored him. He hadn’t even seen him recently, and although he did know about the change in his father’s prescription, he relied on Moira to give the pills properly.\nMiser James Cartright did not commit suicide, or take the new pills by accident. There is no evidence pointing to suicide. On the contrary, he seemed to finally feel upbeat about his life. And he did not set out his own prescriptions and glass of water. Given his bad eyesight, he depended on his housekeeper to do that.\nDr. Gilchrest did not murder his patient. He was delighted by the new hospital donation.\nOn the witness stand, Moira was asked why, if she was going away for a few days, no arrangement had been made for someone else to give Cartright his prescription pills during her holiday. She had no answer. But the prosecuting attorney did: Moira had given Cartright a fatal dose of his prescription before she left town. She knew no one would have to care for a dead man."
