    "full_text": "“It’s hardly murder,” the inspector complained as he kicked at the shredded remains of the scarecrow. “Well that’s just the thing, Inspector Gregson,” Mr. Forbes said. “This is the fourth time it has happened. It will be murder next and it will be me that gets murdered. I am to be knifed in my bed before you think to investigate properly.” “There’s not much for me to investigate,” Gregson said. “Every day you put a scarecrow out on your estate and every night he gets viciously sabotaged.” “You admit it then!” The old man shrieked. “You admit it’s a sabotage!” “The damage was certainly done with a knife of some kind. The tears are not the ragged kind I’d expect to see if a wild animal had done this.” “Probably a gang.” “Mr. Forbes, please. If you can give me some facts then do so, but leave the theorizing to the official forces,” said Inspector Gregson. Mr. Forbes muttered something under his breath about the theories of the official forces. Inspector Gregson decided it was best to pretend he hadn’t heard. He wondered if the old man could have concocted this bizarre case himself in order to get some publicity for his business. Over in the courtyard, Gregson spotted the butler, a skinny but wiry man with an extremely sour expression on his face. “My superior told me you actually saw this supposed gang last night.” Gregson said, continuing his discussion with Forbes. “That’s right. I heard the sound of tearing cloth and looked out of my bedroom window.” “How many were there?” “Well, I couldn’t rightly say. My eyesight isn’t what it was, but I could make out some commotion in the vicinity of the scarecrow. Whoever it was certainly made a brutal attack. The scarecrow came apart as though it were made of paper, destroyed completely in seconds by the ferocious attack.” The attack had certainly been ferocious, the inspector mused. Not only had the scarecrow's clothes been cut up, but the stick propping it up had been cut clean through. “It was then that I phoned the police,” Mr. Forbes said, dramatically. According to his superior, Mr. Forbes had called the police the previous night to report another attack in progress. Gregson had volunteered for the job. The idea of a psychopath incensed at scarecrows to the point of manically ripping them to shreds had been rather appealing to him, at least compared with spending Friday afternoon filling out dreary paperwork. The more time he spent with Mr. Forbes, however, the more he regretted not being back at the station. “Why not just stop putting a scarecrow out?” Gregson asked. “What?! Let them win? I have a business to run here. People come to look around the house. My grandfather was a great explorer and we have some of his things here for visitors to see. There is an amusing idea that he hid treasure somewhere on the grounds. Besides, if I stop putting out a scarecrow, what’s to say it won’t provoke whoever is doing this? What’s to say they won’t come after me that very night?” “All right, all right,” the inspector said wearily, as he raised his hands to stop the tirade. “I’d like to speak to the other people in your household: the cook, the maid and the butler.” The maid, Annie, was a shy girl of twenty who was working at the house for the summer. She gave Gregson the impression that she wasn’t much relishing her job and was outspoken in her dislike of Mr. Forbes. Gregson wondered if Annie would take such extreme measures to frighten her boss. When Gregson questioned her, she told him that she had been too frightened to sleep the previous night. She had tried to calm her nerves by pacing her room and had occasionally glanced out the window towards the figure of the scarecrow. “I felt ever so sorry for him, sir, the poor scarecrow all alone out there in the night. And then the slasher came.” ‘You saw someone!’ The inspector exclaimed. “Not clearly, but I saw a single figure cross the field from the house. The person prowled along, very agile, like a cat, and darted from one shrubbery and potted plant to another, as if trying to stay hidden. When the figure got up to the scarecrow, he – or she, I suppose – seemed to attack it. Then I saw the gleam of a knife, shining silver in the moonlight. It was dreadful.” “Do you recall the time when you saw the slasher?” “Yes, I had looked at the clock just before I looked out the window. It was twenty minutes past eleven.” This matched exactly the time that his superior had said Mr. Forbes had called in the crime. Gregson went to the ground floor to interview the cook, a woman named Mrs. Avery. She met him as he was approaching the kitchens. She had a bad limp that seemed to encumber her movement to a great extent. To the inspector’s surprise, Mrs. Avery produced a large set of keys from her pocket and unlocked the door. “You lock the house kitchen?” Gregson asked. “I have to, sir. The butler has taken it into his head to help himself to provisions and I can’t baby-sit him as well as run this house. I can barely keep up with the work. The maid is too flighty and feeble to even help me with the washing let alone any of the heavy work. The butler seems more interested in loitering in here, probably trying to pinch food, than doing any real work. I even have to make up the scarecrow, only to have it ripped to shreds every night. As if I don’t have enough to do already.” “Philips doesn't look like a man with a large appetite,” the inspector said, laughing. “Perhaps he is developing one.” “Developing, Mrs. Avery? How long have you had to lock him out like this?” “Four days, sir. I remember exactly because he started up this silly behaviour when I sorted out the attic for old clothes to put on that wretched scarecrow. You can see the spare ones over there in the corner.” The inspector nodded. “Thank you, Mrs. Avery. That will be all. Please tell Mr. Philips I wish to see him now.” Mrs. Avery left while Inspector Gregson squatted down and rooted through the spare clothes. After a few moments, he drew his hand out from the pile and wrapped around his fingers was a beautiful, glittering necklace.” “Why do you need to see me?” The butler snapped from the doorway. “I was hoping that you could answer some questions for me,” Gregson said. “Have you seen or heard anything relating to these scarecrow slashings that could shed some light on the matter?” “Seen nothing, heard nothing,” came the curt reply. “Where were you last night between eleven o'clock and midnight?” The inspector asked. “Sleeping in my bed, like any decent person. Is that against the law?” “Not at all,” Gregson said. “And may I ask what has caused your recent increase in appetite? An appetite so intense, it seems, that Mrs. Avery felt it necessary to lock you out of the kitchen?” The butler's face became a scowl. “High and mighty Mrs. Avery. She locks the kitchen because she can. She has a petty position of power and enjoys lording it over me.” “Well, thank you for your co-operation,” the inspector said, dryly. “Perhaps it will interest you to know that I have reached my conclusion as to the identity of the scarecrow slasher.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What changed four nights ago?  \n   • Mrs Avery emptied the attic and began dressing the scarecrow with the old clothes she found there.  \n   • From that same day on Mr Philips, the butler, started “hanging round the kitchen” and the nightly slashings began.  \n   ⇒ Whatever was inside those attic-clothes suddenly became worth searching for.\n\n2. What hidden object do the clothes contain?  \n   • Gregson finds a valuable necklace stuffed in the heap of spare garments.  \n   • The grandfather-treasure legend therefore has some truth: jewels are actually sewn or hidden in the old clothes.\n\n3. Who would realise this and have a reason to tear the scarecrows apart?  \n   • Someone who saw or handled those clothes and suspected treasure.  \n   • Mrs Avery already HAS the clothes in her locked kitchen – she can inspect them at leisure; she needs no night raid.  \n   • Annie the maid never touched the attic clothes (she calls them “poor scarecrow” and is frightened).  \n   • Mr Forbes is half-blind and elderly; the attacker Annie saw was “very agile … like a cat”.  \n   • Mr Philips was barred from the clothes (the kitchen is now locked).  To get at the garments actually on the scarecrow he must go outside at night – hence the slashings.\n\n4. Physical clues  \n   • The attacker is quick and furtive – description fits the “skinny but wiry” butler.  \n   • Stick supporting the scarecrow was cut clean through – needs a strong, sharp knife such as a servant might keep.  \n   • Mrs Avery’s bad limp rules her out; Forbes could not move so fast.  \n   • Philips has no alibi – only his own word that he was asleep.\n\n5. Why the kitchen “food-thefts”?  \n   • Mrs Avery thinks Philips wants provisions, but Gregson realises Philips was really trying to enter the kitchen to rummage through the pile of attic clothes before the cook could lock up.\n\n6. Therefore the only person with motive (finding the treasure), opportunity (free to roam at night), matching description (agile, wiry), and lacking an alibi is the butler, Mr Philips.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Edward Forbes, Annie (maid), Mrs. Martha Avery (cook), Mr. James Philips (butler)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMr. James Philips (the butler)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFour days ago Mrs Avery raided the attic for old garments to dress the estate’s scarecrow.  \nWhen Mr Philips helped carry the bundle downstairs he noticed something bulky sewn into a coat-lining and guessed that the late explorer’s long-rumoured treasure might be hidden in the clothes.  \nBefore he could examine them, Mrs Avery locked the kitchen each night, keeping the bundle – and the key – away from him.\n\nFrustrated, Philips decided to search the garments that were outside his employer’s protection: the ones already on the scarecrow.  \nEach night around 11 p.m. he slipped out of the house, crept across the grounds and savagely hacked the scarecrow apart, slitting every seam and even cutting through its support-pole to work faster.  \nHe rifled the straw stuffing for jewellery, then slunk back to bed.  \nMr Forbes, half-blind, heard the tearing sounds and telephoned the police, convinced “a gang” was vandalising his property; Annie saw the prowling figure but could not recognise him.  \nOn the fourth morning Inspector Gregson arrives, connects Philips’s sudden interest in the locked kitchen with the treasure rumour, finds an overlooked necklace in the pile of spare clothes, and deduces that the wiry, un-alibied butler is the nightly scarecrow slasher.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mr Forbes – elderly, poor eyesight, not agile enough to be the “cat-like” raider; moreover he phoned the police while the attack was taking place.  \n• Annie – only witness; no motive to hunt treasure she never handled; description she gave does not match her own timid behaviour.  \n• Mrs Avery – crippled by a pronounced limp, physically incapable of the swift dash across the field; she already possessed the attic clothes and could inspect them without theatrics, giving her no motive to dismember the scarecrow.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It will be murder next and it will be me that gets murdered. I am to be knifed in my bed before you think to investigate properly.” “There’s not much for me to investigate,” Gregson said. “Every day you put a scarecrow out on your estate and every night he gets viciously sabotaged.” “You admit it then!” The old man shrieked. “You admit it’s a sabotage!” “The damage was certainly done with a knife of some kind.

The idea of a psychopath incensed at scarecrows to the point of manically ripping them to shreds had been rather appealing to him, at least compared with spending Friday afternoon filling out dreary paperwork. The more time he spent with Mr. Forbes, however, the more he regretted not being back at the station. “Why not just stop putting a scarecrow out?” Gregson asked. “What?! Let them win? I have a business to run here. People come to look around the house. My grandfather was a great explorer and we have some of his things here for visitors to see. There is an amusing idea that he hid treasure somewhere on the grounds. Besides, if I stop putting out a scarecrow, what’s to say it won’t provoke whoever is doing this? What’s to say they won’t come after me that very night?” “All right, all right,” the inspector said wearily, as he raised his hands to stop the tirade. “I’d like to speak to the other people in your household: the cook, the maid and the butler.” The maid, Annie, was a shy girl of twenty who was working at the house for the summer. She gave Gregson the impression that she wasn’t much relishing her job and was outspoken in her dislike of Mr. Forbes. Gregson wondered if Annie would take such extreme measures to frighten her boss. When Gregson questioned her, she told him that she had been too frightened to sleep the previous night. She had tried to calm her nerves by pacing her room and had occasionally glanced out the window towards the figure of the scarecrow. “I felt ever so sorry for him, sir, the poor scarecrow all alone out there in the night. And then the slasher came.” ‘You saw someone!’ The inspector exclaimed. “Not clearly, but I saw a single figure cross the field from the house. The person prowled along, very agile, like a cat, and darted from one shrubbery and potted plant to another, as if trying to stay hidden. When the figure got up to the scarecrow, he – or she, I suppose – seemed to attack it. Then I saw the gleam of a knife, shining silver in the moonlight. It was dreadful.” “Do you recall the time when you saw the slasher?” “Yes, I had looked at the clock just before I looked out the window. It was twenty minutes past eleven.” This matched exactly the time that his superior had said Mr. Forbes had called in the crime. Gregson went to the ground floor to interview the cook, a woman named Mrs. Avery. She met him as he was approaching the kitchens. She had a bad limp that seemed to encumber her movement to a great extent. To the inspector’s surprise, Mrs. Avery produced a large set of keys from her pocket and unlocked the door. “You lock the house kitchen?” Gregson asked. “I have to, sir. The butler has taken it into his head to help himself to provisions and I can’t baby-sit him as well as run this house. I can barely keep up with the work. The maid is too flighty and feeble to even help me with the washing let alone any of the heavy work. The butler seems more interested in loitering in here, probably trying to pinch food, than doing any real work. I even have to make up the scarecrow, only to have it ripped to shreds every night. As if I don’t have enough to do already.” “Philips doesn't look like a man with a large appetite,” the inspector said, laughing. “Perhaps he is developing one.” “Developing, Mrs. Avery? How long have you had to lock him out like this?” “Four days, sir. I remember exactly because he started up this silly behaviour when I sorted out the attic for old clothes to put on that wretched scarecrow. You can see the spare ones over there in the corner.” The inspector nodded. “Thank you, Mrs. Avery. That will be all. Please tell Mr. Philips I wish to see him now.” Mrs. Avery left while Inspector Gregson squatted down and rooted through the spare clothes. After a few moments, he drew his hand out from the pile and wrapped around his fingers was a beautiful, glittering necklace.” “Why do you need to see me?” The butler snapped from the doorway. “I was hoping that you could answer some questions for me,” Gregson said. “Have you seen or heard anything relating to these scarecrow slashings that could shed some light on the matter?” “Seen nothing, heard nothing,” came the curt reply. “Where were you last night between eleven o'clock and midnight?” The inspector asked. “Sleeping in my bed, like any decent person. Is that against the law?” “Not at all,” Gregson said. “And may I ask what has caused your recent increase in appetite? An appetite so intense, it seems, that Mrs. Avery felt it necessary to lock you out of the kitchen?” The butler's face became a scowl. “High and mighty Mrs. Avery. She locks the kitchen because she can. She has a petty position of power and enjoys lording it over me.” “Well, thank you for your co-operation,” the inspector said, dryly. “Perhaps it will interest you to know that I have reached my conclusion as to the identity of the scarecrow slasher.”",

    "reveal_text": "“I knew it had to be someone in the house, since the figure of the slasher was seen to cross the field to the scarecrow from the direction of the house,” Gregson explained. “It couldn’t have been Mr. Forbes because he was on the phone with the police when the slasher was spotted by the maid. The maid also told me that the figure was very agile, which rules out the cook; with her bad leg her movement is cumbersome at best.”\n“Why believe everything Annie says?” The butler snapped. “She could have done it!”\n“No,” said Inspector Gregson. “Mrs. Avery told me that Annie can barely help with the household chores. If she cannot lug piles of sheets around, I doubt that she has the strength to hack scarecrows to pieces with a blade, and she certainly can’t cut wooden poles clean through.\n“It's also extraordinary that your sudden burst of appetite started the day of the first scarecrow incident. It’s quite clear to me, Philips, that you wanted to get the scarecrow’s clothes, or rather something in the clothes, since you destroyed them in the process of searching them.”\nGregson held up the sparkling necklace for Philips to see.\nPhilips wrung his hands together. “I’ve not harmed anyone,” he wailed. “It has often been suggested that the old master of the house concealed something of great value within these walls. Over the years I’ve searched for it and then all of a sudden Mrs. Avery found those old clothes to use for the scarecrow, I’d have looked through them in my own time but she locked me out of the kitchen. I knew that if I destroyed the scarecrows she’d have to make new ones and gradually I’d be able to search all the clothes.”\nPhilips hid his face behind his hands and his shoulders started to shake.\n“Now Philips,” the Inspector said gently. “I suggest you tell Mr. Forbes that you discovered the necklace during your round of duties and so return it to its rightful owner. If you are yearning for extra funds, I suggest that you write a book. A first-hand account of the terrifying attacks of the Scarecrow Slasher will certainly not be left to gather dust on the shelves.”",

The idea of a psychopath incensed at scarecrows to the point of manically ripping them to shreds had been rather appealing to him, at least compared with spending Friday afternoon filling out dreary paperwork. The more time he spent with Mr. Forbes, however, the more he regretted not being back at the station. “Why not just stop putting a scarecrow out?” Gregson asked. “What?! Let them win? I have a business to run here. People come to look around the house. My grandfather was a great explorer and we have some of his things here for visitors to see. There is an amusing idea that he hid treasure somewhere on the grounds. Besides, if I stop putting out a scarecrow, what’s to say it won’t provoke whoever is doing this? What’s to say they won’t come after me that very night?” “All right, all right,” the inspector said wearily, as he raised his hands to stop the tirade. “I’d like to speak to the other people in your household: the cook, the maid and the butler.” The maid, Annie, was a shy girl of twenty who was working at the house for the summer. She gave Gregson the impression that she wasn’t much relishing her job and was outspoken in her dislike of Mr. Forbes. Gregson wondered if Annie would take such extreme measures to frighten her boss. When Gregson questioned her, she told him that she had been too frightened to sleep the previous night. She had tried to calm her nerves by pacing her room and had occasionally glanced out the window towards the figure of the scarecrow. “I felt ever so sorry for him, sir, the poor scarecrow all alone out there in the night. And then the slasher came.” ‘You saw someone!’ The inspector exclaimed. “Not clearly, but I saw a single figure cross the field from the house. The person prowled along, very agile, like a cat, and darted from one shrubbery and potted plant to another, as if trying to stay hidden. When the figure got up to the scarecrow, he – or she, I suppose – seemed to attack it. Then I saw the gleam of a knife, shining silver in the moonlight. It was dreadful.” “Do you recall the time when you saw the slasher?” “Yes, I had looked at the clock just before I looked out the window. It was twenty minutes past eleven.” This matched exactly the time that his superior had said Mr. Forbes had called in the crime. Gregson went to the ground floor to interview the cook, a woman named Mrs. Avery. She met him as he was approaching the kitchens. She had a bad limp that seemed to encumber her movement to a great extent. To the inspector’s surprise, Mrs. Avery produced a large set of keys from her pocket and unlocked the door. “You lock the house kitchen?” Gregson asked. “I have to, sir. The butler has taken it into his head to help himself to provisions and I can’t baby-sit him as well as run this house. I can barely keep up with the work. The maid is too flighty and feeble to even help me with the washing let alone any of the heavy work. The butler seems more interested in loitering in here, probably trying to pinch food, than doing any real work. I even have to make up the scarecrow, only to have it ripped to shreds every night. As if I don’t have enough to do already.” “Philips doesn't look like a man with a large appetite,” the inspector said, laughing. “Perhaps he is developing one.” “Developing, Mrs. Avery? How long have you had to lock him out like this?” “Four days, sir. I remember exactly because he started up this silly behaviour when I sorted out the attic for old clothes to put on that wretched scarecrow. You can see the spare ones over there in the corner.” The inspector nodded. “Thank you, Mrs. Avery. That will be all. Please tell Mr. Philips I wish to see him now.” Mrs. Avery left while Inspector Gregson squatted down and rooted through the spare clothes. After a few moments, he drew his hand out from the pile and wrapped around his fingers was a beautiful, glittering necklace.” “Why do you need to see me?” The butler snapped from the doorway. “I was hoping that you could answer some questions for me,” Gregson said. “Have you seen or heard anything relating to these scarecrow slashings that could shed some light on the matter?” “Seen nothing, heard nothing,” came the curt reply. “Where were you last night between eleven o'clock and midnight?” The inspector asked. “Sleeping in my bed, like any decent person. Is that against the law?” “Not at all,” Gregson said. “And may I ask what has caused your recent increase in appetite? An appetite so intense, it seems, that Mrs. Avery felt it necessary to lock you out of the kitchen?” The butler's face became a scowl. “High and mighty Mrs. Avery. She locks the kitchen because she can. She has a petty position of power and enjoys lording it over me.” “Well, thank you for your co-operation,” the inspector said, dryly. “Perhaps it will interest you to know that I have reached my conclusion as to the identity of the scarecrow slasher.”",

      "answer": "(d) Philips",
      "outcome": "“I knew it had to be someone in the house, since the figure of the slasher was seen to cross the field to the scarecrow from the direction of the house,” Gregson explained. “It couldn’t have been Mr. Forbes because he was on the phone with the police when the slasher was spotted by the maid. The maid also told me that the figure was very agile, which rules out the cook; with her bad leg her movement is cumbersome at best.”\n“Why believe everything Annie says?” The butler snapped. “She could have done it!”\n“No,” said Inspector Gregson. “Mrs. Avery told me that Annie can barely help with the household chores. If she cannot lug piles of sheets around, I doubt that she has the strength to hack scarecrows to pieces with a blade, and she certainly can’t cut wooden poles clean through.\n“It's also extraordinary that your sudden burst of appetite started the day of the first scarecrow incident. It’s quite clear to me, Philips, that you wanted to get the scarecrow’s clothes, or rather something in the clothes, since you destroyed them in the process of searching them.”\nGregson held up the sparkling necklace for Philips to see.\nPhilips wrung his hands together. “I’ve not harmed anyone,” he wailed. “It has often been suggested that the old master of the house concealed something of great value within these walls. Over the years I’ve searched for it and then all of a sudden Mrs. Avery found those old clothes to use for the scarecrow, I’d have looked through them in my own time but she locked me out of the kitchen. I knew that if I destroyed the scarecrows she’d have to make new ones and gradually I’d be able to search all the clothes.”\nPhilips hid his face behind his hands and his shoulders started to shake.\n“Now Philips,” the Inspector said gently. “I suggest you tell Mr. Forbes that you discovered the necklace during your round of duties and so return it to its rightful owner. If you are yearning for extra funds, I suggest that you write a book. A first-hand account of the terrifying attacks of the Scarecrow Slasher will certainly not be left to gather dust on the shelves.”"
