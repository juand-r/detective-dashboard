    "full_text": "The Westbrook High School gymnasium was decorated in WHS colors, green and gold. Volunteers spent most of the day hanging decorations and bringing in tables and chairs, while a kitchen crew prepared turkeys that would be served to hundreds of baseball fans at the upcoming dinner presentation. The rain that started in the late afternoon turned the parking lot into a mud bowl. But that didn’t dampen our spirits – not by a long shot. It was the first time in fifteen years that a Westbrook High School varsity team had won a state championship, a real thrill for one of the smallest schools in the state’s A League. That ranking was a remnant of the days when Westbrook itself had a much larger population. Over the years had come hard times, a factory closing, and families moving away to the further suburbs. But Westbrook High School had held on, with stubborn pride, to its A League ranking, competing against much larger high schools. Well, come to think of it, what other school in the state had received a personal visit from Derek Jeter, star shortstop of the New York Yankees? As generous with his time as he was gifted in the field, Jeter had hosted a baseball clinic at WHS last spring, as the baseball season began. Before he left, Jeter personally signed and dated a brand new second base bag, which was put in a locked display case to inspire the team. That spring, the Westbrook Black Sox – out of nowhere – had a winning season. Correct that – they had a spectacular season! They led the A League for the very first time. Coach Morgan claimed it wasn’t any of his doing. The Derek Jeter magic must have rubbed off on the team. And now, at tonight’s banquet, the high school sports commissioner would visit Westbrook for the first time. Students made jokes about it, “… Bet he needs a map to find us!” There were even rumors that Derek Jeter himself, who we all believed had kept tabs on our baseball team throughout the season, might come. But all of the excitement would end when Principal Carol Jackson came to me in distress. “Sam,” she said, “there’s been a robbery. I just can’t believe it. The display case! Mary Thornton just told me that our prize base is missing!” Why she was calling this to my attention, I can’t say. (Maybe it’s because I’m the very smart editor of our school newspaper, the Tribune?) Anyway, I followed where her bony finger was pointing, straight at the display case. The door was closed, and there was empty space where the autographed second base used to be. I felt sick. “Find out what’s going on, will you? People will be arriving in less than an hour.” I saw Coach Joe Morgan in his nearby office, his door wide open as usual, students going in and out. I gave him the news, adding that the principal told me to find out what had happened. “Glad you’re interested in sports, Sam. We could have used some support during our baseball season. The Tribune didn’t pay us much attention. Not that we needed it!” “Yes, sir.” I could see that he wasn’t going to be of much help. I remembered from Law and Order reruns that people often sounded like wise guys when they were facing an investigation. I’d find out what happened, and that would make a nice addition to my resumé when it came time to apply for admission to college next year. Sam Waters on the case! What would a Law and Order detective want to know? Of course … “Mr. Morgan, who had access to the display case during the cleanup this afternoon?” He thought for a minute, “There are just two sets of keys to the display cases. I have one set, and the principal keeps the other set. I gave my keys to Randy Newsom. He had some help cleaning the case this afternoon. Shorty Gilstrap was with him.” That made sense. Randy Newsom was the baseball team’s all-star captain, and Shorty, appropriately, played shortstop. They were an inseparable combination, on and off the field. I spoke with Randy first. “Sure, Coach Martin asked me and Shorty to clean the case.” “And ...” “We took everything out, the dusted the case. I thought it looked better, but it was just getting dirtier. Plus, Shorty had just come from Art 101, and I was worried that he would get paint on the windows, or on the trophies. … Not that we have many trophies.” “What happened then?” “Well, fortunately, Mary Thornton came by, proudly wearing her cheerleading uniform. She sure does look great in that uniform. It fits her perfectly …” “Randy. Focus! What happened with the display case?” “Oh, right. Well, Mary knew about cleaning stuff. She even had some Windex. We took everything out of the display case once again, and she sprayed the glass windows. Then she wiped them dry. ‘Put them back where you want them,’ she said. I did, and then she left. I had to run, so I gave the keys to Shorty.” “When did you notice that the second base was missing, Randy?” “I didn’t … it’s missing?” “So you put back everything in its place?” “Yes. I did. By the way, I was there most of the time. I only went to grab some Cokes. Then I had to go pick up my date for the banquet.” “Thanks, Randy. That helps a lot.” I sounded more confident than I actually felt. (Well, that’s how they sounded on Law and Order.) Next on my list of suspects: Shorty Gilstrap. “What’s up, dude?” he said. “I hear you were helping Randy clean the display case.” “For a minute or so. But I couldn’t stay long. I had to help bring in tables.” “Wait a second. Was the second base there when you left to see Coach Morgan?” “Absolutely, cross my heart -- and oh, yes, I returned the keys to Coach Morgan.” Next, I spotted Mary Thornton walking toward her locker, decked out in her cheerleading uniform, her sweater dangling below her waist, looking two sizes too big. “Hi Mary. Got a minute?” “Sure. What’s going on? Looking for a scoop for the Tribune?” “Something like that. Randy told me you were a big help in cleaning that display case.” “Somebody had to. Those two were totally hopeless. It seemed to be getting even dirtier, if you can imagine such a thing. Shorty’s nickname should be Pigpen!” “So everything was there when you left?” “I’m quite sure that everything was still there. Later, I did go back and take a second look. One of the trophies was just a bit off center. That annoyed me. I’d been working all day. Even had to take off my sweater, to keep it clean for the banquet. I got some keys from the principal, opened the door, moved the trophy, and then locked the case and returned the keys to her.” “Thanks, Mary. Now I know what happened to our famous souvenir.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  No one talks openly about why he / she would want the base, but a signed, game-used “Derek Jeter” base is worth real money.  \n   •  Of the three students, only Mary is not on the team; she gets the glory of the banquet without ever having shared in the season itself.  A souvenir that can be sold (or used for attention) is a real temptation.\n\n2.  Opportunity / Key control  \n   •  Two keys exist – one set with Coach Morgan (given to Randy, then to Shorty, then back to the Coach) and one set with Principal Jackson (later taken by Mary).  \n   •  Chronology \n      –  Randy and Shorty empty, dust, re-fill the case – the base is still there. \n      –  Randy leaves, giving Coach’s keys to Shorty. \n      –  Shorty leaves almost at once to carry tables and immediately returns the keys to Coach Morgan. \n      –  From that moment on, only the principal’s key could open the case – and Mary admits borrowing that key “to straighten a trophy.”  \n   •  Therefore the ONLY person who had lawful access to the case during the interval in which the base disappeared is Mary Thornton.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / contradictions  \n   •  Narrator’s first sight of Mary:  “Her sweater was dangling below her waist, looking two sizes too big.”  \n     –  A regulation second base is 15 x 15 in (about 38 x 38 cm) and 2–3 in thick – easily hidden under an oversized sweater if held flat against the stomach.  \n   •  Mary herself says she “took off my sweater to keep it clean for the banquet.”  Yet moments later she is wearing it – and it looks huge.  That inconsistency only makes sense if she slipped the sweater back on to hide the base.\n\n4.  Alibis  \n   •  Randy was gone, first for Cokes, then to get his date; he had no key after leaving.  \n   •  Shorty returned the only key he possessed to Coach almost immediately and was seen lugging tables in the mud-filled parking lot.  \n   •  Coach and Principal were surrounded by students and helpers all afternoon; neither had reason or privacy to steal the base.\n\n5.  Logical deduction  \n   •  The base vanished after Shorty locked the case but before Mary finally locked it with the principal’s key.  \n   •  Mary is the only person who (a) had a key during that interval, (b) had privacy inside the gym, and (c) wore a garment big enough to conceal the bulky object.  Her own words supply the slip (“took off my sweater …” though she is later seen wearing it and it now looks far larger).\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRandy Newsom, Shorty Gilstrap, Mary Thornton, Coach Joe Morgan, Principal Carol Jackson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMary Thornton\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Coach Morgan lends his set of display-case keys to Randy so Randy and Shorty can clean the case.\n2. While they work, the signed second base is still in place.\n3. Mary arrives, supplies Windex, and persuades Randy to put all items back.  Shortly afterwards Randy leaves, handing the keys to Shorty.\n4. Almost immediately Shorty is called away to carry tables.  He closes and locks the case, then returns Coach’s keys.\n5. The case now can only be opened with the principal’s key.  Mary, noticing that she is again alone beside the trophy case, deliberately asks Principal Jackson for that key, claiming she wants to “center a trophy.”\n6. Mary unlocks the case, lifts out the valuable Jeter-signed base, slips it under her oversized cheer-sweater, relocks the case, and casually returns the key.\n7. Because the base is flat and square, it simply makes the sweater hang lower and appear “two sizes too big,” exactly as Sam observes.\n8. Minutes later the absence of the base is discovered.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Randy Newsom – He no longer had any key after leaving; witnesses saw him in the soda-machine area and then off campus picking up his date.  He also could not have hidden the base without a bulky change in appearance, which Sam does not mention.  \n• Shorty Gilstrap – Had the key only briefly and was in constant view moving tables in the muddy parking lot.  He could not both haul tables and hide a large square object under his baseball uniform.  \n• Coach Joe Morgan – Never approached the case after lending the key and was busy in his open office surrounded by students.  \n• Principal Carol Jackson – Gave the key to Mary but remained occupied with arriving guests and staff.  She could not have opened the case unseen, nor was there any change in her clothing that could conceal the base.\n\nTherefore, all clues converge on one person: Mary Thornton is the thief.",

    "reveal_text": "I saw Principal Carol Jackson going into the faculty room near the gymnasium door, and followed her into the room.\n“An interesting case,” I said. “By the way, nobody told a lie. But nobody quite told the whole story, either. The only three students with access to the open display case were Randy Newsom, Mary Thornton and Shorty Gilstrap.”\n“What about Coach Morgan?” she asked.\n“Coach Morgan’s office is in plain sight, so he couldn’t have taken the base. After the display case was cleaned, Randy had to leave, and Shorty returned the keys to Coach Morgan. Plus, Randy didn’t even know the base was missing. And Shorty barely touched anything because he had paint all over himself.”\n“It’s quite obvious then, yes?”\n“Yes. That leaves Mary. To her perfectionist eye, the boys probably had left a display off center, as she says. But that was just an excuse. She didn’t exactly say the base was missing when she got the keys from you. I think she got your keys, opened the case, adjusted the display, and wrapped the second base bag up in her sweater, which would explain why it now looks stretched, two sizes too big.”\nPrincipal Carol Jackson turned red, “Sam, Coach Morgan has something to tell us. He wanted it to be a surprise to me, too!”\n“This is why I wanted the display case cleaned,” Coach Morgan said. “And also why I asked Mary to “steal” the second base from the case for me. Both Randy and Shorty were out of the building when I needed them, and Mary happened to be right there.”\n“I don’t understand?” I said.\nThis was supposed to be a surprise – not a mystery. … There’s somebody you should meet.”\n“Hi kid,” came the cheerful, commanding voice of the shortstop of the New York Yankees. “Looks like it’ll be a great banquet, after a terrific baseball season. Coach Morgan asked me to write “A League Champions” on this second base bag, above my signature. Hope it makes a good story for your newspaper.”\n“Yes, sir,” I stammered. It really was quite a story -- both the one I would write, and the one I would now keep to myself!",

I gave him the news, adding that the principal told me to find out what had happened. “Glad you’re interested in sports, Sam. We could have used some support during our baseball season. The Tribune didn’t pay us much attention. Not that we needed it!” “Yes, sir.” I could see that he wasn’t going to be of much help. I remembered from Law and Order reruns that people often sounded like wise guys when they were facing an investigation. I’d find out what happened, and that would make a nice addition to my resumé when it came time to apply for admission to college next year. Sam Waters on the case! What would a Law and Order detective want to know? Of course … “Mr. Morgan, who had access to the display case during the cleanup this afternoon?” He thought for a minute, “There are just two sets of keys to the display cases. I have one set, and the principal keeps the other set. I gave my keys to Randy Newsom. He had some help cleaning the case this afternoon. Shorty Gilstrap was with him.” That made sense. Randy Newsom was the baseball team’s all-star captain, and Shorty, appropriately, played shortstop. They were an inseparable combination, on and off the field. I spoke with Randy first. “Sure, Coach Martin asked me and Shorty to clean the case.” “And ...” “We took everything out, the dusted the case. I thought it looked better, but it was just getting dirtier. Plus, Shorty had just come from Art 101, and I was worried that he would get paint on the windows, or on the trophies. … Not that we have many trophies.” “What happened then?” “Well, fortunately, Mary Thornton came by, proudly wearing her cheerleading uniform. She sure does look great in that uniform. It fits her perfectly …” “Randy. Focus! What happened with the display case?” “Oh, right. Well, Mary knew about cleaning stuff. She even had some Windex. We took everything out of the display case once again, and she sprayed the glass windows. Then she wiped them dry. ‘Put them back where you want them,’ she said. I did, and then she left. I had to run, so I gave the keys to Shorty.” “When did you notice that the second base was missing, Randy?” “I didn’t … it’s missing?” “So you put back everything in its place?” “Yes. I did. By the way, I was there most of the time. I only went to grab some Cokes. Then I had to go pick up my date for the banquet.” “Thanks, Randy. That helps a lot.” I sounded more confident than I actually felt. (Well, that’s how they sounded on Law and Order.) Next on my list of suspects: Shorty Gilstrap. “What’s up, dude?” he said. “I hear you were helping Randy clean the display case.” “For a minute or so. But I couldn’t stay long. I had to help bring in tables.” “Wait a second. Was the second base there when you left to see Coach Morgan?” “Absolutely, cross my heart -- and oh, yes, I returned the keys to Coach Morgan.” Next, I spotted Mary Thornton walking toward her locker, decked out in her cheerleading uniform, her sweater dangling below her waist, looking two sizes too big. “Hi Mary. Got a minute?” “Sure. What’s going on? Looking for a scoop for the Tribune?” “Something like that. Randy told me you were a big help in cleaning that display case.” “Somebody had to. Those two were totally hopeless. It seemed to be getting even dirtier, if you can imagine such a thing. Shorty’s nickname should be Pigpen!” “So everything was there when you left?” “I’m quite sure that everything was still there. Later, I did go back and take a second look. One of the trophies was just a bit off center. That annoyed me. I’d been working all day. Even had to take off my sweater, to keep it clean for the banquet. I got some keys from the principal, opened the door, moved the trophy, and then locked the case and returned the keys to her.” “Thanks, Mary. Now I know what happened to our famous souvenir.”",

      "outcome": "I saw Principal Carol Jackson going into the faculty room near the gymnasium door, and followed her into the room.\n“An interesting case,” I said. “By the way, nobody told a lie. But nobody quite told the whole story, either. The only three students with access to the open display case were Randy Newsom, Mary Thornton and Shorty Gilstrap.”\n“What about Coach Morgan?” she asked.\n“Coach Morgan’s office is in plain sight, so he couldn’t have taken the base. After the display case was cleaned, Randy had to leave, and Shorty returned the keys to Coach Morgan. Plus, Randy didn’t even know the base was missing. And Shorty barely touched anything because he had paint all over himself.”\n“It’s quite obvious then, yes?”\n“Yes. That leaves Mary. To her perfectionist eye, the boys probably had left a display off center, as she says. But that was just an excuse. She didn’t exactly say the base was missing when she got the keys from you. I think she got your keys, opened the case, adjusted the display, and wrapped the second base bag up in her sweater, which would explain why it now looks stretched, two sizes too big.”\nPrincipal Carol Jackson turned red, “Sam, Coach Morgan has something to tell us. He wanted it to be a surprise to me, too!”\n“This is why I wanted the display case cleaned,” Coach Morgan said. “And also why I asked Mary to “steal” the second base from the case for me. Both Randy and Shorty were out of the building when I needed them, and Mary happened to be right there.”\n“I don’t understand?” I said.\nThis was supposed to be a surprise – not a mystery. … There’s somebody you should meet.”\n“Hi kid,” came the cheerful, commanding voice of the shortstop of the New York Yankees. “Looks like it’ll be a great banquet, after a terrific baseball season. Coach Morgan asked me to write “A League Champions” on this second base bag, above my signature. Hope it makes a good story for your newspaper.”\n“Yes, sir,” I stammered. It really was quite a story -- both the one I would write, and the one I would now keep to myself!"
