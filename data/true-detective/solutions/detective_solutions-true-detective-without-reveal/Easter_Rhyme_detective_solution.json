After all the eggs were hid, \nMary wondered what they did? Someone hid them -- then was gone --\nleaving presents on the lawn. \"Where'd that Easter Bunny go?\"\nMary felt she had to know. Past the park, where lilies grew,\nthere's a stream that trickles through. Past its bridge, across a field\nblooming flowers were revealed. Mary spotted luscious hills,\nshining bright with daffodils, \"Maybe if I'm not a dum-dum\nI'll learn where these lilies come from!\" But instead, the meadow air\nseemed to glow a magic glare. On the grass, below her legs -- \nshone a thousand Easter eggs! And the eggs were just a fraction\nof the crazy Easter action.

We've been outted!\" Then one thousand bunnies turned,\ncurious what Mary learned. \"Look at her! She's found the clues.\"\n\"And she's wearing pretty shoes.\" In the flowers, bunnies rose\nwiggling each pinkish nose. White fur, brown fur -- some were grey.\nThey were everywhere today! \"See these eggs that we'll be sharing?\nHiding them takes some preparing!\" said the smartest bunny rabbit.\nHe's the boss. His name is Abbot. \"Hiding well takes several tries.\nSo I teach -- I supervise!\" \"He's just lazy,\" joked another.\nIt was Randy -- Abbot's brother.

Breezes brushed across her face.\nlike a rabbit in a race. \"I'm Speedy,\" the bunny said\n(Cloud-white fur and eyes of red). \"It takes work to hide those eggs\nso I exercise my legs!\" Abbot said, \"His pride's quite clear.\nHe's the fastest bunny here!\" Randy laid down six bright eggs.\nSpeedy crouched down on his legs. \"Watch him now.

There was grass now, nothing more.\nWhere the eggs had been before. \"Presto!\" Speedy yelled to Randy.\n\"Find them, and I'll give you candy!\" Randy grumbled, then said, \"Speedy,\nFor your candy, I'll be greedy.\" In a hole he disappeared.\nBut TWO Randys re-appeared. \"Look,\" said Randy, \"Ain't this handy?\nThis is my twin brother, Andy!\" More bad jokes, and grey fur too!\"\n\"He's like Randy.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish what the “crime” is  \n   • It is not a violent crime; the mystery is: Who secretly slipped an Easter egg into Mary’s pocket after Abbot had refused to give her one?  \n   • So the “culprit” is the bunny who covertly gave Mary the souvenir egg.\n\n2. List the characters who could have done it  \n   • Abbot – head rabbit, white? (colour not given), refuses to give eggs, offers flowers instead.  \n   • Randy – grey with silver legs, only hides dark-grey eggs, wise-guy attitude.  \n   • Andy – Randy’s identical twin, also grey, same egg colour traits.  \n   • Speedy – cloud-white, red-eyed, prides himself on extreme speed, earlier creates a wind/breeze when he moves.\n\n3. Analyse physical evidence – the egg that appeared  \n   • Colour: “blue and yellow too, just as though its dye was new.”  \n   • Therefore it cannot be Randy’s or Andy’s (they hide exclusively dark-grey eggs).  \n   • Abbot had just denied Mary an egg and gave her a lily instead.  \n   • The rabbit capable of darting in, unseen, is Speedy; the text twice mentions a quick breeze around Mary, once when Speedy first demonstrated and again as she is walking back (“Once she even felt some breezes.”).\n\n4. Motive  \n   • Abbot explicitly refuses → unlikely to change his mind and then do it covertly.  \n   • Randy/Andy are jokesters but they would need a non-grey egg, which conflicts with the story detail that they hide only dark-grey eggs.  \n   • Speedy likes games and challenges (“Find them, and I’ll give you candy!”) and obviously enjoys impressive feats. Slipping an egg into Mary’s pocket unseen is exactly his style.\n\n5. Opportunity / alibi  \n   • All rabbits remain in the meadow when Mary turns to leave. Nothing stops any of them from following, but only Speedy can overtake her, plant an egg, and return without being noticed.  \n   • The breeze felt by Mary on departure is a textual clue identical to the earlier description of Speedy’s movements.\n\n6. Logical deduction  \n   • Grey-egg rabbits are ruled out by colour.  \n   • Abbot is ruled out by stated refusal and his seriousness.  \n   • Only Speedy matches the colour possibility, the ability, and the breeze clue.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAbbot, Randy, Andy, Speedy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nSpeedy (alias “Speedy the Bunny” – white fur, red eyes)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter Abbot declined Mary’s request for an egg and presented her with a lily, Mary started back toward the park and church.  \nSpeedy, feeling grateful to Mary for keeping their secret and eager to perform one more dazzling stunt, decided to give her a souvenir anyway. While Mary walked away, Speedy dashed after her. His rapid passage produced the light breeze Mary noticed. With a quick, precise motion he slid a freshly dyed blue-and-yellow Easter egg (one of the practice eggs he had rolled earlier) into the pocket of her dress and sped back to the meadow before Abbot or the twins realised what he had done.  \nMary discovered the egg only when she reached the park gate, believing at first that it was all a dream, until the colourful egg proved Speedy’s clandestine kindness.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAbbot – He explicitly refused Mary an egg and, true to his responsible nature, would not contradict his own ruling. No evidence places him near Mary after she left, and he lacks Speedy’s stealthy speed.\n\nRandy – His trademark eggs are dark grey, not blue-and-yellow. Additionally, he and Andy were pre-occupied hunting Speedy’s hidden eggs and have no special speed to reach Mary unnoticed.\n\nAndy – Same limitations as Randy: grey eggs only, busy in the meadow, no ability mentioned that would let him approach and return unseen.\n\nTherefore, only Speedy had the motive, capability, opportunity, and matching evidence.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
