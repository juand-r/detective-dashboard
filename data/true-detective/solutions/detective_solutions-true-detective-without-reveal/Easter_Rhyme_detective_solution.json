After all the eggs were hid, \nMary wondered what they did? Someone hid them -- then was gone --\nleaving presents on the lawn. \"Where'd that Easter Bunny go?\"\nMary felt she had to know. Past the park, where lilies grew,\nthere's a stream that trickles through. Past its bridge, across a field\nblooming flowers were revealed. Mary spotted luscious hills,\nshining bright with daffodils, \"Maybe if I'm not a dum-dum\nI'll learn where these lilies come from!\" But instead, the meadow air\nseemed to glow a magic glare. On the grass, below her legs -- \nshone a thousand Easter eggs! And the eggs were just a fraction\nof the crazy Easter action. There, to practice hiding habits,\nMary saw a thousand rabbits! \"Hey, who's that?\" a bunny shouted.\n\"We've been spotted! We've been outted!\" Then one thousand bunnies turned,\ncurious what Mary learned. \"Look at her! She's found the clues.\"\n\"And she's wearing pretty shoes.\" In the flowers, bunnies rose\nwiggling each pinkish nose. White fur, brown fur -- some were grey.\nThey were everywhere today! \"See these eggs that we'll be sharing?\nHiding them takes some preparing!\" said the smartest bunny rabbit.\nHe's the boss. His name is Abbot. \"Hiding well takes several tries.\nSo I teach -- I supervise!\" \"He's just lazy,\" joked another.\nIt was Randy -- Abbot's brother. Randy's grey, with silver legs.\nHe hid only dark grey eggs. He'd make jokes both dark and funny,\nlike a wise-guy Easter bunny! And when Abbot tried to preach,\nRandy found new things to teach. \"Randy, it's important we \nhide our treasures carefully.\" \"Lazy -- that's what's wrong with him.\nAbbot needs to hit the gym!\" Mary laughed, but suddenly\none bright flash whizzed instantly! Breezes brushed across her face.\nlike a rabbit in a race. \"I'm Speedy,\" the bunny said\n(Cloud-white fur and eyes of red). \"It takes work to hide those eggs\nso I exercise my legs!\" Abbot said, \"His pride's quite clear.\nHe's the fastest bunny here!\" Randy laid down six bright eggs.\nSpeedy crouched down on his legs. \"Watch him now. Each egg he budges.\nHe'll roll it with careful nudges.\" Speedy stared, as though deciding \nwhere the eggs should all be hiding. Then he yelled, \"It' so much fun.\nCount me down now. 3, 2, 1\" Poof! He vanished! Blurs of white!\nEvery egg rolled out of sight! There was grass now, nothing more.\nWhere the eggs had been before. \"Presto!\" Speedy yelled to Randy.\n\"Find them, and I'll give you candy!\" Randy grumbled, then said, \"Speedy,\nFor your candy, I'll be greedy.\" In a hole he disappeared.\nBut TWO Randys re-appeared. \"Look,\" said Randy, \"Ain't this handy?\nThis is my twin brother, Andy!\" More bad jokes, and grey fur too!\"\n\"He's like Randy. Now there's two!\" Abbot muttered, \"What a psyche.\nEverything they do alike -- Walking, talking, hiding eggs.\nAnd they both have silver legs!\" Twitching whiskers soon detected.\nFrom their hole, the two ejected, Two grey bunnies raced around\nhelping Speedy's eggs get found. But then Mary had a thought\nsomething big that she'd forgot. \"Whoops! It's Sunday. Time for church!\"\n\"Hey! Don't leave us in a lurch!\" Bunny friends all gathered round her\nSaying they were glad they'd found her. Giving her an Easter cheer, \nPromising they'd meet next year. \"Could I have a souvenir\nTo remember I've been here?\" Mary knew she had to ask it \nEying Randy's Easter basket. \"Randy is so good at finding.\nJust one egg could be reminding!\" Abbot shook his ears and said,\n\"I give flowers out instead. \"All these eggs are spoken for.\nJust for Easter.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. List every rabbit that appears in the story  \n • Abbot – the “boss,” gives out flowers, not eggs.  \n • Randy – joker, hides only dark-grey eggs.  \n • Andy – Randy’s identical twin, therefore also associated with dark-grey eggs.  \n • Speedy – white-fur, red-eyed, prides himself on being the fastest; a blur of wind accompanies his movements.\n\n2. Notice the decisive facts about the hidden egg  \n • Colour: blue and yellow (not dark grey).  \n • Manner of delivery: slipped secretly into Mary’s pocket after she had left the meadow.  \n • Mary “felt some breezes” on her walk – the very same wording the narrator earlier used when Speedy first dashed past her (“Breezes brushed across her face like a rabbit in a race”).\n\n3. Check each suspect against the evidence  \n\n Abbot – publicly told everyone, including Mary, that he hands out only flowers and that “all these eggs are spoken for.”   \n  • Motive: None (he wants to keep all eggs for the children).  \n  • Opportunity: Could have, but would contradict his own rule.  \n  • Colour mismatch? Not specified, but his stated policy rules him out.\n\n Randy – specifically described as hiding “only dark-grey eggs.”  \n  • Colour mismatch with the discovered blue-and-yellow egg; also he had already crawled back into his hole with Andy.\n\n Andy – same limitations as Randy.\n\n Speedy – the only rabbit whose trademark is speed; whenever he moves the text mentions wind or breezes.  \n  • Opportunity: Easily able to overtake Mary unnoticed on her walk.  \n  • Physical clue: the breeze Mary feels just before the egg appears mirrors Speedy’s earlier entrance.  \n  • Motive: He thinks egg-hiding is “so much fun” and likes to show off; also he is not under Abbot’s strict “flowers only” rule in the same way Randy is bound to grey eggs.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n • Only Speedy has the combination of motive (fun, show-off), means (incredible speed), and opportunity (slip the egg during the unnoticed windy flash).  \n • Colour evidence eliminates Randy/Andy, policy evidence eliminates Abbot.  \n ⇒ Therefore, Speedy is the guilty Easter Bunny.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAbbot, Randy, Andy, Speedy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nSpeedy (alias “Speedy the Bunny”)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter supervising the test-hiding of eggs, Abbot dismisses the rabbits and Mary heads back toward the park and church, lily in hand, pockets empty except for her keys.  \nSpeedy, delighted by Mary’s friendliness and eager to perform one last flashy trick, decides to give her a secret souvenir despite Abbot’s rule against handing eggs to outsiders.  \nWaiting until Mary is alone, Speedy races up behind her, the rush of his passage producing the same breeze Mary felt earlier when he first appeared. In that split second he slips a freshly dyed blue-and-yellow egg into her pocket and dashes away unseen.  \nLater, seated in church, Mary discovers the egg and realises someone has left her a gift—though only we, following the clues, can identify that someone as Speedy.\n\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAbbot: Publicly insisted no eggs be taken; his chosen gift is lilies. Nothing suggests he would break his own rule.  \nRandy: All of his eggs are dark grey, whereas the found egg is brightly coloured.  \nAndy: Indistinguishable from Randy and therefore tied to grey eggs as well; also last seen underground with Randy.  \nOnly Speedy had brightly coloured eggs, the trademark windy arrival/departure, and the ability to approach Mary without being observed.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
