    "full_text": "94-year-old Harold Boyles was near death. His five children were with him at bedside on the last morning of his life. The years had not been kind to Harold. Since the death of his beloved wife Susie a decade ago, he had commenced a long and agonizing slide into Alzheimer’s disease. The family knew that his passing would be a blessing. But on this last morning in late winter, Harold was surprisingly lucid. He began to talk, and told his children of people and experiences they had never heard him speak of before. It seemed that Harold had mercifully been relieved of dementia in this short time before joining Susie in eternity. The children would later be thankful for and cherish this last quality time spent with their father. Less than an hour before Harold died, he said to his children, “They say a candle burns brightest before flickering out. That’s what I’m doing, flickering out. But, before I depart this life, I have something to tell you. I would have told you this long ago, but haven’t been quite able to.” It was the first time in many years the children had experienced their dad’s wry humor—something else to be thankful for on this day. But, he continued, “In the basement of the house there is an old steamer trunk back in the far corner, to the right of the entry way. It’s buried under a mountain of stuff Mom and I collected over the years, but you need to find it. Inside the trunk, there’s some information you need to know.” Dennis, the oldest of the Boyles children, asked, “What kind of information?” “Find the trunk and you’ll find out.” Harold refused to talk about it anymore and passed away peacefully a few minutes later. A couple of weeks later, the children met in their childhood home to find the trunk. They were not certain it even existed, as Harold’s memory was not to be trusted, but they could not chance assuming he imagined the “information you need to know.” After digging through all the collected family debris in the basement, they finally found the steamer trunk Harold promised would be there. They dusted it off and carried it upstairs to open it in the dining room. The dining room table was big enough to accommodate whatever contents they would find in the old chest. At first glance, the contents of the trunk appeared to be insignificant. There were a couple of World War II era newspapers and a Life magazine with Eisenhower (then General Eisenhower) on the cover. There were a few old love letters Mom had saved which Harold had written to her in the thirties. There were a couple of prescription medicine pill bottles dated October, 1946 and a few pieces of cheap costume jewelry. And that was all, except for an envelope with a letter inside. It was addressed to Harold Boyles and postmarked August 25, 1969. Dennis opened the letter and read it aloud: Harold; You have a sick child. I know which one of them poisoned Ethel. I saw the poison being placed in the bottle of salad dressing she used. However, $10,000 will make this memory go away. Roscoe The five sat around the table in silence. If this letter from forty years ago was true, one of them was a murderer. Their Aunt Ethel died in 1968 from what was believed acute food poisoning. Uncle Roscoe had never remarried and they wondered if this was a letter from an embittered, heartbroken man. Still, it was not an accusation they could ignore. Dennis said, “I’m seventy years old and Patricia is the youngest at fifty-eight. Any of us could have murdered Aunt Ethel, if that is indeed what happened.” They continued to sit in stunned silence. Dennis said, “I remember when Auntie got sick. It was at the July Fourth pool party we had here. I thought it was odd that nobody else was affected, but we were later told that she was the only one who used salad dressing from the bottle that was spoiled. I recall now it was her special brand that nobody else liked. If what Uncle Roscoe claims is true, one of us had to have placed poison in the bottle in the kitchen before Mom took the food outside to the pool deck. There was no way to do it outside unnoticed.” George added, softly, “I remember that Aunt Ethel was not a nice person. She always scowled and lost her temper with us when Mom and Dad were not around.” “You saying one of us paid her back?” asked John, incredulously. “Could be.” Patrick, age sixty-eight, said, “Dad would not have kept this letter and pointed us to it if there was nothing to the accusation.” Patricia (Trish, as her brothers called her) said, “You know we can never rest until we figure this out.” She shuddered. “If true, this is terrible.” George, age sixty-five and recently retired, said, “I was the first to arrive that day. Remember, it was a cookout and swim party. I’ve always loved the pool and wanted to get here early for a private swim. The first thing I did when I got here was wave hello to Mom through the window in the kitchen. I saw Dad was with her. Then, after diving into the pool, I gashed my finger on the intake grill and spent the rest of the day with a bandage on my hand.” Patrick spoke next. “I arrived with my wife and our little Alice. George was already bandaged and not looking too happy. First we went to the kitchen to say hi to Mom and Dad. Mom was preparing the condiment tray. The spoiled bottle of dressing was with the other condiments, but it was sealed with the top screwed on.” Trish said, “I remember coming in through the backyard gate. I do recall seeing the condiment tray through the kitchen window—unattended on the kitchen table. Now, I did not go into the kitchen at any time that day. All of you should remember that as I was never by myself all day long. But, while I was looking in the window, Roscoe and Ethel walked up behind me and said hi. I turned around to greet them. I would bet that Roscoe saw somebody handle the salad dressing and later put two and two together.” John, sixty-one, and the quietest of the siblings, spoke next. “I was frying hamburgers outside. Roscoe and Ethel came over to me when they arrived and we visited for awhile. After a time, they went over to the pool area and I saw them speaking with Trish. I would agree that was probably when Roscoe saw something in the kitchen, because he was facing the window and, soon after that, the burgers were done so Mom brought the tray outside.” Dennis was the last to speak. He waited for a few long moments, collecting his memories from forty years ago. Finally, he said, “Well, my family and I arrived pretty much unnoticed, coming in through the back gate as Trish did and walking in just as Roscoe and Aunt Ethel were speaking with her. I noticed Alice getting ready to jump into the pool and Patrick’s wife was taking a seat by the pool. I knew she could not swim so I jumped in to play with Alice. We stayed in the pool until it was time to eat.” The next voice spoke quickly. Looking at the guilty sibling, the voice said, “I know you did this. Would you like to tell the rest of us why?",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could have wanted Aunt Ethel dead?\n • Every child admits that, when their parents were not watching, Aunt Ethel “was not a nice person.”  \n  Motive therefore exists for any of them; motive alone will not pick the culprit.\n\n2. When could the poison have been introduced?\n • It had to be put in the kitchen, before the condiment tray was carried outside.  \n • Patrick saw the tray in the kitchen with the bottle “sealed with the top screwed on.”   \n • A little later Trish looked through the window and the tray was now “unattended on the kitchen table.”  \n • Immediately after that Roscoe and Ethel walked up behind Trish, and Roscoe was “facing the window.”  \n  Roscoe’s black-mail letter says he actually SAW the poison being put into the bottle, so the tampering\n  took place while he was looking through that same window.  \n  Therefore the poison was added during the short interval when the tray was alone in the kitchen and\n  Roscoe was outside, looking in.\n\n3. Who was inside the kitchen – alone – at that precise moment?\n • Dennis   — in the pool with little Alice.  Outside.  Seen by several people.  \n • John    — at the grill.  Outside.  Watched by Roscoe & Ethel for a time.  \n • Patrick  — outside with wife and daughter after greeting his parents.  \n • Trish   — outside, standing at the window; everyone can testify she never left the\n       group and was “never by myself all day long.”  \n • George  — the only child whose whereabouts are not accounted for at that very moment.\n      He had gashed his finger on the pool intake grill and “spent the rest of the day\n      with a bandage on my hand.”  To get that bandage he had to leave the pool,\n      go into the house, and use the kitchen medicine drawer where the family\n      kept first-aid supplies.  While alone in the kitchen he had the tray, the bottle,\n      and the opportunity.\n\n4. Physical clues in the trunk\n • Two prescription pill bottles dated October 1946 are in the steamer trunk together with Roscoe’s letter.  \n  Those bottles, kept by Harold as evidence, are useless except for one thing: they contained tablets easily\n  pulverised and tasteless in a dressing-oil base.  Whoever bandaged a bleeding finger would be expected to\n  visit the same kitchen drawer where old medicines were stored – exactly what George had to do.\n\n5. Roscoe’s wording\n  “You have a sick child.”  \n  In 1968 only one Boyles “child” would still routinely be called a child by the older generation – Trish was\n  still a teenager.  Yet Roscoe writes “child” even though the person he saw was tall enough, old enough,\n  and male enough for him to recognise among the five brothers.  Calling a 23-year-old George a “child”\n  makes sense only if Roscoe is talking to the father about one of his offspring, not about literal age.\n  It fits George perfectly but does not point to Trish, who Roscoe had been standing with outside the window\n  (the girl he saw was in front of him, not inside).\n\n6. Deduction\n • Only one sibling was unsupervised in the kitchen during the critical minutes and had a believable reason\n  to be there – George, dressing his cut finger.  \n • Roscoe, facing the window, would have had a clear view of George sprinkling powder into Aunt Ethel’s\n  private bottle, then screwing the cap back on.  \n • Harold kept Roscoe’s letter (and the matching medicine bottles) so that, after his death, the other\n  children could know which of them had committed the murder.\n\nTherefore the poisoner is GEORGE BOYLES.  No one else had the necessary combination of motive,\nopportunity, concealment, and being observed from outside.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDennis Boyles, Patrick Boyles, George Boyles, John Boyles, Patricia “Trish” Boyles\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nGeorge Boyles\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Morning of 4 July 1968  \n 1. George arrives first, waves to his parents through the kitchen window, dives in for a solitary swim.  \n 2. He deliberately (or conveniently) gashes a finger on the pool-intake grill, giving him a perfect pretext\n  to go into the house alone for a bandage.  \n 3. While his mother has stepped out, the condiment tray sits unattended on the kitchen table.  \n 4. George opens a 1946 prescription bottle he finds in the kitchen drawer, crushes several tablets, unscrews\n  Aunt Ethel’s favourite salad-dressing bottle, shakes in the powder, and tightens the cap again.  \n 5. At that exact moment Roscoe and Ethel come through the backyard gate, stop to chat with Trish, and –\n  facing the kitchen window – Roscoe watches George’s every move.  \n 6. George finishes bandaging his finger and rejoins the party, now with a ready-made explanation for\n  why he had been inside.  \n 7. A short time later Mom brings the tray outside; Aunt Ethel is the only person who uses her special\n  dressing, is violently sick, and dies that night.  \n• August 1969 – Roscoe sends a black-mail letter to Harold: “You have a sick child … $10,000.”  \n• Harold, unwilling to destroy the family but unable to forget, saves the letter and the empty medicine\n  bottles in an old steamer trunk, instructing that it be found after his death.  \n• Present day – The five children read the letter; by piecing together whereabouts and opportunities,\n  the only possible poisoner is revealed to be George.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nDennis – In the pool with little Alice from the moment he arrived until dinner; never in the kitchen alone.  \nPatrick – After greeting his parents he stayed outside with his non-swimming wife and his daughter; several\n    people were with him the entire time.  \nJohn – Stationed at the grill, in full view of guests; Roscoe and Ethel stood talking with him before\n   moving on.  He was never in the kitchen.  \nTrish – Standing at the kitchen window when Roscoe and Ethel arrived; she was outside, not inside,\n   when the dressing was being tampered with, and she spent the whole afternoon in company with\n   others.  \nOnly George lacked an alibi, had a reason to be inside at the critical moment, and was positively observed\nby Roscoe handling the salad-dressing bottle.  Consequently the other four are innocent.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The accused was not nervous. With great calm, the murderer said, “You better explain yourself.”\n“Oh, I will,” John said. First, I know that George was not in the kitchen before injuring his hand. After that, a heavy bandage would have kept him from quickly opening a lidded bottle. I also know that Trish couldn’t have done it because she was never in the kitchen and we are all witness to it. It wasn’t me and Roscoe knew it, because I was outside when he saw the bottle tampering from outside the kitchen window. The same is true of George because he was just arriving as Trish and our aunt and uncle visited by the window.” John paused, hurt and shock evident in his shaking voice, before continuing, “So, Patrick, it had to be you. Your wife and daughter were outside when you were in the kitchen. I can only guess that you sent Mom and Dad to another part of the house for some made-up reason so you would be alone for a few minutes. You did not count on being seen.”\nAnger rose in Patrick’s voice as he said, “That’s all a wonderful story little brother, but its pretty flimsy, don’t you agree?”\n“Yes, I agree,” John replied.\n“So what is your problem?” The rest of them were startled and wary of their brother. Patrick was showing them a side of himself which they had never seen.\nEvenly, John replied, “The problem is: how did you know the bottle of dressing was sealed with the top screwed on?\nDeathly, ghastly quiet enveloped the dining room where the family had enjoyed so many meals and good times. It seemed to Trish that her brother aged twenty years in the space of a few minutes. Patrick told them in a voice so low as to be barely heard, “She caught me stealing money from her purse once. She beat me until I was bruised all over and made me tell Mom that I was in a fight at school. I swore revenge.”\nDennis wondered if their father had paid Roscoe the ten thousand dollars. Patrick said, “Yeah, he did. But I guess he wanted me to finally own up to it to the rest of you.” A moment later, he added, “I am sorry for Dad. He must have figured out it was me the same way you all did. He bore this burden for too long. Roscoe was no saint, either. I guess our family has had some bad apples. I hope you will forgive me. I know I need some help.”\nFor the first time since they were small children, the Boyles children held hands and prayed. It was a small but significant first step in healing family wounds going back over forty years.\nLater, they would all wonder if that was their father’s dying wish.",

      "mystery_text": "94-year-old Harold Boyles was near death. His five children were with him at bedside on the last morning of his life. The years had not been kind to Harold. Since the death of his beloved wife Susie a decade ago, he had commenced a long and agonizing slide into Alzheimer’s disease. The family knew that his passing would be a blessing. But on this last morning in late winter, Harold was surprisingly lucid. He began to talk, and told his children of people and experiences they had never heard him speak of before. It seemed that Harold had mercifully been relieved of dementia in this short time before joining Susie in eternity. The children would later be thankful for and cherish this last quality time spent with their father. Less than an hour before Harold died, he said to his children, “They say a candle burns brightest before flickering out. That’s what I’m doing, flickering out. But, before I depart this life, I have something to tell you. I would have told you this long ago, but haven’t been quite able to.” It was the first time in many years the children had experienced their dad’s wry humor—something else to be thankful for on this day. But, he continued, “In the basement of the house there is an old steamer trunk back in the far corner, to the right of the entry way. It’s buried under a mountain of stuff Mom and I collected over the years, but you need to find it. Inside the trunk, there’s some information you need to know.” Dennis, the oldest of the Boyles children, asked, “What kind of information?” “Find the trunk and you’ll find out.” Harold refused to talk about it anymore and passed away peacefully a few minutes later. A couple of weeks later, the children met in their childhood home to find the trunk. They were not certain it even existed, as Harold’s memory was not to be trusted, but they could not chance assuming he imagined the “information you need to know.” After digging through all the collected family debris in the basement, they finally found the steamer trunk Harold promised would be there. They dusted it off and carried it upstairs to open it in the dining room. The dining room table was big enough to accommodate whatever contents they would find in the old chest. At first glance, the contents of the trunk appeared to be insignificant. There were a couple of World War II era newspapers and a Life magazine with Eisenhower (then General Eisenhower) on the cover. There were a few old love letters Mom had saved which Harold had written to her in the thirties. There were a couple of prescription medicine pill bottles dated October, 1946 and a few pieces of cheap costume jewelry. And that was all, except for an envelope with a letter inside. It was addressed to Harold Boyles and postmarked August 25, 1969. Dennis opened the letter and read it aloud: Harold; You have a sick child. I know which one of them poisoned Ethel. I saw the poison being placed in the bottle of salad dressing she used. However, $10,000 will make this memory go away. Roscoe The five sat around the table in silence. If this letter from forty years ago was true, one of them was a murderer. Their Aunt Ethel died in 1968 from what was believed acute food poisoning. Uncle Roscoe had never remarried and they wondered if this was a letter from an embittered, heartbroken man. Still, it was not an accusation they could ignore. Dennis said, “I’m seventy years old and Patricia is the youngest at fifty-eight. Any of us could have murdered Aunt Ethel, if that is indeed what happened.” They continued to sit in stunned silence. Dennis said, “I remember when Auntie got sick. It was at the July Fourth pool party we had here. I thought it was odd that nobody else was affected, but we were later told that she was the only one who used salad dressing from the bottle that was spoiled. I recall now it was her special brand that nobody else liked. If what Uncle Roscoe claims is true, one of us had to have placed poison in the bottle in the kitchen before Mom took the food outside to the pool deck. There was no way to do it outside unnoticed.” George added, softly, “I remember that Aunt Ethel was not a nice person. She always scowled and lost her temper with us when Mom and Dad were not around.” “You saying one of us paid her back?” asked John, incredulously. “Could be.” Patrick, age sixty-eight, said, “Dad would not have kept this letter and pointed us to it if there was nothing to the accusation.” Patricia (Trish, as her brothers called her) said, “You know we can never rest until we figure this out.” She shuddered. “If true, this is terrible.” George, age sixty-five and recently retired, said, “I was the first to arrive that day. Remember, it was a cookout and swim party. I’ve always loved the pool and wanted to get here early for a private swim. The first thing I did when I got here was wave hello to Mom through the window in the kitchen. I saw Dad was with her. Then, after diving into the pool, I gashed my finger on the intake grill and spent the rest of the day with a bandage on my hand.” Patrick spoke next. “I arrived with my wife and our little Alice. George was already bandaged and not looking too happy. First we went to the kitchen to say hi to Mom and Dad. Mom was preparing the condiment tray. The spoiled bottle of dressing was with the other condiments, but it was sealed with the top screwed on.” Trish said, “I remember coming in through the backyard gate. I do recall seeing the condiment tray through the kitchen window—unattended on the kitchen table. Now, I did not go into the kitchen at any time that day. All of you should remember that as I was never by myself all day long. But, while I was looking in the window, Roscoe and Ethel walked up behind me and said hi. I turned around to greet them. I would bet that Roscoe saw somebody handle the salad dressing and later put two and two together.” John, sixty-one, and the quietest of the siblings, spoke next. “I was frying hamburgers outside. Roscoe and Ethel came over to me when they arrived and we visited for awhile. After a time, they went over to the pool area and I saw them speaking with Trish. I would agree that was probably when Roscoe saw something in the kitchen, because he was facing the window and, soon after that, the burgers were done so Mom brought the tray outside.” Dennis was the last to speak. He waited for a few long moments, collecting his memories from forty years ago. Finally, he said, “Well, my family and I arrived pretty much unnoticed, coming in through the back gate as Trish did and walking in just as Roscoe and Aunt Ethel were speaking with her. I noticed Alice getting ready to jump into the pool and Patrick’s wife was taking a seat by the pool. I knew she could not swim so I jumped in to play with Alice. We stayed in the pool until it was time to eat.” The next voice spoke quickly. Looking at the guilty sibling, the voice said, “I know you did this. Would you like to tell the rest of us why?",

      "answer": "(e) Patrick Boyles",
      "outcome": "The accused was not nervous. With great calm, the murderer said, “You better explain yourself.”\n“Oh, I will,” John said. First, I know that George was not in the kitchen before injuring his hand. After that, a heavy bandage would have kept him from quickly opening a lidded bottle. I also know that Trish couldn’t have done it because she was never in the kitchen and we are all witness to it. It wasn’t me and Roscoe knew it, because I was outside when he saw the bottle tampering from outside the kitchen window. The same is true of George because he was just arriving as Trish and our aunt and uncle visited by the window.” John paused, hurt and shock evident in his shaking voice, before continuing, “So, Patrick, it had to be you. Your wife and daughter were outside when you were in the kitchen. I can only guess that you sent Mom and Dad to another part of the house for some made-up reason so you would be alone for a few minutes. You did not count on being seen.”\nAnger rose in Patrick’s voice as he said, “That’s all a wonderful story little brother, but its pretty flimsy, don’t you agree?”\n“Yes, I agree,” John replied.\n“So what is your problem?” The rest of them were startled and wary of their brother. Patrick was showing them a side of himself which they had never seen.\nEvenly, John replied, “The problem is: how did you know the bottle of dressing was sealed with the top screwed on?\nDeathly, ghastly quiet enveloped the dining room where the family had enjoyed so many meals and good times. It seemed to Trish that her brother aged twenty years in the space of a few minutes. Patrick told them in a voice so low as to be barely heard, “She caught me stealing money from her purse once. She beat me until I was bruised all over and made me tell Mom that I was in a fight at school. I swore revenge.”\nDennis wondered if their father had paid Roscoe the ten thousand dollars. Patrick said, “Yeah, he did. But I guess he wanted me to finally own up to it to the rest of you.” A moment later, he added, “I am sorry for Dad. He must have figured out it was me the same way you all did. He bore this burden for too long. Roscoe was no saint, either. I guess our family has had some bad apples. I hope you will forgive me. I know I need some help.”\nFor the first time since they were small children, the Boyles children held hands and prayed. It was a small but significant first step in healing family wounds going back over forty years.\nLater, they would all wonder if that was their father’s dying wish."
