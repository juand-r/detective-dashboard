    "full_text": "The Deer Valley Rock Art Center is a repository of art and history, preserving ancient petroglyphs and pictographs for the modern world to study and enjoy. Maintained as a part of Arizona State University, it is ideally situated near caches of desert rock, upon which natives could leave their mark in the clay-coated surfaces. The meaning of this art will forever be uncertain, as the artists died long before any art critics had the chance to ask. Since the artists are long gone, their work is priceless, valuable beyond any dollar measure. Sadly, such value can lead to problems as well. Dr. Welsh could barely contain himself. First, someone had delivered, practically to his doorstep, the most astounding piece of art ever, and now, not a week later, it had been stolen. It was intolerable. How could anyone stoop so low as to steal this prize of humanity, this “Stona Lisa” of petroglyphs? Only money could drive a person to act so fiendishly, he reasoned. Disgusted, he shook his head and waited. Sure enough, his four research students showed up for their Monday morning assignments, right on time. Three of them made it on time, anyway. Denise showed up five minutes late, her leg in a cast. Dr. Welsh was too preoccupied to notice, so she didn’t get the usual lecture on punctuality. Dr. Welsh knew that one of these four was the culprit. His other staff all had perfect alibis, and the evidence pointed clearly to an inside job. The alarm had been deactivated Sunday, at 11:03 a.m., and reactivated just three minutes later. The thief had known the codes and known exactly where to find their prize quickly – back in the preservation lab. So far, no one had informed the students of the theft. He decided to keep it that way, for the moment. Only the thief would know. Aside from the time of the theft, Dr. Welsh had only one other clue to work with. A trail of sand had fallen from the thief’s pants or shoes as he or she walked through the building. In Arizona, such a thing wouldn’t be unusual, but a quick lab test had shown that the sand didn’t match the local sand – it had a different composition, and came from somewhere else. The students had just had a three-day weekend, so the culprit had probably gotten sandy while on vacation somewhere. It was time to begin. Dr. Welsh took a deep breath to compose himself, and went to greet his students. “Welcome back everyone. I trust you all had a relaxing weekend.” Skye Smith piped up immediately. “It was good, but not as nice as being here.” Juan Carde snorted at her. “Are you kidding? Anything is more relaxing than work.” When Dr. Welsh raised an eyebrow, Juan hurried to adjust his wording. “But working here is still better than other places, I mean.” “Oh, would you two stop sucking up so we can get our assignments?” Denise wasn’t in the mood to be patient. “I want to go sit down already.” Denise was usually such a sweet girl that she caught Dr. Welsh’s attention. “My apologies Denise, I hadn’t noticed your leg before now.” He waved them all into the lobby, where chairs were plentiful. “There’s no rush to get to work on a Monday, but we can certainly talk sitting down.” Once they were seated, Dr. Welsh knew what he wanted to ask everyone, and had the perfect place to start. “However did you manage to break your leg this weekend?” Denise grimaced, either in pain or embarrassment; it was difficult to tell which. “I thought it would be a good idea to hit the slopes up in Aspen, Colorado. About the time I tumbled down the mountainside Saturday morning, I started to rethink that idea.” Dr. Welsh needed a little more information. “How did you manage to get home with that leg?” “After they had me patched up, they contacted my parents for me. They came and drove me home after I was released from the hospital Sunday afternoon. They said that next year I should just take them along so that they could enjoy the skiing part too. That’s sympathy for you.” Dr. Welsh nodded thoughtfully. “What about you Mr. Gaigon? You’ve been awfully quiet this morning.” Jim quickly looked up from the floor. (Had he been avoiding Dr. Welsh’s eyes, or sneaking a nap?) “I’m sorry professor; I didn’t – YAWN – sleep much last night. I spent the weekend in Roswell, New Mexico, visiting the International UFO Museum and Research Center. I came back late yesterday afternoon, but I tell you, that desert sun coming west was murder on my eyes. I kept dreaming about bright spots and aliens all night long. It was creepy.” Juan scoffed at his story. “UFO’s, ha! You think the sun was bad on your drive? Coming back from Long Beach, California yesterday afternoon was just as bright, and I hate driving into the sun. Oh, but a weekend in the surf was well worth it.” Dr. Welsh looked surprised. “Why Juan, I didn’t know you were a surfer.” Now it was Juan’s turn to look a bit embarrassed. “Well, I’m not much of one yet, I’m still learning. When I say I spent my time in the surf, I mean exactly that. I kept falling off my board. I think the people were calling me ‘Can’t-Stay-On Juan’ by the time I left.” That got a chuckle out of Dr. Welsh, despite his usually professional demeanor, and despite all that was on his mind. “We’ll promise to let you be just plain Juan here, never fear. What about you Skye, how was your vacation? You look a bit tanned.” “And well I should,” answered Skye, flipping back her long brown hair. I flew down to Cozumel, Mexico for some scuba diving with the fishes. I’ll bet you didn’t know that I scuba either.” “Well actually...” began Dr. Welsh, but Skye went on after inhaling. “It was beautiful, just like always, with the sparkling water and the beautiful fish, and so much to see, and the perfect sun for tanning. Oh, I could have stayed forever, except that I would never do that to you. Even so, I almost didn’t make it back. My plane was delayed, and delayed again, and it didn’t get back here until one this morning. But I’m still not as sleepy as Jim. I slept on the plane. I always say – get your sleep when there’s nothing to do, or else you’ll miss it when there is.” She glared over at her snoozing colleague. “Okay Jim, you can wake up now, I’m done.” Jim yawned and stretched. “I feel much better now,” he managed. “That’s good Jim,” began Dr. Welsh, “because I have some important news for you all.” They all perked up, attentive to what he would say. “Yesterday morning, someone stole the ‘Stona Lisa’ we received last week.” Four gasps caused him to pause. “Worse, the theft was by one of our own – one of you four, and I’m afraid that I now know who that person is. You all have alibis, but the guilty person is lying. Please don’t do anything silly, a police officer is patiently waiting in the next room.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. TIME OF THE CRIME  \n   • Alarm off Sunday 11:03 a.m., on again 11:06 a.m.  \n   • Thief had to be in Phoenix at that moment and had to know the codes.  \n   • Therefore the alibi each student gives for late-Sunday morning is the key.\n\n2. SAND CLUE  \n   • Laboratory said the trail of sand “didn’t match the local sand.”  \n   • Phoenix sand is dry desert silt; anything with a high shell/sea-salt or coral content would immediately look “non-local.”  \n   • Beach sand (Long Beach) or coral sand (Cozumel) would stand out.  \n   • New-Mexico desert sand, on the other hand, is geologically similar to Arizona’s and probably would not have been flagged as “different.”\n\n3. CHECKING EACH STORY  \n\n   Denise (Aspen, Colorado)  \n   – Broken leg Saturday morning, in hospital until Sunday afternoon.  \n   – 600-mile drive to Phoenix starts only after release.  \n   – Physically and geographically impossible to be at the center 11 a.m. Sunday.  \n   – Sand from a snow-covered ski slope is unlikely.\n\n   Jim Gaigon (Roswell, New Mexico)  \n   – Roswell is east of Phoenix.  \n   – Driving home westward in the afternoon means the sun would indeed be “murder on his eyes.”  \n   – Story internally consistent.  \n   – Roswell desert sand ≈ Arizona desert sand → would probably NOT be tagged “non-local.”\n\n   Skye Smith (Cozumel, Mexico)  \n   – Plane finally landed 1 a.m. Monday; at 11 a.m. Sunday she was still in Mexico or in the air.  \n   – Could not be at the museum.  \n   – Although Cozumel sand would be “non-local,” she simply wasn’t in Arizona.\n\n   Juan Carde (Long Beach, California)  \n   – Phoenix lies east of Long Beach. Anyone driving home Sunday afternoon would be travelling EAST, with the setting sun BEHIND him, not “into” it.  \n   – His complaint about “driving into the sun” is impossible for that route and time and therefore a lie.  \n   – A pre-dawn departure from Long Beach (around 4 a.m.) would put him in Phoenix before 11 a.m.; he could steal the petroglyph at 11:03, re-arm the alarm at 11:06, and still arrive home “yesterday afternoon” as he claimed.  \n   – After a weekend of falling off his surfboard he would certainly have Long Beach’s shell-rich sand in his cuffs and shoes, exactly the kind the lab tagged as “different.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDenise (last name not given), Jim Gaigon, Juan Carde, Skye Smith\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJuan Carde\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nJuan spent Friday and Saturday trying to surf at Long Beach.  \nEarly Sunday, while it was still dark, he tossed his sand-covered clothes into his car, left California about 4 a.m., and headed for Phoenix.  \nHe reached the Deer Valley Rock Art Center a little before 11 a.m. Because he is a research assistant he knows both the building layout and the alarm code.  \nAt 11:03 a.m. he keyed the system off, hurried straight to the preservation lab, removed the priceless “Stona Lisa,” slipped it into a padded surfboard bag in his trunk, and re-armed the alarm at 11:06 a.m.  \nThe shell-rich Long Beach sand that clung to his shoes formed the tell-tale trail through the hallways.  \nJuan then drove to his apartment, arriving “yesterday afternoon,” and invented an innocuous story about a bright eastward drive to mask the fact that he had actually travelled west-to-east long before the afternoon sun was a factor.  \nOn Monday morning he repeated that story, not realising the sun-direction blunder would betray him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Denise: Hospital records and her parents’ testimony confirm she was in an Aspen ward until Sunday afternoon; a freshly set leg in a cast makes a stealthy three-minute burglary impossible.  \n• Jim: His westward afternoon drive matches geography; Roswell sand is geologically similar to Phoenix sand, so no “different” sand would have appeared.  \n• Skye: Airline records put her in the air or still in Mexico throughout Sunday; she could not physically be in Phoenix at 11 a.m.  \nOnly Juan’s story conflicts with geography, matches the sand evidence, and leaves him free at exactly the right moment. Therefore he—and only he—is the thief.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

That’s sympathy for you.” Dr. Welsh nodded thoughtfully. “What about you Mr. Gaigon? You’ve been awfully quiet this morning.” Jim quickly looked up from the floor. (Had he been avoiding Dr. Welsh’s eyes, or sneaking a nap?) “I’m sorry professor; I didn’t – YAWN – sleep much last night. I spent the weekend in Roswell, New Mexico, visiting the International UFO Museum and Research Center. I came back late yesterday afternoon, but I tell you, that desert sun coming west was murder on my eyes. I kept dreaming about bright spots and aliens all night long. It was creepy.” Juan scoffed at his story. “UFO’s, ha! You think the sun was bad on your drive? Coming back from Long Beach, California yesterday afternoon was just as bright, and I hate driving into the sun. Oh, but a weekend in the surf was well worth it.” Dr. Welsh looked surprised. “Why Juan, I didn’t know you were a surfer.” Now it was Juan’s turn to look a bit embarrassed. “Well, I’m not much of one yet, I’m still learning. When I say I spent my time in the surf, I mean exactly that. I kept falling off my board. I think the people were calling me ‘Can’t-Stay-On Juan’ by the time I left.” That got a chuckle out of Dr. Welsh, despite his usually professional demeanor, and despite all that was on his mind. “We’ll promise to let you be just plain Juan here, never fear. What about you Skye, how was your vacation? You look a bit tanned.” “And well I should,” answered Skye, flipping back her long brown hair. I flew down to Cozumel, Mexico for some scuba diving with the fishes. I’ll bet you didn’t know that I scuba either.” “Well actually...” began Dr. Welsh, but Skye went on after inhaling. “It was beautiful, just like always, with the sparkling water and the beautiful fish, and so much to see, and the perfect sun for tanning. Oh, I could have stayed forever, except that I would never do that to you. Even so, I almost didn’t make it back. My plane was delayed, and delayed again, and it didn’t get back here until one this morning. But I’m still not as sleepy as Jim. I slept on the plane. I always say – get your sleep when there’s nothing to do, or else you’ll miss it when there is.” She glared over at her snoozing colleague. “Okay Jim, you can wake up now, I’m done.” Jim yawned and stretched. “I feel much better now,” he managed. “That’s good Jim,” began Dr. Welsh, “because I have some important news for you all.” They all perked up, attentive to what he would say. “Yesterday morning, someone stole the ‘Stona Lisa’ we received last week.” Four gasps caused him to pause. “Worse, the theft was by one of our own – one of you four, and I’m afraid that I now know who that person is. You all have alibis, but the guilty person is lying. Please don’t do anything silly, a police officer is patiently waiting in the next room.”",

      "answer": "(c) Juan Carde",
      "outcome": "Dr. Welsh continued: “Denise was still in the hospital on Sunday morning, so she couldn’t have stolen it. Skye’s plane didn’t arrive until late Sunday night, so it wasn’t her. Jim obviously drove home late in the day on Sunday as he was heading west and the sun was in his eyes. Thus, he’s not the culprit.\n“I’m sorry Juan, but you tripped yourself up with too much information. You drove home into the sun, like Jim did, but you were coming east on your way home. That means you drove home in the morning, not the afternoon, and so not only were you here, but you also felt it necessary to cover it up. Only the guilty person would have needed to do that.”\n“Officer, please take this young man away.”"
