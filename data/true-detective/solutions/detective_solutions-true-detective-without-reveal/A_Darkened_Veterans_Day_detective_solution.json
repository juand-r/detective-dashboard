    "full_text": "They stood in a circle—their eyes darting around wildly in their sockets, briefly meeting to exchange uneasy glares. The intensity in the air was so thick it could be cut with a knife. Everyone who had come to the celebration (or had some involvement in it) had been called to the City Hall’s main room, where they all stood growing into cynics as each person sized up the others in the room. It certainly wasn’t the most comfortable moment in the world, and it got only more stressful when a police officer strode into the City Hall, breaking the silence. “Now what’s the trouble here?” By the look of him, he wasn’t pleased to be there. The question hung in the air for a long time before someone finally answered. “There was a theft here, sir,” said Frank Thompson, who had been hanging outside the circle of celebrators. He was the head custodian and overall caretaker of the City Hall, and had a very haggard appearance; his gray jumpsuit was patched in several places, and the key chain at his side, heavily burdened with keys, was rusted. The police officer grunted, displeased at such a vague response. “Give me specifics, sir.” “Someone stole the Veterans’ pins,” broke in Mr. Landry, the son of one of the veterans. His father, who had served since before Vietnam even, had grown too old to speak up for himself and quietly sat in his chair barely looking perturbed. The officer blinked, surprised. “What pins?” The veteran’s son gave a brief description of the pins: they were pure gold, decorative pins that were given out every year at the town’s Veterans Day celebration. Except this year, according to Mr. Landry, they were especially important, because they not only highlighted the services of the veterans (which they always did), but they also celebrated the town’s tenth successful Veterans Day celebration. In the past, the small town had been without the funds to throw such events. But beginning a decade ago, they started doing better financially, and the party seemed more extravagant every year. “Why would someone want to steal the pins?” asked the officer, eying the empty box that he presumed had once contained the ceremonial objects. “I assume they’d be worth a significant sum,” answered Colonel Abraham in a curt tone. Colonel Abraham, a well-known member of the community, had also served in Vietnam. He was among the minority who actually enlisted in the army rather than being drafted. He was a very strong looking man, even in his old age, and he had never seemed to be very nice. There was always a scowl sewn onto his face. “Probably,” agreed the officer, who had stepped through the crowd to examine the box more closely. It was a simple cardboard box, with no corporate insignia on the outside. “Who was the one who brought the box?” he asked. A small, timid delivery boy stepped forward. He shivered as he looked up into the officer’s eyes. “That would be me, s-sir,” he stuttered. “I reckon it was that boy who took ’em,” spat the colonel, glaring at the delivery boy. “He was the first person to be in contact with them. Selfish punk trying to earn a quick buck, huh?” “N-no! It wasn’t me, I s-swear!” he answered. “Quiet, kid,” said the officer bluntly. “Well what about the Landry boy?” yelled the custodian, key chain jangling. “I bet because of how highly he thinks of his daddy, he stole the pins to give them all to him!” “I would never do that,” Mr. Landry responded. “My father would rather not be given a pin, I have to talk him into coming to this celebration every year. You probably had one of the best opportunities to steal the pins, Frank. Or maybe it was you, Colonel?” He turned to the rugged veteran, cheeks red. “We all know about how highly you think of yourself and your services; who’s to say you didn’t do it?” The Colonel, who had grabbed the delivery boy out of anger while Landry spoke, opened his mouth to speak before he was interrupted by the police officer. “Enough. All of you go into the other room until I call you back in. I’d like to speak to the Colonel, the delivery boy (“Ryan Smith,” the boy muttered, feeling resentment when his name was not acknowledged), Mr. Landry and Frank Thompson right now. Gentlemen, please remain here with me.” When everyone else had scurried out of the room, the police officer took a deep breath. Before he addressed the men, he noticed a plug of tobacco near the cardboard box. He picked it up and pocketed it. “So earlier today, Ryan Smith here, the delivery boy, brought the box of pins to City Hall to be handed out to the veterans. Is this correct?” Ryan, along with Mr. Landry, nodded. “What happened to the box once it arrived here at City Hall?” asked the officer. “We opened it to check that the engraving on the pins was correct, and then we went to lock them up,” answered Mr. Landry. “Only the custodian has the key to that room.” The officer asked, “So the missing pins were locked away, until ...?” “Until I was sent to get them,” finished Colonel Abraham, whose statement was punctuated by the sound of the custodian spitting chewed tobacco into a nearby cup. “Did you get the key from the custodian?” asked the officer. “Yes,” he answered. “And when I unlocked the room, the box was empty.” The police officer grimaced when the custodian spat more chewed tobacco into a cup. “Will you stop that, sir? It’s disgusting. Not to mention very unhealthy, you know.” “Sorry sir, the Colonel here got me into the habit. I don’t normally chew, all I have is what’s in my mouth, which the Colonel gave me a little earlier,” the custodian said, slightly digressing. Struck by a sudden revelation, the police officer smirked. “I think I know who did it.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Clarify the time-line  \n   •  The delivery boy (Ryan Smith) brings the box.  \n   •  Mr. Landry opens it, sees the pins, then he and the others have it locked in a storeroom.  \n   •  Only one key exists and it hangs on Frank Thompson’s (the custodian’s) chain.  \n   •  Just before the ceremony someone sends Colonel Abraham to fetch the pins; Frank hands him the key.  \n   •  The Colonel goes to the locked room alone, unlocks it, and comes back claiming the box is empty.  \n   ⇒  Between “box locked” and “Colonel returns” only TWO men could have touched the box: Frank (while he still had the key) and the Colonel (after he borrowed it).\n\n2.  Look at the physical clue the author bothers to highlight  \n   •  The policeman finds an un-chewed “plug of tobacco” lying on the floor by the box. He pockets it.  \n   •  A little later he sees Frank spitting out chewing tobacco and rebukes him.  \n   •  Frank says: “The Colonel here got me into the habit. I don’t normally chew; all I have is what’s in my mouth, which the Colonel gave me a little earlier.”  \n   •  Translation: Frank possesses only a small wad. The loose, whole plug on the floor therefore cannot be his—he never had one to drop. It must have belonged to the Colonel, the habitual chewer who had a full plug to bite pieces from.\n\n3.  Match the clue to opportunity  \n   •  The plug is direct evidence that whoever was in the storeroom had it in his pocket and accidentally dropped it.  \n   •  The only person in that storeroom after the box was locked (other than the thief) is the Colonel himself.  \n   •  Therefore the presence of the Colonel’s tobacco in the room ties him— and no one else— to the theft.\n\n4.  Motive  \n   •  Pure gold pins are valuable.  \n   •  The Colonel’s personality in the story—prideful, scowling, quick to accuse others— fits someone who might feel “entitled” to take the pins or be tempted by the money they would bring.\n\n5.  Eliminate the others  \n   •  Delivery boy: pins were still present when Mr. Landry inspected them, so Ryan could not have taken them.  \n   •  Mr. Landry: he had no key and no chance to enter the storeroom.  \n   •  Frank (custodian): he did have the key, but the major physical clue (the Colonel’s tobacco plug) appears during the later visit, not at the locking stage, and Frank did not possess an entire plug to drop.\n\n   Taken together, the plug of tobacco + sole access to the locked room at the critical moment points unambiguously to Colonel Abraham.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nColonel Abraham, Frank Thompson, Ryan Smith, Mr. Landry\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nColonel Abraham\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1.  Ryan Smith delivers the pins; Mr. Landry verifies the engraving.  \n2.  Frank Thompson locks the pins in the storeroom and resumes his duties.  \n3.  A short while later the committee asks Colonel Abraham to fetch the box for the presentation.  \n4.  Frank hands the key to the Colonel. Alone in the storeroom, the Colonel opens the box, pockets the gold pins, and hurriedly stuffs his plug of chewing tobacco back into his pocket—but it falls to the floor beside the box.  \n5.  He relocks the door, returns the key and proclaims that the box is already empty, launching the alarm that summons the police.  \n6.  The policeman finds the dropped tobacco plug, later learns that Frank possesses only a small borrowed wad, and realizes the plug could have belonged only to the habitual chewer, Colonel Abraham.  \n7.  Confronted with that fact and his exclusive opportunity, the Colonel is identified as the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Ryan Smith (delivery boy): The pins were seen and verified after he left the box; he had no access to the storeroom afterward.  \n•  Mr. Landry: He never possessed the key and had no means of entering the locked room.  \n•  Frank Thompson (custodian): Although he owned the key, the fresh, un-chewed plug on the floor could not be his—he had only a small piece in his mouth that the Colonel had given him. Without a full plug to drop, and with no other evidence linking him to the scene after the door was locked, he is cleared.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
