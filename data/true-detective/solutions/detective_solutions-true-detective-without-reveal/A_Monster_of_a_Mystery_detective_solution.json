    "full_text": "Five monsters stood at the cemetery gates, hesitant to enter. “Aren’t monsters supposed to love cemeteries?” I asked, looking around at the witch, the vampire, the werewolf and the mummy that accompanied me (I’m a ghost). “I don’t think real monsters would be afraid to go in.” A full moon glowed in the sky, casting shadows from the trees spookily over the graves. To be honest, I was terrified, but this is how teenagers are supposed to spend Halloween night, right? “I’m not afraid,” Donald the vampire said. “Like I told you yesterday,” my best friend, Randy the werewolf, told me, “on Halloween night, the real monsters come out to play. That’s why we’re wearing these costumes, so the monsters will think we’re one of their kind and leave us alone.” “And the place most of the monsters come from is cemeteries,” Donald added. “Walking through this cemetery will prove we’re not afraid of monsters. It’ll separate the men from the boys.” “Ahem,” Linda the witch cut in, “it’ll separate the grown-ups from the children.” Everyone groaned -- even Wendell the mummy, who’d only known Linda for a week. Wendell was new to the neighborhood, having recently moved in next door to Linda, and this was his first time in the local cemetery, night or day. But he didn’t have to know her for long to react with the same groan as the rest of us -- she was always reminding us that girls could do the same things boys can do, often better. “My cousin saw a werewolf on the last full moon,” Randy said. “He said it was huge!” “Maybe your cousin saw an actual wolf,” I suggested.” “No way,” Randy said. “It was walking upright, like me.” He raised his hairy arms up menacingly and howled at the moon to get his point across. “We’re more likely to run into a vampire tonight,” Donald said. “So beware if you see a man-sized hole in a grave, because it means a vampire crawled out of there!” “Or that a zombie clawed its way out,” Linda added. “There’s only one way to find out,” Randy said. Everyone agreed -- we had to steady our nerves and just walk in. So we did. We loudly joked that if any monsters got in our way, they’d have to give us candy for the right to stay in our cemetery. Soon we came upon a big old crypt. The crypt’s door was open and Linda dared us to go inside. It was dark inside the windowless tomb, and the old rock looked like it could crumble and collapse at any time ... but no one would admit to being scared. “Okay, let’s do it,” Wendell said. “Maybe the coffins in there will have other mummies like me!” Donald entered the crypt first. Being the tallest of the group, he had to duck a bit to get through the doorway, his Dracula-style cape fluttering behind him. “Or maybe,” he said over his shoulder, flashing his pointy white fangs, “the coffins will all be empty because vampires don’t sleep at night!” We’d soon discover that something other than mummies and vampires had lured us into a trap ... The moment we were all inside the crypt, the creaking door slammed shut behind us. We were instantly thrown into pitch blackness, so I couldn’t tell who -- or what -- had closed the door. Wendell screamed. I somehow managed not to. “Anyone have a flashlight?” I asked. “I do,” Linda said. “But I can’t find it.” There came a muffled thump, Randy cried out, then I heard what sounded like the shells of countless cockroaches skittering across the floor. “Nobody move,” Randy said. “I tripped and spilled all my candy. And I don’t care if you’re one of my friends or the boogeyman, you can’t have any of my candy!” We’d been to dozens of houses, so that was a lot of candy for Randy to pick up in the dark. As we stood there waiting for Randy to finish picking up his treats, I heard a rock scraping against another rock. It had to be the heavy concrete lid of one of the vaults! For several minutes, I stood still, listening for monsters. I shivered when I heard something moving outside. Then I thought I heard something sneaking up on us from the direction of the concrete vault. So I was relieved when Linda finally broke the silence. And the darkness. “I found it!” she exclaimed. Linda turned her flashlight on and shone it around. She pointed the light right in Wendell’s eyes and his pupils contracted in protest before he had a chance to put his hand up to shield his eyes. “Hey, watch where you’re pointing that thing,” he said. Linda swung the flashlight onto Randy, who was just picking up the last piece of his spilled candy. He looked around the floor and smiled when he saw no stray suckers or chocolate bars. “I did pretty good finding everything in the dark,” Randy said. I couldn’t stop thinking about what could be in there with us, creeping up on us at that very second. I pointed in the direction I’d heard the vault lid sliding off. “Shine the light over there,” I said. Linda obliged and I was startled to discover a hole in the crypt wall. Two large concrete bricks had been pulled out. That’s the sound I’d heard. “With our costumes we must look pretty horrifying,” Randy said, “because we scared some monster enough that it tore through the wall to get away from us.” “Well, there could be other things in here,” Donald said, as he headed for the hole. “So I’m getting out of here, too.” But when Donald got to the hole in the crypt wall, it was obvious he couldn’t fit through it. “Someone else will have to go through and open the front door.” Wendell was much smaller than Donald and he was quite eager to get out. But the moment he stepped outside, he screamed. We heard him run around to the front of the crypt, but for all we knew he was being chased by a werewolf. Then he screamed again. Suddenly, Wendell yanked the crypt door open with all his might. He stood there shaking. “Zuh-zuh-zombies!” he cried. Donald pushed past him, then shrieked in terror. My curiosity momentarily overtook my fear and I hurried out to see what was going on. At the nearest gravesite, a ghoulish head and shoulders had broken through the earth, along with two decaying arms. And at the grave next to it, a female zombie had pulled half her body out of the ground. “Everybody run!” I shouted. Not thinking, I turned and ran past the crypt, coming close to where the hole in the wall was -- where Wendell had first seen something that had made him scream. And there was another top half of a zombie! Only, instead of making me run faster, seeing this caused me to stop and stare. It was the exact same zombie in the exact same position as the one I’d seen at the front of the crypt. Even in my terrified state, my mind was able to process that fact. My friends stumbled to a stop around me. “Why are you stopping?” Linda asked. “Let’s go!” “Hand me your flashlight,” I said. With the added illumination, I came to a certain conclusion. “The zombies are fake! Look, this one’s not moving.” “Zombies are slow, lumbering monsters,” Randy said. “Don’t you watch the movies?” “Yeah,” Donald said, not taking his eyes off the zombie in the ground, “they just keep coming until you make a mistake, and then they eat your brains!” “No mistake,” I said. I walked over and yanked the monster off the ground. It didn’t protest. There was nothing beneath the top half that we’d seen. It didn’t feel like rotting flesh, and a closer inspection revealed it to be foam-filled latex. “One of you played a Halloween ‘trick’ on us, but I should get the ‘treat’ because I figured out who did it.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. The zombies, the loose bricks in the wall and the slamming door could only have been prepared well before the five youngsters arrived.  \n   – That rules out any spur-of-the-moment trick done after they were already inside the crypt.  \n2. Somebody had to guide the group to the crypt, make sure everybody went inside, then keep them motionless in total darkness long enough for the scare to “ripen.”  \n   – Inside the crypt the only person who actually gave an order that froze everybody in place was Randy: “Nobody move … I spilled all my candy.”  \n3. “Spilling” a whole night’s haul (scores of pieces) and then finding it all again, in pitch blackness, in barely two or three minutes, is practically impossible.  \n   – Therefore Randy didn’t really spend those minutes picking up sweets; he was using the darkness (and his order that no one move) to do something else.  \n4. While everyone stood still the narrator heard a rock scraping on rock – the sound of the two loosened bricks being shoved out of the wall.  \n   – The only one who had freedom to move during that interval was Randy, because he had told the rest of them to stay put.  \n5. The hole in the wall is small – big enough for Wendell but far too tight for tall Donald.  It makes sense if the culprit is of Randy’s medium build and dug it so that at least one other person (Wendell) would be able to crawl out and open the door, ending the prank at a moment the culprit could predict.  \n6. Motive: Randy was the one boasting all evening about werewolves, “separating the men from the boys,” and proving their courage.  A spectacular cemetery scare would let him boast that he’d faced “real” monsters while everybody else panicked.  \n7. Opportunity and access: Randy is a long-time local (unlike newcomer Wendell) and could easily have visited the cemetery earlier that day to bury three identical foam-latex “half-zombies,” loosen two bricks in the crypt wall and rig the heavy door so a light pull would slam it shut.  \n8. Physical evidence against the others:  \n   – Linda was busy “searching” for her flashlight and never moved from her spot until she turned it on.  \n   – Donald’s height made it impossible for him to pass through the small hole, so he would have given himself no practical escape if he had planned the trick.  \n   – Wendell had never been in the cemetery before and was visibly shaken; the narrator even noticed his wide, fully-dilated pupils when the light hit him – exactly what one would expect of someone who had just spent ten minutes in total darkness, not someone who had been working outside with a flashlight minutes earlier.\n\nPutting those facts together the only person with motive, opportunity and the necessary freedom of movement inside the crypt is Randy.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDonald, Randy, Linda, Wendell\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nRandy “the Werewolf”  (surname not given)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarlier on Halloween afternoon Randy sneaked into the cemetery with three store-bought, foam-filled “half-zombie” props.  \n• He buried two of them in shallow scoops of earth beside the crypt’s entrance and pushed the third into the soft ground next to the crypt’s rear wall.  \n• Inside the crypt he pried two loose bricks almost all the way out, leaving them wedged so a single shove from inside would finish the job and create a crawl-hole.  \n• He also made sure the old iron door would slam shut with a tug (or a short length of thread he could yank loose).\n\nThat night he urged his friends to prove their bravery by entering the crypt.  Randy manoeuvred himself so that he was last but one to step inside, gave the door the intended pull and let it bang closed.  \n\nIn the pitch dark he pretended to trip and “spill” his candy.  Ordering everybody to stand still kept them frozen while he quietly crossed to the wall and pushed the two bricks the rest of the way out – the “rock scraping” sound the narrator heard.  \n\nOnce Linda produced light, Randy was safely back on his knees “finishing” the candy pickup.  He now had his escape hole ready.  Predictably the smallest member, Wendell, crawled through it, discovered the planted zombies and began screaming – triggering the full scare Randy had planned.  \n\nThe group bolted outside, saw more identical “corpses” and panicked just as Randy had hoped.  Unfortunately for him, the narrator noticed that the two zombies were perfect twins and obviously rubber props.  The game was up.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Donald: First to enter, far too tall to fit the crawl-hole, and would have trapped himself if he had set up the trick.  \n• Linda: Spent the crucial minutes rummaging for her flashlight; the bricks were already out before her light came on.  She never left the group’s side.  \n• Wendell: A newcomer who had “never been in the cemetery, night or day.”  His genuine panic, dilated pupils and immediate flight all point to innocence.  He was also the victim chosen to crawl through the hole Randy had prepared.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It’ll separate the men from the boys.” “Ahem,” Linda the witch cut in, “it’ll separate the grown-ups from the children.” Everyone groaned -- even Wendell the mummy, who’d only known Linda for a week. Wendell was new to the neighborhood, having recently moved in next door to Linda, and this was his first time in the local cemetery, night or day. But he didn’t have to know her for long to react with the same groan as the rest of us -- she was always reminding us that girls could do the same things boys can do, often better. “My cousin saw a werewolf on the last full moon,” Randy said. “He said it was huge!” “Maybe your cousin saw an actual wolf,” I suggested.” “No way,” Randy said. “It was walking upright, like me.” He raised his hairy arms up menacingly and howled at the moon to get his point across. “We’re more likely to run into a vampire tonight,” Donald said. “So beware if you see a man-sized hole in a grave, because it means a vampire crawled out of there!” “Or that a zombie clawed its way out,” Linda added. “There’s only one way to find out,” Randy said. Everyone agreed -- we had to steady our nerves and just walk in. So we did. We loudly joked that if any monsters got in our way, they’d have to give us candy for the right to stay in our cemetery. Soon we came upon a big old crypt. The crypt’s door was open and Linda dared us to go inside. It was dark inside the windowless tomb, and the old rock looked like it could crumble and collapse at any time ... but no one would admit to being scared. “Okay, let’s do it,” Wendell said. “Maybe the coffins in there will have other mummies like me!” Donald entered the crypt first. Being the tallest of the group, he had to duck a bit to get through the doorway, his Dracula-style cape fluttering behind him. “Or maybe,” he said over his shoulder, flashing his pointy white fangs, “the coffins will all be empty because vampires don’t sleep at night!” We’d soon discover that something other than mummies and vampires had lured us into a trap ... The moment we were all inside the crypt, the creaking door slammed shut behind us. We were instantly thrown into pitch blackness, so I couldn’t tell who -- or what -- had closed the door. Wendell screamed. I somehow managed not to. “Anyone have a flashlight?” I asked. “I do,” Linda said. “But I can’t find it.” There came a muffled thump, Randy cried out, then I heard what sounded like the shells of countless cockroaches skittering across the floor. “Nobody move,” Randy said. “I tripped and spilled all my candy. And I don’t care if you’re one of my friends or the boogeyman, you can’t have any of my candy!” We’d been to dozens of houses, so that was a lot of candy for Randy to pick up in the dark. As we stood there waiting for Randy to finish picking up his treats, I heard a rock scraping against another rock. It had to be the heavy concrete lid of one of the vaults! For several minutes, I stood still, listening for monsters. I shivered when I heard something moving outside. Then I thought I heard something sneaking up on us from the direction of the concrete vault. So I was relieved when Linda finally broke the silence. And the darkness. “I found it!” she exclaimed. Linda turned her flashlight on and shone it around. She pointed the light right in Wendell’s eyes and his pupils contracted in protest before he had a chance to put his hand up to shield his eyes. “Hey, watch where you’re pointing that thing,” he said. Linda swung the flashlight onto Randy, who was just picking up the last piece of his spilled candy. He looked around the floor and smiled when he saw no stray suckers or chocolate bars. “I did pretty good finding everything in the dark,” Randy said. I couldn’t stop thinking about what could be in there with us, creeping up on us at that very second. I pointed in the direction I’d heard the vault lid sliding off. “Shine the light over there,” I said. Linda obliged and I was startled to discover a hole in the crypt wall. Two large concrete bricks had been pulled out. That’s the sound I’d heard. “With our costumes we must look pretty horrifying,” Randy said, “because we scared some monster enough that it tore through the wall to get away from us.” “Well, there could be other things in here,” Donald said, as he headed for the hole. “So I’m getting out of here, too.” But when Donald got to the hole in the crypt wall, it was obvious he couldn’t fit through it. “Someone else will have to go through and open the front door.” Wendell was much smaller than Donald and he was quite eager to get out. But the moment he stepped outside, he screamed. We heard him run around to the front of the crypt, but for all we knew he was being chased by a werewolf. Then he screamed again. Suddenly, Wendell yanked the crypt door open with all his might. He stood there shaking. “Zuh-zuh-zombies!” he cried. Donald pushed past him, then shrieked in terror. My curiosity momentarily overtook my fear and I hurried out to see what was going on. At the nearest gravesite, a ghoulish head and shoulders had broken through the earth, along with two decaying arms. And at the grave next to it, a female zombie had pulled half her body out of the ground. “Everybody run!” I shouted. Not thinking, I turned and ran past the crypt, coming close to where the hole in the wall was -- where Wendell had first seen something that had made him scream. And there was another top half of a zombie! Only, instead of making me run faster, seeing this caused me to stop and stare. It was the exact same zombie in the exact same position as the one I’d seen at the front of the crypt. Even in my terrified state, my mind was able to process that fact. My friends stumbled to a stop around me. “Why are you stopping?” Linda asked. “Let’s go!” “Hand me your flashlight,” I said. With the added illumination, I came to a certain conclusion. “The zombies are fake! Look, this one’s not moving.” “Zombies are slow, lumbering monsters,” Randy said. “Don’t you watch the movies?” “Yeah,” Donald said, not taking his eyes off the zombie in the ground, “they just keep coming until you make a mistake, and then they eat your brains!” “No mistake,” I said. I walked over and yanked the monster off the ground. It didn’t protest. There was nothing beneath the top half that we’d seen. It didn’t feel like rotting flesh, and a closer inspection revealed it to be foam-filled latex. “One of you played a Halloween ‘trick’ on us, but I should get the ‘treat’ because I figured out who did it.”",

      "outcome": "“Maybe Wendell planted the monsters,” said Linda. “His screams were so loud, he had to have been faking it!”\nWendell blushed. He really had sounded terrified. But I pointed out that Wendell couldn’t have staged the prank. “He’d never even been to the cemetery before.”\nLinda then pointed out that Randy was most likely the culprit. “It was Randy’s idea to come here in the first place.”\n“But we all heard Randy spill his bag of candy,” I said. “There’s no way he could’ve picked all that up in the dark and still had time to slip away and plant the fake monsters.”\n“Actually,” Linda said, “it was Donald who was insistent that we walk through here tonight to separate the men from the boys. He was probably trying to prove his point.”\n“But Donald couldn’t even fit through the hole in the wall,” I said. “He couldn’t have left the crypt, other than through the creaking front door.”\nI grinned at our zombie prankster and said, “You were the one who wanted us to go into the crypt.” Everyone else chuckled as they realized who’d tricked them.\nA broad smile spread across Linda’s face. “You should have seen your faces!” she said. “You were so scared.” She chuckled. “I just wanted to prove that it’s not about boys or men, that girls can handle monsters, too.”\n“Point taken,” Donald said. “Now let’s get out of here before the real monsters show up.”"
