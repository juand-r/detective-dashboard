    "full_text": "The arsonist had the town police stumped. It was a series of vicious fires, set to produce a large ransom from the town. Already, several stores in the old Main Street commercial section had been hit. They were on a continuous block of stores on both sides of the street, with a common roof. One of them had burned nearly to the ground. Then there was a particularly vicious episode, when the fire department, distracted by a commercial fire, arrived too late at a residential fire three miles south of the city. The hallmark of that arson, rags soaked in kerosene, was the same as the fires set in the commercial section. Clearly, the arsonist was upping the ante. Clues were hard to come by, and the arsonist had called in a warning to the local radio station, KPKR. Anybody who helped the police would find their house or place of business was the next target. That’s when Inspector Samuels had his bright idea. He called me up. “Crusher,” he said, “why don’t you ask for clues through your column?” It seemed that our previous working together, to solve The Litterer Case, had given me real credibility with his boss, our Chief of Police. I am sure that they were both hearing from the Mayor as well. “Sure, Inspector, I’d be glad to help,” I said. That’s why I put in my advice column, Ask Martha, a request for help, for anyone who had seen or knew anything about the arsonist. People writing in were told to make duplicates of their letters, for identification, and to claim the reward money for the entry that helped the police solve the crime - if there was any help, that is. If you are wondering why a 6 foot 6, 265 pound former all state football player named Crusher Davis is writing the advice column under the name Ask Martha, you haven’t been on the job market lately! All I can say is, the money is all right, and I rather enjoy doling out advice, when there isn’t a football game or City Hall scandal to cover, that is. Fortunately, my identity as Martha was a secret, so my home was safe. Inspector Samuels briefed me on the fires. There was newspaper speculation, but precise details of the arson crimes had not been made public. There had been four so far, all in the current month of March. The first one, which broke out just after midnight on Sunday, March 1, was set in the commercial section on Main Street and did serious damage to Green’s Hardware Store, with smoke damage to adjacent stores. That one remained a mystery, for there were no demands for money or anything of that sort. It was just setting us up, I guess. On March 4, the arsonist struck once again, in the very same block. This time it was Hill’s Drug Store. It was late at night again, but the fire department was revved up for action, and had put an extra crew on the late shift. They were there within minutes of being called, and the fire was put out without much damage, except for some water damage from the sprinkler system. A call came to the police station, from a public phone, offering to stop the fires if a large sum of money was paid. A location was given for the answer to be dropped off, behind a loose brick in the schoolyard wall by the elementary school. The location was well chosen. Anybody there could see clearly in all directions for blocks. The police chose to ignore the call, and the arsonist struck again. This time, he struck twice, on March 11. It was that double arson I was telling you about. A fire was set, once again on Main Street, on the roof of the building that houses the Bradley Men’s Store. Fortunately a passerby saw it and called the fire department on his cell phone. Damage was contained, and the fire department was feeling good about that, when they were called about the residential fire on Sunnydale Drive, outside of town. While the fire department had been occupied with the commercial fire, the house burned to the ground. Fortunately, the family was out of town, and they had even taken their pets to be boarded during their trip. That was when I put the call for help in my Ask Martha column. Sure enough, there were four replies. I read them over carefully. All referenced the reward money that the Main Street Commercial Association was offering for information that led to identifying the arsonist. Inspector Samuels and I hoped that there would be a useful clue in one of those replies. Scared Stiff said that she had been driving along Main Street on March 11, when she had seen the fire break out at Bradley Men’s Store. It was a little after midnight. She could describe the arsonist, who was running out the front door. She said she had gotten a good look at him before he disappeared into a nearby alley. She wanted police protection, though, because he was a burly man, and she was, as she said, Scared Stiff. Watchful Waiter worked across the street from the elementary school, at the snack bar, which was still prospering despite the economic hard times. Kids never seemed to lose their appetites for fudgecicles and popsicles and had a few coins to pay for them. The Snack Shoppe had the sense to break open packages of these treats, so that they were for sale one fudgesicle or popsicle at a time. Looking out his store window a few days previously, Watchful Waiter had seen a woman look both ways, then climb the low schoolyard wall. This was late in the afternoon, after school had let out for the day. He had thought nothing about it, until the action was repeated a few days later. Now, he was wondering if this could have had anything to do with the arsons under investigation. He could describe the woman, and the second time it happened, he had made a note of her car’s license plate number. Keen Observer lived outside of town. He was driving home from a long trip, monitoring the police calls throughout the evening on his car shortwave radio. He listened all the way home, hearing about a residential fire, which bothered him until the address was clearly given. He thought it might be his home. Passing Sunnydale Drive, not far from his own home, he saw a man in a pickup truck watching the fire. Keen Observer could describe him fairly well, and looked forward to doing so. Minding My Own Business had a friend who worked the late shift at Hill’s Drug Store. After work they had seen a movie, then he had driven her back, as she had forgotten to lock a cabinet full of prescription medicines. It had bothered her all during the movie. When they got to the store, flames were billowing forth, so it was not possible to go inside. However, while she was at the door, he saw a man leaving from the drug store’s side door. Fortunately, Minding My Own Business didn’t believe that the arsonist, who looked quickly up and down the street, and then ran like a man possessed down the street, had seen him. Minding My Own Business had studied art in high school, and would be able to sketch the person he saw. I called Inspector Samuels. “Your hunch has paid off, Inspector. One of my readers can offer real help to you in solving this crime.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What was and what was NOT public knowledge  \n  – That several fires had occurred on Main Street was common knowledge.  \n  – The exact way they had been started (rags soaked in kerosene) and, most important, the place where the black-mailer wanted the money left – “behind a loose brick in the elementary-school yard wall” – were held back by the police and never appeared in the papers.  \n  – Only the arsonist (and, of course, the police) could know about that wall and would have any business examining it.\n\n2. Reading the four letters  \n a) Scared Stiff says she saw a “burly man” run out of Bradley Men’s Store just after midnight, 11 March.  \n b) Watchful Waiter, whose snack bar faces the school, twice saw a woman climb over the school-yard wall late in the afternoon and wrote down her licence-plate number.  \n c) Keen Observer saw a man in a pick-up watching the Sunnydale house burn.  \n d) Minding My Own Business tells a dramatic story about arriving at Hill’s Drug Store while “flames were billowing forth.”\n\n3. Looking for impossibilities or inside knowledge  \n – Hill’s Drug fire (4 March) was put out almost at once; there were sprinklers and very little actual flame.  “Flames billowing forth” (letter d) is pure invention.  \n – The letter that gives the police something they did NOT already have is letter b: a registration number that can be traced.  \n – Why was that woman interested in the exact stretch of wall that only the arsonist and the police knew about?  Because she had put the ransom instructions there herself and was checking to see whether the money had been paid.\n\n4. The misdirection  \n Knowing she had been seen near the wall, the arsonist tried to divert suspicion by writing another letter in which she presented herself as merely a frightened witness (letter a).  She invents a “burly man” and begs for police protection.  This explains why the only really useful clue comes from Watchful Waiter and why Crusher tells Inspector Samuels, “One of my readers can offer real help.”  That reader is Watchful Waiter; his number plate will identify the woman – the same woman who signs herself Scared Stiff.\n\n5. Who actually set the fires?  \n The woman who chose the drop, returned twice to check it, and then tried to throw the investigation off with a false eyewitness story must be the arsonist.  No accomplice is needed; she could light the roof fire at Bradley’s, drive the three miles south while the fire-department was busy, and torch the Sunnydale house herself (changing into work clothes and a cap could let Keen Observer mistake her for a man in the dark).\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nScared Stiff, Watchful Waiter, Keen Observer, Minding My Own Business, “woman seen climbing the school wall”, “man in the pick-up”, “burly man running from Bradley’s”\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nScared Stiff  (legal identity to be obtained from the licence plate supplied by Watchful Waiter)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• 1 March, just after midnight – Scared Stiff (the future letter-writer) makes her trial run, burning Green’s Hardware.  \n• 4 March – She sets a small fire at Hill’s Drug, then telephones the police, demanding money be left behind a loose brick in the elementary-school yard wall.  \n• 4 – 9 March – She twice returns to the wall, hoping to collect the cash.  Watchful Waiter sees her each time and notes her car number.  \n• 11 March, 00:15 – She places kerosene-soaked rags on the roof of Bradley Men’s Store, slips out the front door, and drives away.  Scared Stiff later pretends to have witnessed this.  \n• 11 March, 00:45 – While the fire brigade is busy on Main Street, she sets fire to the empty house on Sunnydale Drive, then parks nearby in a pick-up to watch her handiwork.  Keen Observer passes and sees the “man” in the truck.  \n• After the double fire she realises she may have been seen near the wall, so she mails a misleading letter as “Scared Stiff,” inventing a burly male arsonist, in the hope of directing the investigation away from herself.  \n• Crusher’s newspaper appeal brings in all four letters.  The licence plate in Watchful Waiter’s letter gives the police her true name and address, and the case is solved.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nWatchful Waiter – He simply observed someone at the school wall and gave the police the crucial licence number.  No inconsistency in his story.  \nKeen Observer – His account matches the known time and place of the Sunnydale fire and adds no inside information.  Nothing links him to any of the other fires.  \nMinding My Own Business – His colourful “billowing flames” story cannot be true (the Hill’s Drug blaze was doused in minutes), but that merely shows he was trying to cash in on the reward; it does not put him at any crime scene or give him secret knowledge.  \nThe “burly man” and the “man in the pick-up” – Both are inventions or misidentifications created or relied upon by the real arsonist to muddy the waters.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Three of the tipsters were giving false information, thanks to the fact that they were guessing about the real facts of the arson cases. Keen Observer did not know that the residential fire had been set after the commercial fire. If he had been listening to the shortwave police and fire department calls, as he said, he would have heard that. Minding My Own Business described the drug store fire as much more extensive than it actually was, for the fast fire department response and the sprinkler system contained the fire quickly, and there were no “flames billowing forth” from the drug store. Scared Stiff described the arsonist running out the front door. However, since the fire had been set at the rooftop level, the arsonist would have escaped by climbing over the roofs of adjoining stores, then going down a fire escape to safety.\nWatchful Waiter gets his reward, which he richly deserves. Since news of the arsonist’s suggested dropoff location had not been made public, Watchful Waiter was reporting a genuinely suspicious occurrence, not adding false details to something that was public knowledge. His information broke the case and earned him a hero’s welcome in the town that he helped save from further vicious and deliberate arson fires.",

This time it was Hill’s Drug Store. It was late at night again, but the fire department was revved up for action, and had put an extra crew on the late shift. They were there within minutes of being called, and the fire was put out without much damage, except for some water damage from the sprinkler system. A call came to the police station, from a public phone, offering to stop the fires if a large sum of money was paid. A location was given for the answer to be dropped off, behind a loose brick in the schoolyard wall by the elementary school. The location was well chosen. Anybody there could see clearly in all directions for blocks. The police chose to ignore the call, and the arsonist struck again. This time, he struck twice, on March 11. It was that double arson I was telling you about. A fire was set, once again on Main Street, on the roof of the building that houses the Bradley Men’s Store. Fortunately a passerby saw it and called the fire department on his cell phone. Damage was contained, and the fire department was feeling good about that, when they were called about the residential fire on Sunnydale Drive, outside of town. While the fire department had been occupied with the commercial fire, the house burned to the ground. Fortunately, the family was out of town, and they had even taken their pets to be boarded during their trip. That was when I put the call for help in my Ask Martha column. Sure enough, there were four replies. I read them over carefully. All referenced the reward money that the Main Street Commercial Association was offering for information that led to identifying the arsonist. Inspector Samuels and I hoped that there would be a useful clue in one of those replies. Scared Stiff said that she had been driving along Main Street on March 11, when she had seen the fire break out at Bradley Men’s Store. It was a little after midnight. She could describe the arsonist, who was running out the front door. She said she had gotten a good look at him before he disappeared into a nearby alley. She wanted police protection, though, because he was a burly man, and she was, as she said, Scared Stiff. Watchful Waiter worked across the street from the elementary school, at the snack bar, which was still prospering despite the economic hard times. Kids never seemed to lose their appetites for fudgecicles and popsicles and had a few coins to pay for them. The Snack Shoppe had the sense to break open packages of these treats, so that they were for sale one fudgesicle or popsicle at a time. Looking out his store window a few days previously, Watchful Waiter had seen a woman look both ways, then climb the low schoolyard wall. This was late in the afternoon, after school had let out for the day. He had thought nothing about it, until the action was repeated a few days later. Now, he was wondering if this could have had anything to do with the arsons under investigation. He could describe the woman, and the second time it happened, he had made a note of her car’s license plate number. Keen Observer lived outside of town. He was driving home from a long trip, monitoring the police calls throughout the evening on his car shortwave radio. He listened all the way home, hearing about a residential fire, which bothered him until the address was clearly given. He thought it might be his home. Passing Sunnydale Drive, not far from his own home, he saw a man in a pickup truck watching the fire. Keen Observer could describe him fairly well, and looked forward to doing so. Minding My Own Business had a friend who worked the late shift at Hill’s Drug Store. After work they had seen a movie, then he had driven her back, as she had forgotten to lock a cabinet full of prescription medicines. It had bothered her all during the movie. When they got to the store, flames were billowing forth, so it was not possible to go inside. However, while she was at the door, he saw a man leaving from the drug store’s side door. Fortunately, Minding My Own Business didn’t believe that the arsonist, who looked quickly up and down the street, and then ran like a man possessed down the street, had seen him. Minding My Own Business had studied art in high school, and would be able to sketch the person he saw. I called Inspector Samuels. “Your hunch has paid off, Inspector. One of my readers can offer real help to you in solving this crime.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Keen Observer; (b) Minding My Own Business; (c) Scared Stiff; (d) Watchful Waiter",
      "answer": "(d) Watchful Waiter",
      "outcome": "Three of the tipsters were giving false information, thanks to the fact that they were guessing about the real facts of the arson cases. Keen Observer did not know that the residential fire had been set after the commercial fire. If he had been listening to the shortwave police and fire department calls, as he said, he would have heard that. Minding My Own Business described the drug store fire as much more extensive than it actually was, for the fast fire department response and the sprinkler system contained the fire quickly, and there were no “flames billowing forth” from the drug store. Scared Stiff described the arsonist running out the front door. However, since the fire had been set at the rooftop level, the arsonist would have escaped by climbing over the roofs of adjoining stores, then going down a fire escape to safety.\nWatchful Waiter gets his reward, which he richly deserves. Since news of the arsonist’s suggested dropoff location had not been made public, Watchful Waiter was reporting a genuinely suspicious occurrence, not adding false details to something that was public knowledge. His information broke the case and earned him a hero’s welcome in the town that he helped save from further vicious and deliberate arson fires."
