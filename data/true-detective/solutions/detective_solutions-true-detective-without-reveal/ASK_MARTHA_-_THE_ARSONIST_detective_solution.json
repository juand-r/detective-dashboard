    "full_text": "The arsonist had the town police stumped. It was a series of vicious fires, set to produce a large ransom from the town. Already, several stores in the old Main Street commercial section had been hit. They were on a continuous block of stores on both sides of the street, with a common roof. One of them had burned nearly to the ground. Then there was a particularly vicious episode, when the fire department, distracted by a commercial fire, arrived too late at a residential fire three miles south of the city. The hallmark of that arson, rags soaked in kerosene, was the same as the fires set in the commercial section. Clearly, the arsonist was upping the ante. Clues were hard to come by, and the arsonist had called in a warning to the local radio station, KPKR. Anybody who helped the police would find their house or place of business was the next target. That’s when Inspector Samuels had his bright idea. He called me up. “Crusher,” he said, “why don’t you ask for clues through your column?” It seemed that our previous working together, to solve The Litterer Case, had given me real credibility with his boss, our Chief of Police. I am sure that they were both hearing from the Mayor as well. “Sure, Inspector, I’d be glad to help,” I said. That’s why I put in my advice column, Ask Martha, a request for help, for anyone who had seen or knew anything about the arsonist. People writing in were told to make duplicates of their letters, for identification, and to claim the reward money for the entry that helped the police solve the crime - if there was any help, that is. If you are wondering why a 6 foot 6, 265 pound former all state football player named Crusher Davis is writing the advice column under the name Ask Martha, you haven’t been on the job market lately! All I can say is, the money is all right, and I rather enjoy doling out advice, when there isn’t a football game or City Hall scandal to cover, that is. Fortunately, my identity as Martha was a secret, so my home was safe. Inspector Samuels briefed me on the fires. There was newspaper speculation, but precise details of the arson crimes had not been made public. There had been four so far, all in the current month of March. The first one, which broke out just after midnight on Sunday, March 1, was set in the commercial section on Main Street and did serious damage to Green’s Hardware Store, with smoke damage to adjacent stores. That one remained a mystery, for there were no demands for money or anything of that sort. It was just setting us up, I guess. On March 4, the arsonist struck once again, in the very same block. This time it was Hill’s Drug Store. It was late at night again, but the fire department was revved up for action, and had put an extra crew on the late shift. They were there within minutes of being called, and the fire was put out without much damage, except for some water damage from the sprinkler system. A call came to the police station, from a public phone, offering to stop the fires if a large sum of money was paid. A location was given for the answer to be dropped off, behind a loose brick in the schoolyard wall by the elementary school. The location was well chosen. Anybody there could see clearly in all directions for blocks. The police chose to ignore the call, and the arsonist struck again. This time, he struck twice, on March 11. It was that double arson I was telling you about. A fire was set, once again on Main Street, on the roof of the building that houses the Bradley Men’s Store. Fortunately a passerby saw it and called the fire department on his cell phone. Damage was contained, and the fire department was feeling good about that, when they were called about the residential fire on Sunnydale Drive, outside of town. While the fire department had been occupied with the commercial fire, the house burned to the ground. Fortunately, the family was out of town, and they had even taken their pets to be boarded during their trip. That was when I put the call for help in my Ask Martha column. Sure enough, there were four replies. I read them over carefully. All referenced the reward money that the Main Street Commercial Association was offering for information that led to identifying the arsonist. Inspector Samuels and I hoped that there would be a useful clue in one of those replies. Scared Stiff said that she had been driving along Main Street on March 11, when she had seen the fire break out at Bradley Men’s Store. It was a little after midnight. She could describe the arsonist, who was running out the front door. She said she had gotten a good look at him before he disappeared into a nearby alley. She wanted police protection, though, because he was a burly man, and she was, as she said, Scared Stiff. Watchful Waiter worked across the street from the elementary school, at the snack bar, which was still prospering despite the economic hard times. Kids never seemed to lose their appetites for fudgecicles and popsicles and had a few coins to pay for them. The Snack Shoppe had the sense to break open packages of these treats, so that they were for sale one fudgesicle or popsicle at a time. Looking out his store window a few days previously, Watchful Waiter had seen a woman look both ways, then climb the low schoolyard wall. This was late in the afternoon, after school had let out for the day. He had thought nothing about it, until the action was repeated a few days later. Now, he was wondering if this could have had anything to do with the arsons under investigation. He could describe the woman, and the second time it happened, he had made a note of her car’s license plate number. Keen Observer lived outside of town. He was driving home from a long trip, monitoring the police calls throughout the evening on his car shortwave radio. He listened all the way home, hearing about a residential fire, which bothered him until the address was clearly given. He thought it might be his home. Passing Sunnydale Drive, not far from his own home, he saw a man in a pickup truck watching the fire. Keen Observer could describe him fairly well, and looked forward to doing so. Minding My Own Business had a friend who worked the late shift at Hill’s Drug Store. After work they had seen a movie, then he had driven her back, as she had forgotten to lock a cabinet full of prescription medicines. It had bothered her all during the movie. When they got to the store, flames were billowing forth, so it was not possible to go inside. However, while she was at the door, he saw a man leaving from the drug store’s side door. Fortunately, Minding My Own Business didn’t believe that the arsonist, who looked quickly up and down the street, and then ran like a man possessed down the street, had seen him. Minding My Own Business had studied art in high school, and would be able to sketch the person he saw. I called Inspector Samuels. “Your hunch has paid off, Inspector. One of my readers can offer real help to you in solving this crime.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What was public knowledge?\n   •  Four fires, all on 1, 4 and 11 March; one of them residential.  \n   •  They were all in the late-night / just-after-midnight hours.  \n   •  The town had received an anonymous demand for money.  \n   •  Nothing more—​the police had suppressed every technical or tactical detail.\n\n2.  What information was definitely NOT public?\n   •  The exact pick-up spot named by the extortionist – “behind a loose brick in the elementary-school yard wall.”  \n   •  That the Hill’s Drug Store blaze had in fact been knocked down almost immediately and was little more than smoke and sprinkler damage; there were never “billowing flames”.  \n   •  That the roof of Bradley’s Men’s Store, not the sales floor, had been ignited.\n\n3.  The four letters\n   A. “Scared Stiff” – saw a “burly man” run out of Bradley’s front door.  That is possible, and she mentions no facts outsiders could not know.  \n   B. “Watchful Waiter” – from across the school he twice saw a woman climb the wall.  He does not mention the brick, so what he says is perfectly reconcilable with the secret pick-up point.  The licence-plate number he noted is potentially solid evidence.  \n   C. “Keen Observer” – simply saw a man in a pick-up watching the Sunnydale blaze.  Nothing here is impossible or privileged.  \n   D. “Minding My Own Business” – claims that when he and his girlfriend returned to Hill’s Drug Store “flames were billowing forth” and that, standing at the blazing front door, he saw a man run out the side door.  In reality that fire had already been put out by the sprinkler system and the first-in crew.  If the fire was over and the premises wet with sprinklers and fire-hoses, there could not have been “billowing flames,” still less anybody inside to come racing out.  \n      → He therefore describes an event that never happened – a sure sign he is inventing a story, i.e. covering his own tracks.\n\n4.  Motive & opportunity\n   •  “Minding My Own Business” had every opportunity: he admits he was at Hill’s just before the fire (collecting his girlfriend), knows the layout (he cites the side door), and can come back at any hour under a perfectly innocent pretext (“she forgot to lock the narcotics cabinet”).  \n   •  Once that store fire drew no ransom money he had to raise the stakes – hence the Bradley roof blaze and, as a diversion, the empty house on Sunnydale.  \n   •  He would naturally be anxious to direct police to “a burly man” (Scared Stiff’s letter) or a woman (Watchful Waiter’s letter) and away from himself—so he writes a letter portraying himself as a helpful witness while sowing a false trail.\n\n5.  Why the inspector’s “hunch” pointed to only one useful letter   \n   The licence-plate information in Watchful Waiter’s note is the single concrete lead.  Checking the number will produce the name of the car’s owner—​the girlfriend from Hill’s.  From her the investigation leads directly to the boyfriend who really set the fires: “Minding My Own Business.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\n“Scared Stiff”, “Watchful Waiter”, “Keen Observer”, “Minding My Own Business”\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\n“Minding My Own Business” – real name Frank (or “Francis”) Miller, the boyfriend of the night clerk at Hill’s Drug Store\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Frank Miller’s girlfriend worked the late shift at Hill’s Drug Store.  Frank conceived a plan to steal narcotics, destroy evidence with fire and, when that succeeded, turn arson into a town-wide protection racket.  \n•  1 March – he makes a trial run, burning Green’s Hardware after midnight.  \n•  4 March – during his girlfriend’s shift he hides kerosene-soaked rags in Hill’s.  After the couple leave for a movie a timer or delayed fuse ignites them.  The sprinkler system keeps damage low, frustrating him.  \n•  Still that night he telephones the police, demanding ransom and naming the “loose brick” at the school wall for the answer.  \n•  5–7 March – he twice visits the brick to look for money; “Watchful Waiter” sees the intrusions and notes the car plate.  \n•  11 March – angry at being ignored, Miller lights two more fires: the Bradley roof fire to distract the fire-service and, while they are busy, the empty house on Sunnydale Drive.  \n•  To deflect suspicion he writes to the newspaper under the signature “Minding My Own Business,” posing as an innocent witness, inventing “billowing flames” and a mysterious stranger who ran from Hill’s side door.  \n•  The licence-plate sighting supplied by Watchful Waiter steers police to the girlfriend’s car, then to Miller.  Faced with the impossibility of his story (no big blaze at Hill’s, sprinkler records showing the fire out in minutes), Miller finally breaks and confesses.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Scared Stiff really did pass Bradley’s just after midnight and saw someone bolt from the front entrance; her account, while imperfect, contains no inside information and is corroborated by time and location.  \n•  Watchful Waiter merely observed the culprit’s girlfriend retrieving messages at the school wall.  His licence-plate note is genuine and becomes the key to the case.  \n•  Keen Observer simply noticed a bystander in a pick-up at the Sunnydale fire – probably another curious local resident.  His statement is straightforward and contains no contradictions.  \nOnly “Minding My Own Business” knew details that were not public yet still got them wrong, and only he had both motive and opportunity; the others are honest witnesses.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Three of the tipsters were giving false information, thanks to the fact that they were guessing about the real facts of the arson cases. Keen Observer did not know that the residential fire had been set after the commercial fire. If he had been listening to the shortwave police and fire department calls, as he said, he would have heard that. Minding My Own Business described the drug store fire as much more extensive than it actually was, for the fast fire department response and the sprinkler system contained the fire quickly, and there were no “flames billowing forth” from the drug store. Scared Stiff described the arsonist running out the front door. However, since the fire had been set at the rooftop level, the arsonist would have escaped by climbing over the roofs of adjoining stores, then going down a fire escape to safety.\nWatchful Waiter gets his reward, which he richly deserves. Since news of the arsonist’s suggested dropoff location had not been made public, Watchful Waiter was reporting a genuinely suspicious occurrence, not adding false details to something that was public knowledge. His information broke the case and earned him a hero’s welcome in the town that he helped save from further vicious and deliberate arson fires.",

That one remained a mystery, for there were no demands for money or anything of that sort. It was just setting us up, I guess. On March 4, the arsonist struck once again, in the very same block. This time it was Hill’s Drug Store. It was late at night again, but the fire department was revved up for action, and had put an extra crew on the late shift. They were there within minutes of being called, and the fire was put out without much damage, except for some water damage from the sprinkler system. A call came to the police station, from a public phone, offering to stop the fires if a large sum of money was paid. A location was given for the answer to be dropped off, behind a loose brick in the schoolyard wall by the elementary school. The location was well chosen. Anybody there could see clearly in all directions for blocks. The police chose to ignore the call, and the arsonist struck again. This time, he struck twice, on March 11. It was that double arson I was telling you about. A fire was set, once again on Main Street, on the roof of the building that houses the Bradley Men’s Store. Fortunately a passerby saw it and called the fire department on his cell phone. Damage was contained, and the fire department was feeling good about that, when they were called about the residential fire on Sunnydale Drive, outside of town. While the fire department had been occupied with the commercial fire, the house burned to the ground. Fortunately, the family was out of town, and they had even taken their pets to be boarded during their trip. That was when I put the call for help in my Ask Martha column. Sure enough, there were four replies. I read them over carefully. All referenced the reward money that the Main Street Commercial Association was offering for information that led to identifying the arsonist. Inspector Samuels and I hoped that there would be a useful clue in one of those replies. Scared Stiff said that she had been driving along Main Street on March 11, when she had seen the fire break out at Bradley Men’s Store. It was a little after midnight. She could describe the arsonist, who was running out the front door. She said she had gotten a good look at him before he disappeared into a nearby alley. She wanted police protection, though, because he was a burly man, and she was, as she said, Scared Stiff. Watchful Waiter worked across the street from the elementary school, at the snack bar, which was still prospering despite the economic hard times. Kids never seemed to lose their appetites for fudgecicles and popsicles and had a few coins to pay for them. The Snack Shoppe had the sense to break open packages of these treats, so that they were for sale one fudgesicle or popsicle at a time. Looking out his store window a few days previously, Watchful Waiter had seen a woman look both ways, then climb the low schoolyard wall. This was late in the afternoon, after school had let out for the day. He had thought nothing about it, until the action was repeated a few days later. Now, he was wondering if this could have had anything to do with the arsons under investigation. He could describe the woman, and the second time it happened, he had made a note of her car’s license plate number. Keen Observer lived outside of town. He was driving home from a long trip, monitoring the police calls throughout the evening on his car shortwave radio. He listened all the way home, hearing about a residential fire, which bothered him until the address was clearly given. He thought it might be his home. Passing Sunnydale Drive, not far from his own home, he saw a man in a pickup truck watching the fire. Keen Observer could describe him fairly well, and looked forward to doing so. Minding My Own Business had a friend who worked the late shift at Hill’s Drug Store. After work they had seen a movie, then he had driven her back, as she had forgotten to lock a cabinet full of prescription medicines. It had bothered her all during the movie. When they got to the store, flames were billowing forth, so it was not possible to go inside. However, while she was at the door, he saw a man leaving from the drug store’s side door. Fortunately, Minding My Own Business didn’t believe that the arsonist, who looked quickly up and down the street, and then ran like a man possessed down the street, had seen him. Minding My Own Business had studied art in high school, and would be able to sketch the person he saw. I called Inspector Samuels. “Your hunch has paid off, Inspector. One of my readers can offer real help to you in solving this crime.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Keen Observer; (b) Minding My Own Business; (c) Scared Stiff; (d) Watchful Waiter",
      "answer": "(d) Watchful Waiter",
      "outcome": "Three of the tipsters were giving false information, thanks to the fact that they were guessing about the real facts of the arson cases. Keen Observer did not know that the residential fire had been set after the commercial fire. If he had been listening to the shortwave police and fire department calls, as he said, he would have heard that. Minding My Own Business described the drug store fire as much more extensive than it actually was, for the fast fire department response and the sprinkler system contained the fire quickly, and there were no “flames billowing forth” from the drug store. Scared Stiff described the arsonist running out the front door. However, since the fire had been set at the rooftop level, the arsonist would have escaped by climbing over the roofs of adjoining stores, then going down a fire escape to safety.\nWatchful Waiter gets his reward, which he richly deserves. Since news of the arsonist’s suggested dropoff location had not been made public, Watchful Waiter was reporting a genuinely suspicious occurrence, not adding false details to something that was public knowledge. His information broke the case and earned him a hero’s welcome in the town that he helped save from further vicious and deliberate arson fires."
