    "full_text": "The beach was crowded, and Glen had to be careful as he maneuvered in and out and around the multitude of bathers and sun-worshippers with his metal detector. It was a hot day even for July 1st, not a cloud in the sky and that had brought out the hordes anxious to escape the nitty-gritty furnace of the city. It was only eleven in the morning, but Glen had already made a pretty good haul – $4.65 in loose change, a pair of slightly bent sunglasses, one fully functioning watch and two rings (one of which appeared to be at least 10K gold). People sometimes made fun of Glen as he scouted around with his long-handled magnetic machine, sweeping it back and forth over the ground, headphones on, listening for the beeping sound that signaled buried metal. But he looked at it this way: not only was he enriching himself to a certain extent (to supplement his meager teacher’s pension) and getting some much-needed exercise, but he was also providing a community service. Because along with the valuables, he also uncovered and removed from the dirt or the sand loose can pull-tabs, bottle caps and openers, misplaced keys and other sharp metal objects which could cut unsuspecting bare feet or other body parts, if stepped on or fallen on the wrong way. Glen pushed back the floppy brim of his Tilley hat and mopped his forehead, promising himself a hot dog and cold soda for lunch with the money he’d found. He was up by the entrance to the beach, and as he bent his head and machine back down, he noticed a plastic bag sticking out of the sand about ten feet to his left. Often his bespectacled eyes were just as adept as his metal-detecting machine at finding treasure, and such was the case here. Because as Glen bent down and pulled the sealed plastic sandwich bag out of the sand, he saw that it contained money – lots of it, in bills and coins. He grinned, eyes lighting up like a slot machine that’s hit Jackpot! Then he frowned slightly, noting that the brightly colored bills and large golden and silver coins weren’t good ol’ American greenbacks and change, but rather Canadian currency. Sadly, they were not legal tender in Nebraska, where Glen lived. But the money could still be exchanged at a bank for American cash (at a slight discount, given the Canadian dollar’s lower value relative to the US dollar). Glen’s grin went back up again, as he prepared to open the baggie and count up his loot. Suddenly, though, he was surrounded by four fellow beachgoers who’d seen him pick up the moneybag. They closed in on him, loudly proclaiming the dough as their own. Glen quickly stashed the found money in his fanny pack for safekeeping and then held up his hand. “Hold on, folks!” he addressed the two men, one woman and one child, all of whom were clad in nothing but swimsuits. “What do you mean ‘hold on’?” the stocky blonde man protested. “That’s my money. It dropped out of my pants pocket on my way onto the beach. Now give it here!” “Not so fast, Blondie,” the redheaded woman cut in. “That’s my cash. I put it in the plastic baggie so I could bury it in the sand beneath my clothing – so it wouldn’t get stolen when I went swimming. But I lost it on my way down to the beach.” “That money’s mine, mister!” the tall bald man exclaimed. “I keep it in a plastic baggie when I go to the beach so it doesn’t get wet. I’m Canadian. I’d show you my passport … but I don’t have it with me.” He gestured at his swim trunks. “I’m Canadian, too,” the little black-haired girl stated, looking forlornly up at Glen. “My parents and I are visiting my sick Grandmother down here. That’s all the money I brought with me to buy presents for her. I put it in a plastic bag to take to the bank to change into American money.” She reached for Glen’s fanny pack. He took a step back, holding his metal detector up as a barrier to the avarice crowd. As a former schoolteacher, he knew a little something about the Great White North, having taught North American studies in high school for years. So, like all teachers, he felt that a pop quiz was in order, to identify the true Canuck owner of the Canadian currency. “How many provinces are there in Canada, young lady?” he asked the little black-haired girl. “Ten,” she promptly replied, smiling sweetly. “And what’s the capital city of Canada?” “Toronto,” she responded, just as confidently. Glen turned to the stocky blonde man. “What are Canada’s two official languages, sir?” The man grunted and grinned. “They are English and French, of course.” “And who was the earliest European explorer to discover Canada?” “You mean besides the Vikings?” He scratched his chin. “Well, it was, of course … Jacques Cartier.” He held out a hand for the cash. Glen moved on to the tall bald man, giving nothing away. “What’s on the Canadian flag, sir?” “It is a maple leaf,” the man instantly answered, “a red maple leaf.” “And what is the largest lake situated entirely in your country?” Glen asked. The man hesitated, turning even redder than his sunburn. “Uh, well, that’s kind of a tough one …” The little black-haired girl giggled. “Let’s see, Lake Winnipeg is quite large. And there’s, uh, Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake, up in the Northwest Territories.” He shrugged. “To be honest, I’m not a hundred percent sure which is the largest.” The redheaded woman snorted. “Honest, he says.” “Okay,” Glen said, turning to her. “Does Canada have a President, like we do?” The woman smiled. “What is this, twenty questions? We have a Prime Minister.” “And whose picture is on the Canadian one-dollar bill, madam?” “The one-dollar bill? Why, um, that would be … the Queen!” Glen unzipped his fanny pack and pulled out the plastic baggie full of Canadian currency. “I can now return this to its rightful owner,” he stated.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Glen reasons that the money almost certainly belongs to a Canadian visitor – nobody who actually lives in Nebraska carries a plastic bag full of Canadian coins and bank-notes.\n2.  All four claimants therefore have to be Canadian.  The quickest way for a retired teacher to check that is to give them a mini “civics” quiz that any ordinary Canadian should pass without hesitation.\n3.  The key facts every Canadian learns in grade school are\n   • ten provinces;\n   • capital city = Ottawa;\n   • two official languages = English and French;\n   • national flag carries a red maple leaf;\n   • there is no one-dollar bank-note any more – it was replaced by the gold-coloured “loonie” in 1987 (although the old $1 bills are still legal tender, an average Canadian would answer “we don’t have a one-dollar bill” rather than naming the portrait that used to be on it).\n   • Largest lake completely inside Canada is Great Bear Lake (a piece of information few people outside Canada – and not all Canadians – know).\n\n4.  How the answers stack up\n   • Little girl – gets provinces right but thinks the capital is Toronto, so she is definitely not Canadian.\n   • Stocky blond man – gets languages right but says the earliest explorer (after the Vikings) was Jacques Cartier.  Every Canadian history text starts with John Cabot’s 1497 landfall at Newfoundland.  Wrong again.\n   • Tall bald man – knows the maple leaf, but cannot name Great Bear Lake.  He might still be Canadian, but the real owner of a bag stuffed with money would surely be sure of his nationality and would not hesitate over a standard geography question.\n   • Red-haired woman – knows Canada has a Prime Minister, but, when asked whose picture is on the Canadian one-dollar bill, she confidently answers “the Queen”.  A Canadian would immediately reply, “There ISN’T a one-dollar bill any more – we use the loonie coin.”  Her answer brands her a non-Canadian.\n\n5.  Every one of the four produces at least one answer no genuine Canadian would give, but only one of those wrong answers is absolutely unmistakable and cannot be put down to a momentary lapse or to ignorance of trivia: believing that Canada still uses a one-dollar bill.  That singles out the redhead.  Once Glen hears that, he knows she is an impostor and the most aggressive would-be thief.\n\n6.  Consequently Glen realises that none of the four is the real owner; he will hand the cash in to the police or to the beach lost-and-found.  But the “culprit” – the prime mover in the attempted swindle – is the red-haired woman.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nStocky blond man, Red-haired woman, Tall bald man, Little black-haired girl\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\n(the) Red-haired woman  –  alias “Redhead”\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nThe money had been lost earlier by some unknown Canadian holiday-maker.  \nGlen found it half buried near the beach entrance.  \nSeeing this, four by-standers tried to grab a windfall by claiming it was theirs.  \nGlen gave each a quick Canadian “pop quiz.”  \nThe little girl failed on the capital; the blond man failed on Canada’s earliest explorer; the bald man stumbled over Canada’s largest entirely domestic lake; the red-haired woman proved she was not Canadian at all when she insisted the old, long-withdrawn one-dollar bill still exists.  \nRealising that all four were lying – and that the redhead was the boldest fraud – Glen kept the cash to turn over to the authorities, foiling her attempted theft.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Little black-haired girl – merely a curious child who joined in the scramble; her wrong answer showed she was no Canadian and therefore not the money’s owner, but she posed no serious criminal intent.  \n•  Stocky blond man – bluffed in the hope of easy money; his historical mistake exposed him, but there is no indication he organised the ploy.  \n•  Tall bald man – may actually be Canadian (or may not) but his lack of certainty over Great Bear Lake and his hesitant manner showed he was just another opportunist, not the driving culprit.  \nOnly the red-haired woman responded with total – but totally wrong – assurance about a basic fact every Canadian knows, and she was the one who pressed her claim most aggressively.  That marks her as the principal would-be thief, i.e., the culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

And the Queen is indeed on the Canadian dollar, as the redheaded woman said, only Canada doesn’t have one-dollar ‘bills’, they have one-dollar ‘coins’ – loonies, as Canadians call them, because of the loon depicted on the opposite side of the coin from the Queen.\nThe tall bald man was correct about there being a red Maple Leaf on his country’s flag. And while he couldn’t name the exact Canadian lake that is the largest – a tough question even for Canadians – he did mention it: Great Bear Lake."
