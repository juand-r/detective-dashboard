    "full_text": "When the phone rang Monday morning, it was the last of Nan Holcomb’s worries. “What now?” she said, lifting her head from her desk. And however reluctant, she picked up the receiver. “Nan, it’s security. Can you have your employee return our Windex, paper towels, broom … and whatever else he took? He was down here all day Friday borrowing the kitchen sink!” “Who are we talking about here?” “I don’t know his name. … The guy with the long hair.” “Yup. OK. No problem,” she snorted, and hung up abruptly. She had more important things on her mind. Focusing again on the flower fund (an important thing), Nan picked up the receiver, and called security back, “I’m going to need access to my group’s phone records on Friday. I’ll also need the first floor security tapes.” The flower fund was kept locked away in the boss’s office. The fund in Nan Holcomb’s work group was not small pocket change — it totaled close to $500. And early Monday morning, Nan realized this money had been taken from her desk drawer. Nan thought she had hidden the cash well enough. After all, she always told her employees that it was locked in a small file cabinet, behind her bookcase. Nan was not happy to announce that the flower fund was missing. This unfortunate discovery ruined her good mood (she had been delighted with her new office, covered in light shades of white and beige. It was much brighter than her old office on floor three.) But what displeased Nan most was the realization that all of her employees were cunning and clever. Finding the flower fund would prove to be difficult. When Nan confronted her employees at their Monday meeting, she was uneasy. “As you know, normally, I keep my office locked, but the move last week disrupted us in more ways than one.” Nan’s group had moved from floor three to floor five, as part of a company wide reorganization. Constant chaos had been the order of the day for over two weeks. Sighing uncomfortably, Nan began the difficult part of the meeting, “The money was in its normal place Friday morning and I noticed it missing shortly before this meeting. Nobody knows about the fund except us, and first floor security does not show that any of you entered the building over the weekend. It had to have been taken by one of you while we were moving Friday afternoon. It had to have been after my office was moved … there was a period of time that I was away, and the door was unlocked.” James was the first to speak. “That’s quite an accusation, boss.” “I’ll be delighted if I’m proven wrong,” Nan replied, dryly. “That’s why we are going to spend as much time as we need to talk about this. James, we’ll begin with you. Where were you and what were you doing Friday afternoon?” James, brushing the hair away from his eyes, replied, “I split time between cleaning out my old cubicle and setting up the new one here.” This surprised Nan, as James was normally the messiest person in the office, with books scattered all over his work area. Linda was next with her explanation. “I was on the phone in a borrowed cubicle most of the afternoon with a client. In fact, the only time I wasn’t on the phone was when I went down to the first floor break room for a cold drink.” Nan turned next to Justin Thorn. Justin had done the group a big favor Friday by moving the copy machine out of its small room. As he did so, the bottled ink cartridge leaked and smeared all over his hands and clothes, ruining his pants and shoes. Justin’s explanation was believable enough: He had spent all afternoon cleaning the mess from the broken ink cartridge. Last to speak was Lincoln Smith. The likable Lincoln admitted to Nan that he had helped move her furniture up from floor three, but with help from building maintenance. At no time was he alone in her office. “Besides,” he said, “I checked to see that the desk drawers were locked because I didn’t want them to slide during the transition.” He mentioned the rest of his afternoon was spent working on his computer, taking phone calls and moving his own stuff. He assured Nan that he left an electronic paper trail to document his afternoon. Nan looked over her group. Already she was thinking about replacing the thief, who would shortly be terminated. Nan looked directly at the guilty team member and said, “Would you like to leave quietly or shall I have security usher you out?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  All four employees could use an easy US $500; motive alone does not pick the thief.\n\n2.  Opportunity  \n   •  The money disappeared Friday afternoon, after Nan’s office had been moved to the 5th floor and while the door was left unlocked for a short time.  \n   •  Any member of the group could have slipped in, but only one of them was actually inside Nan’s office during the move: Lincoln, who helped building-maintenance carry the furniture.\n\n3.  Who knew where the money really was?  \n   •  Nan had always told her staff the flower fund was “locked in a small file cabinet, behind my book-case.”  \n   •  In reality she kept the cash in the top drawer of her desk.  \n   •  Therefore the thief must have learnt the TRUE location sometime Friday.\n\n4.  Statements at the Monday meeting  \n   •  James: admits running back and forth for cleaning supplies – perfectly matches security’s complaint about “the guy with the long hair.” His story, though untidy, is corroborated.  \n   •  Linda: claims she was on the phone all afternoon. Nan has already ordered the phone records, but she has not seen them yet, so she cannot identify Linda as the culprit on the spot.  \n   •  Justin: explains the ink-cartridge disaster. Nothing in Nan’s knowledge contradicts it.  \n   •  Lincoln: “I helped move your furniture … I checked to see that the DESK DRAWERS were locked because I didn’t want them to slide during the transition.”\n\n   This single sentence gives Lincoln away.  \n   – If Lincoln believed Nan’s own story (that the money was in a file cabinet behind the book-case), the condition of the DESK drawers would not have concerned him.  \n   – The only reason to pay any attention to the desk drawers is that he had already seen the cash sitting in one of them while the furniture was being moved.  \n   – In other words, Lincoln revealed knowledge he could not legitimately have had unless he had discovered the hiding place – and once he had that knowledge, he had both motive and the later opportunity (when Nan left her door unlocked) to come back and take the money.\n\n5.  Additional red herrings  \n   •  The security-guard’s phone call about cleaning products points at James but proves nothing about the flower fund.  \n   •  Justin’s ink-splattered clothes merely make him look messy, not guilty.\n\n6.  Logical deduction  \n   The only employee whose own words demonstrate inside knowledge of where the cash was really hidden is Lincoln.  Nan therefore looks straight at him and gives him the choice of leaving quietly or being escorted out.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJames (long-haired cleaner), Linda (on the phone), Justin Thorn (ink mishap), Lincoln Smith (helped with furniture)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nLincoln Smith\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Friday afternoon, while assisting maintenance men in carrying Nan’s furniture from the 3rd to the 5th floor, Lincoln opened Nan’s desk to be sure the drawers would not slide out during transport.  \n•  He immediately spotted the large envelope containing roughly $500.  Now he knew Nan’s public story about the “locked file cabinet” was a ruse and that the cash was really in her top drawer.  \n•  After the furniture was in place on the 5th floor, Nan left her new office door unlocked for a short while.  Lincoln, pretending to be moving his own belongings, slipped back in, removed the envelope, and quietly relocked or shut the drawer.  \n•  To look busy and create an electronic alibi he sat at his computer sending e-mails and answering a few phone calls, claiming this left a “paper trail.”  \n•  Monday morning Nan discovered the loss and, during the staff meeting, picked up on Lincoln’s inadvertent admission that he had examined her desk drawers — knowledge he should never have had if he believed the money was in the file cabinet.  Caught, Lincoln was given the choice of walking out or being escorted by security.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  James:  Security’s description of him borrowing Windex, paper towels, etc., matches the job of cleaning two cubicles.  Nothing links him to Nan’s office or to foreknowledge of the real hiding place.  \n•  Linda:  Her alibi (long client call, brief trip to the 1st-floor break room) can be verified by the phone records Nan has already requested; Nan would not have confronted the thief before checking those records if Linda’s story looked false.  \n•  Justin Thorn:  His ink disaster explains his erratic movements and need for cleaning.  Security, however, saw James—not Justin—checking out the cleaning gear.  Had Justin fetched the supplies, security would have remembered the ink-covered man.  No evidence shows Justin ever entered Nan’s office or knew where the cash was kept.  \n•  Only Lincoln betrayed insider knowledge of the genuine hiding place and had the perfect window of opportunity after the move; therefore the others are innocent of this particular crime.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The stunned thief asked, “How did you know it was me?”\nNan paused for a moment, and then began, “James spoke first. I admit his story of intense cleaning and organizing made me suspicious, as normally he is anything but clean or organized. But, his old area downstairs is spotless, and plus, his new area is set up and ready to go. It looks like he’s been there for weeks, not just for a day. Also, security saw him downstairs constantly getting cleaning supplies.”\nNan paused and let her team digest what she had said, then continued. “Linda spoke next. Linda, you couldn’t be the thief, either. Telephone records will prove you were on the phone and the security guard will verify your presence in the break room.” Looking over her team, Nan added, “I know this group is smart enough not to lie about such things as telephone usage and security. Everyone here knows that most movements and activities in the company building are closely monitored – especially on the first floor.”\nNan again paused, her voice tightening as she got closer to identifying the thief, “It couldn’t be Justin. He had ink from the broken copy machine all over him, even on his shoes. It would have been impossible for him to not leave an ink smear somewhere, especially on the carpet. Even a small stain would have been noticeable in my new office. Everything is white or beige.”\nTurning to Lincoln, she said, with regret, “It had to be you, Lincoln. I believe you told the truth about building maintenance helping you move my things. I do not doubt that you were never in my office alone. I also have no doubt that you can verify all of your other afternoon activities.”\nLincoln interrupted her, “If you believe me, why do you think I stole the money?”\nSoftly, Nan replied, “You made a point to mention that the desk drawers were locked. I don’t know how you knew where to find the fund money but obviously you slipped it into your pocket when the maintenance man was not looking.”\nLincoln said, “I still don’t understand.”\n“Lincoln, I’ve always said the money was locked in the file cabinet. I never wanted anyone to know that it was actually in my desk.”",
