    "full_text": "Fred Foy’s wife passed away last year, leaving Fred a widower at age 65. Fred was grateful that his closest friends continued to include him in their social gatherings. So, it was at breakfast one morning at a local pancake house that Fred shared something with the Bakers and Cokers he had never shared with anyone. Retrieving an object from his pocket, he began to speak, “You four are our closest friends (Fred always spoke as if Bumps, his pet name for his wife, was still with them). It’s time to clear out some old business. I should’ve done this last year when Bumps passed away. I wish to show you this.” He opened his large hand and showed them what he had fished out of his pocket. It was a large, old-fashioned skeleton key. The five of them studied it in silence for several awkward moments. The key was impressive. Almost six inches long and plated with dullish gold, it was surprisingly light in weight. It was scratched in several places and was obviously very old. However, one of the friends knew its significance and what Fred was about to say. As if reading the mind of the “guilty” person, Fred continued, “As you know, our daughter Sarah died of leukemia in December of 1980, just before Christmas. That hurt has never gone away. It’s worse than losing Bumps last year.” Losing 12-year-old Sarah had thrown Fred and his wife into long bouts with depression. But, he continued, “A couple of years before her death, Sarah and Bumps found a large, old-fashioned door knob at a flea market and Bumps bought it for Sarah. It took me almost a week to get it installed on her bedroom door.” The memory of this brought a faint smile to Fred’s lips, “Now, I know there are two keys to the lock and I only have one. One of you has the other.” “What makes you think so, and why is it important?” asked Bill. “Because one of you was Sarah’s secret friend. She gave you the key. During the last few weeks of her life, it gave her great comfort to have such a bond with an adult person.” Fred stopped for a moment to let his words sink in. “Besides, the holder of the other key did some unusual things. After she died, several times when Bumps and I were away, you entered her room and left messages. We always kept her door locked, because Sarah felt secure when she locked herself in her room. Among other things, we learned that a scholarship had been funded in her name, a memorial stone was placed in her honor at church and the expenses for her funeral had been made by, as the funeral home director told us, “an anonymous benefactor and holder of the key.” Fred paused to look at his friends and stated simply, “It is time that I look whoever has the key in the eye and thank you properly for all three of us.” Nobody said a word until Lyn asked, “How did the person with the key get into your house?” Long ago, the Bakers, Cokers and Foys all traded house keys. It made it easy for them to check on one another’s homes when any of the families happened to be away. Fred smiled, “Perhaps you have forgotten that all of us have keys to each of our three homes.” Midge asked, “So, who do you think has the key?” Fred answered, “I don’t know.” Looking at his friends, he added, “If you won’t own up to it, perhaps you will allow me to ask a few questions.” “Ask away,” said Bill, as Harold nervously wiped his glasses with a red pocket cloth. Fred responded, “First, let me explain some things. We noticed the key missing about a month before Sarah passed on. At first, we thought she had hidden it. But a week before her death she said, “I gave it to one of your friends. I have a secret friend now.” We didn’t think anything of this until the messages began to show up in her room – a room we always kept locked in her honor, unless we were in there to clean and dust. Now, one time we found a cigarette lighter on the floor. Another time a piece of tissue paper and still another time, a Robert’s Book Store business card. We also noticed the handwritten notes were written in an awkward script. That could be a clue or not, as the writer may have intentionally disguised his or her writing style.” Fred paused to catch his breath as the waitress poured fresh cups of coffee. Fred nodded and turned to Bill, “So, what do you have to say for yourself?” “You know I am a smoker, but I’ve always used matches. I’m not Sarah’s secret friend, but would have liked to have been.” Harold flashed a smile of appreciation to his old friend, but he knew that somebody was still hiding the truth. He said to Lyn, “Tell me why you cannot be Sarah’s friend?” “Well, for one thing – I didn’t know you had a key to my house … I also didn’t know that we had a key to your house.” Turning to her husband, he asked “Harold, have you ever been a smoker?” Fred could not recall ever seeing Harold smoke in all the years he had known him, but realized that really didn’t count for much. Harold answered, “Yes, but I quit early, before meeting you and Darlene. My allergies just will not tolerate it.” Finally, Fred looked again at Midge and asked, “It seems to me that I recall you were a smoker.” “I was,” she admitted, but that was a long time ago.” “How long ago?” “Can’t remember for sure, but Ronald Reagan was president.” Fred didn’t need to ask more questions. He knew who his daughter’s secret friend was.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Identify what has to be solved  \n   – Not a murder, but the identity of “Sarah’s secret friend,” i.e. the person who took the second key, entered the girl’s room and later paid for the funeral, the scholarship and the memorial stone.  \n\n2.  List the four possible holders of the key  \n   – Bill Baker, Midge Baker, Harold Coker, Lyn Coker.  \n\n3.  Review opportunity  \n   – All four possessed a front-door key to the Foys’ house, so every one of them could physically enter the house while the Foys were away.  \n   – Lyn herself did not even realise the key-exchange existed; therefore she never used a key and can be excluded at once.  \n\n4.  Examine the physical clues left in the bedroom  \n   a) cigarette lighter  \n   b) piece of tissue paper  \n   c) Robert’s Book Store business card  \n   d) strange, disguised handwriting  \n\n5.  Confront each remaining suspect with the clues  \n\n   Bill Baker  \n   – Is a current smoker but says he “always used matches.”  \n   – If that is true, finding a lighter in the room points away from him.  \n   – Nothing links him to Robert’s Book Store or to tissues.  \n\n   Harold Coker  \n   – Admits he once smoked, but quit before he even met the Foys because of allergies.  \n   – Allergies make it unlikely he would still carry a lighter.  \n   – Wipes his glasses with a cloth (not tissue) – the tissue clue is therefore weak for him.  \n   – The single strong link would be a book-store card, but that alone is not decisive.  \n\n   Midge Baker  \n   – Admits she was a smoker “a long time ago … when Ronald Reagan was president.”  \n   – Sarah died in December 1980 – Reagan’s presidency (1981-89) overlaps almost perfectly with the last part of Sarah’s life; thus in 1980 Midge was still smoking and almost certainly carried a lighter.  \n   – Women commonly carry tissues; dropping one in the room would be natural.  \n   – Nothing contradicts her visiting Robert’s Book Store and accidentally leaving a card.  \n   – The Bakers had enough money to fund the scholarship and the other anonymous gifts.  \n\n6.  Deductive jump that clinches it for Fred  \n   – When Midge’s smoking dates line up precisely with the period of Sarah’s illness and the lighter was found in the bedroom, Fred realises she fits every physical clue, whereas the others do not.  \n   – Therefore Midge Baker must have been Sarah’s secret friend and the holder of the second key.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBill Baker, Midge Baker, Harold Coker, Lyn Coker\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMidge Baker\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nIn 1979-80 Sarah Foy, gravely ill with leukemia, formed a special bond with her neighbour Midge Baker.  \n1.  During visits Midge and Sarah installed the ornate doorknob on the girl’s bedroom door, and Sarah entrusted Midge with one of the two skeleton keys.  \n2.  Midge, still a smoker in those days, often carried a lighter in her purse.  \n3.  After each visit Midge re-locked the bedroom door so the parents would assume it had remained untouched.  \n4.  Once or twice she unintentionally left small items behind: a cigarette lighter, a tissue and a Robert’s Book Store business card.  \n5.  When Sarah died, Midge, wanting to spare the grieving parents further pain, quietly paid for the funeral, endowed the scholarship and placed the memorial stone—always insisting on anonymity and proving her right to act by producing the matching key to the door.  \n6.  Over the years she kept her promise to Sarah never to reveal her identity—until Fred’s gentle interrogation at the pancake house finally brought the truth into the open.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nBill Baker: Although a smoker, he insists he uses matches, not a lighter, making it unlikely he dropped one in Sarah’s room. No other clue ties him to the bedroom.  \n\nHarold Coker: Quit smoking long before meeting the Foys because of allergies; highly improbable he would still carry a lighter. The tissue and the book-store card alone are too slender to override this medical fact.  \n\nLyn Coker: Did not even know the friends possessed one another’s house keys, removing any realistic opportunity for her to enter the Foys’ home uninvited.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Fred patted Sarah’s secret friend gently on the shoulder. In a shaky voice, he said, “In the back of my mind I suspected it was you, but wasn’t sure until now. Thank you so much from all of us. Do you still have the key?”\nSarah’s friend was very moved and answered, “Yes, do you want it back?” Before Fred could answer, she asked, “How did you figure it out? It’s been a secret all these years.”\nFred said, “No, keep the key. I am certain Sarah would wish for you to have it. As for your other question, well, I didn’t think too much about it until Bumps died, then it began to play in my mind. I’ve wondered how much time I have left to thank a very kind and generous friend. But, I digress. In speaking with all four of you at the same time, it wasn’t too hard to sort this out, although I was frustrated at first. As I asked questions, I eliminated those who claimed not to have the items left in Sarah’s room.” Fred paused a moment for dramatic effect.\nHe continued, “I eliminated Bill because he does not use a lighter. I have no way of knowing if he was ever a customer of Robert’s Book Store or used paper tissue, but he proved to us that he uses matches. In Lyn’s case, she told us she did not know about the spare house key in Bill’s possession.”\nFred paused again, emotion catching up with him. “I wasn’t sure of Harold. But, he told us he quit smoking before we met him and I believe it. I’ve never seen him with a cigar or cigarette.”\nMidge said, “So why me? I’ve answered everything truthfully.”\nFred grinned, “I know, but you made a mistake.”\n“It was your comment concerning smoking. You said you quit sometime while Ronald Reagan was president. President Reagan took office in January of 1981. President Carter was still in office when Sarah passed away in December, 1980.”\nMidge stared at Fred with an incredulous look on her face. Softly, she said, “I forgot about President Carter. Well, you’re probably all wondering about Robert’s Book Store. Robert Ellingwood is my brother. The store went out of business shortly after Sarah died. The tissue was mine, too. … Guess I would not be a very good burglar – or historian.”\nFred smiled and said to her, “Bumps, Sarah and I owe you a debt that can never be repaid. I have learned some very important things about you today.”\nMidge returned his grin and replied, “The first is obvious. What are the others?\n“That you are kind hearted and do our Lord’s good work in secret, but that you also have a very poor memory and a tendency to lose things.”\nLaughter from Fred’s table could be heard throughout the large pancake house.",

Thank you so much from all of us. Do you still have the key?”\nSarah’s friend was very moved and answered, “Yes, do you want it back?” Before Fred could answer, she asked, “How did you figure it out? It’s been a secret all these years.”\nFred said, “No, keep the key. I am certain Sarah would wish for you to have it. As for your other question, well, I didn’t think too much about it until Bumps died, then it began to play in my mind. I’ve wondered how much time I have left to thank a very kind and generous friend. But, I digress. In speaking with all four of you at the same time, it wasn’t too hard to sort this out, although I was frustrated at first. As I asked questions, I eliminated those who claimed not to have the items left in Sarah’s room.” Fred paused a moment for dramatic effect.\nHe continued, “I eliminated Bill because he does not use a lighter. I have no way of knowing if he was ever a customer of Robert’s Book Store or used paper tissue, but he proved to us that he uses matches. In Lyn’s case, she told us she did not know about the spare house key in Bill’s possession.”\nFred paused again, emotion catching up with him. “I wasn’t sure of Harold. But, he told us he quit smoking before we met him and I believe it. I’ve never seen him with a cigar or cigarette.”\nMidge said, “So why me? I’ve answered everything truthfully.”\nFred grinned, “I know, but you made a mistake.”\n“It was your comment concerning smoking. You said you quit sometime while Ronald Reagan was president. President Reagan took office in January of 1981. President Carter was still in office when Sarah passed away in December, 1980.”\nMidge stared at Fred with an incredulous look on her face. Softly, she said, “I forgot about President Carter. Well, you’re probably all wondering about Robert’s Book Store. Robert Ellingwood is my brother. The store went out of business shortly after Sarah died. The tissue was mine, too. … Guess I would not be a very good burglar – or historian.”\nFred smiled and said to her, “Bumps, Sarah and I owe you a debt that can never be repaid. I have learned some very important things about you today.”\nMidge returned his grin and replied, “The first is obvious. What are the others?\n“That you are kind hearted and do our Lord’s good work in secret, but that you also have a very poor memory and a tendency to lose things.”\nLaughter from Fred’s table could be heard throughout the large pancake house."
