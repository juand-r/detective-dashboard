    "full_text": "Summertime in the southwest is hot. Often, the days are filled with blazing dry heat in July and August, after the humidity of early summer ends around the Fourth of July holiday. And so it was on a hot August afternoon when a group of friends met with the intention of going swimming. It had been decided that morning that Tim McNair and his girlfriend, Linda Sheldon, would join their friends at David Kelly’s home before heading to one of their community’s neighborhood pools. As there were six of them, it was determined that at least two cars would be needed to travel the three miles to the pool. It would be a birthday celebration, as Tim’s birthday was the next day. First, they would have lunch at the Kelly home. David and his girlfriend, Nancy, Larry Roberts and Donna Allen were at the Kelly home when Tim and Linda arrived just after noon. It was already 93 degrees outside and getting hotter. Tim drove an early 1980s model compact car that was noisy but ran smoothly and offered dependable transportation. When Tim parked in front of the Kelly home, he and Linda could feel the heat of the hot asphalt beneath their feet, even through their thin sandals. As they approached the front door, Mrs. Kelly, David’s mother, greeted them warmly as she invited them into her home. Smiling, she said, “Hi Linda. Hello Tim. Are you ready for sandwiches and iced tea?” “You bet!” Tim replied, with enthusiasm. “Yes ma’am,” offered Linda. “Glad to have you here,” answered Mrs. Kelly. “You will have to excuse the house being a bit uncomfortable. The air conditioner isn’t working properly.” The newcomers joined the others at the kitchen table. As they were the last to arrive, they were also the last to finish eating. While Tim wolfed down his peanut butter sandwich and drank his iced tea, Larry and Donna excused themselves to go change into pool clothes. After visiting with Tim and Linda for a few minutes, David and Nancy excused themselves for the same reason. Linda and Tim spent the next few minutes finishing lunch and visiting with Mrs. Kelly. Mrs. Kelly was a wonderful lady who had a very nice way with young people. As they visited, Tim heard noises coming from outside the kitchen. Though, he didn’t think anything of it, as he knew his friends would be preparing to leave for the pool. A few minutes later, Tim and Linda left the kitchen for the living room. Donna and Nancy were sitting on the sofa. Donna wore a two-piece bathing suit with a towel wrapped around her and a pair of dirty sneakers. Nancy was dressed in a similar swimsuit and sat next to her with an insulated case of soft drinks by her bare feet. Larry and David were nowhere in sight. Tim asked where they were. “Getting ready for the pool, I guess,” said Donna. Tim felt that something was not quite right, but couldn’t put his finger on it. This time, he asked Nancy if she knew where they were. She replied, simply, “I don’t know.” Just then, David and Larry walked in the front door. Tim was startled, as he assumed they were in the back bedrooms changing. Larry had on a t-shirt and swim trunks. David looked a bit silly -- he was already wearing goggles and walking awkwardly in bulky flippers. “Tim asked, \"Where have you guys been?” “Outside,” answered David, “I had to rinse off my flippers.” Tim saw they were still damp. Larry offered, “I went outside with him.” Tim noticed Larry wore a brand new white t-shirt and commented on how fresh it looked. “Yes, it’s new. I just took it out of the package when I changed clothes – look, it still has package wrinkles in it.” Tim still sensed something out of the ordinary. However, he didn’t say anything except, “Well, is everyone ready to go?” His friends looked at each other sheepishly and answered in unison, “Yes.” Walking outside, Tim soon realized why he felt as he did, and why his friends were acting so strange. His car was missing! A light bulb went off in his head when he realized his friends had pulled a birthday trick on him. He was not angry or unduly surprised. After all, he was known for the pranks he pulled on his friends. He expected this playful revenge. Looking at them, he said, calmly, “You stole my car.” “Yes, but only one of us took it. Can you figure out who it was?” asked David. Tim laughed, “Well, I know you have a spare key so it would be easy for any of you to drive it away. But – I didn’t hear it start up when I finished lunch. I’m betting one of you pushed it out of sight. It’s a small, lightweight car and I’m sure one of you simply rolled it downhill and around the block.” “Could be,” said Larry, cryptically. “So, which one of us moved your car?” asked Nancy. Donna chimed in, “Figure it out fast. I’m ready to go swimming!” Tim looked at her and said, “It looks like you are ready for swimming, and I know who moved my car.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. The prankster had to move Tim’s car without starting the engine (Tim never heard it).  \n   • So the car had to be rolled away by hand.  \n2. The afternoon pavement was blisteringly hot (93° F and climbing).  \n   • Anyone who spent more than a few seconds pushing a car on the street would need something substantial on his / her feet.  \n3. When Tim faced the group:  \n   • Nancy was barefoot – she could not have walked, let alone pushed a car, on that asphalt.  \n   • Larry’s footwear is never mentioned; when he re-entered he had only trunks and a brand-new white T-shirt.  That spotless shirt and the absence of shoes suggest he had not been out doing dirty work.  \n   • David was clumping about in huge rubber flippers.  Flippers protect the feet but make it almost impossible to walk any distance and absolutely impossible to push and steer a car.  The “damp from rinsing them” story fits someone who had just been fooling with pool gear, not with an automobile.  \n   • Donna, however, was sitting on the sofa in a bathing suit with “a towel wrapped around her and a pair of dirty sneakers.”  Sneakers are exactly what you would put on if you had to go out on red-hot pavement and lean your weight against a car.  Their being dirty shows she has already been outside and moving about.  Everyone else’s feet were bare or in flippers.  \n\n4. Opportunity.  Donna and Larry were the first to “go change.”  That gave Donna several free minutes while Tim was still in the kitchen talking to Mrs Kelly.  She could slip out the front door, put the car in neutral, and coast it downhill and round the corner.  A small compact from the early 1980s is light enough for one determined person to move alone.  \n\n5. Motive.  Nothing personal – the whole group planned a birthday prank in retaliation for Tim’s own practical jokes.  Any of them might have been willing, but only one actually did the deed.  \n\n6. Crucial observation.  When Tim finally says, “It looks like you are ready for swimming, and I know who moved my car,” the narrative states he is looking at Donna.  He has noticed exactly what we have – those sneakers are out of place on someone who claims to be waiting to leave for the pool.  \n\nTherefore Donna is the one who physically stole (rolled away) the car.  No one else needed to help her.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDavid Kelly, Nancy (surname not given), Larry Roberts, Donna Allen\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nDonna Allen\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Larry and Donna excused themselves first to “change.”  \n• Donna pulled on her bathing suit, wrapped the towel round her, and – crucially – laced up her old sneakers instead of going barefoot or wearing sandals.  \n• She let herself quietly out the front door, unlocked Tim’s compact (or simply opened the door), released the hand-brake, slipped the gearshift into neutral and pushed.  The street in front of the Kelly house slopes away, so once the car started rolling she could steer it down the block and around the corner out of sight – all without ever starting the engine.  \n• Donna walked back, perspiring a little and with dusty sneakers, but otherwise looking innocent.  \n• She re-entered the house, sat beside Nancy, and waited.  \n• A few minutes later David and Larry wandered outside for a legitimate errand (rinsing flippers) and then came back, giving the whole group a plausible reason for having been outdoors.  \n• When Tim finally stepped out and discovered the car missing, the prank was complete.  \n• Tim’s glance at Donna’s inappropriate footwear told him everything: she alone had the means (protected feet), the chance (free time while the others were still changing) and the tell-tale dirt on her shoes.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nDavid Kelly – Wearing flippers would make it practically impossible to walk any distance, much less push and steer a car.  His damp flippers are consistent with his story of rinsing them, not with rolling a vehicle away.  \n\nLarry Roberts – His brand-new, still-creased white T-shirt shows he had only just put it on; it is spotless and unsweated.  No shoes are mentioned.  He may have stepped outside briefly with David, but not to do anything strenuous.  \n\nNancy – She was barefoot when Tim saw her.  No one barefoot is going to stand on mid-afternoon asphalt pushing a car.  \n\nTherefore Donna Allen is the only person who both could and evidently did move Tim’s car.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
