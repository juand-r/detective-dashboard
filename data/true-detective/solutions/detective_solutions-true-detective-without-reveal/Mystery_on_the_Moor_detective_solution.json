    "full_text": "Bill Morris was in an expansive mood after the fine dinner we had just enjoyed. After the dishes were cleared, we sat by the fireplace. His eyes showed that he was far, far away. We were old friends, he and his wife Susan, and Mary and I. Mr. and Mrs. Tom Johnston, if you want a formal introduction. “It happened during our trip to Scotland last fall. We were anxious, Susan and I, to enjoy ourselves during this long-planned trip. So much so that when the recession hit, and things were a bit tighter than usual, we decided to go regardless. We knew that the money we spent would leave us with memories of our trip. It turned out that we returned with far more than that.” That got our attention. Mary was about to ask what had happened when Bill came out of his daydream and told the story, confidential-like. It struck me that had any strangers been present with us around the fire, the story would never have been told. “We were by the lakes, you know. Loch Lomond—that region, where there are treacherous moors as well—just like in the west of England, the Baskerville country. Yes, a man could get lost there.” We nodded, shivering a bit. “As a matter of fact, seven generations or so ago, one did!” Mary had to interrupt. “How did you find this out? And who was it?” “I followed the clues. You do so too, and see if you can tell me. But to begin with, of course you remember Susan’s maiden name, Susan Alice Macready?” Susan beamed with Celtic pride as I explained to Mary, whom I hadn’t known at the time of Susan and Bill’s wedding, “Of course! And at your wedding, nothing would do but we all wore formal Scottish attire, kilts, sporrans and all. There was a piper as well, playing as we gathered at the church.” “That’s right,” Susan said softly. “And now you’ll see, this was the trip I so wanted to take, to rediscover where my ancestor James Macready came from, so many years ago.” “It was in a little village, on the edge of the moors, quaint and folkloric in its way. It made me think of Brigadoon,” Bill said. “This was the town that James Macready had come from, so many years ago. Well anyway, we started up a conversation with the local innkeeper. We asked after the Macready family. “His answer astonished us. ‘They’re all gone,’ he said. ‘They died out many years ago. The last one was James Macready, who was lost on the moor. If you don’t believe me, take a look at our local churchyard cemetery. And there will be the records in the church office.’ “Amazed, we left the inn and walked over to the churchyard. It was just as the innkeeper had said. There were plots for a few families: Macready, Doone, Jenkins and MacGinnis. The last Macready was ‘James Macready, 1823–1844. Lost on the Moor.’ At our discovery of this grave, Susan gave a cry and nearly fainted. She had brought a copy of the family’s American genealogy, which began with the arrival of this very same James Macready in 1845. He had been born in Scotland in 1823, and died on the family farm in Pennsylvania in 1863, of wounds that he had received during the Civil War, at the First Battle of Bull Run, in 1861. It wasn’t possible that he had never come to America at all. If he had not, then just who did come and start the Macready family line in Pennsylvania?” “We stayed at the old inn, prolonging our visit, and talked with several locals with long memories. They remembered hearing the old stories from their grandparents, who had surely heard the same stories around the fireplace, like this one. The stories were memorized, with a detail or two added over the years for local color.” “Good thing it wasn’t a gas fireplace at that inn in Scotland,” I ventured. “That would upset the mood, I’m sure. Real stories require wood fires!” Mary shot a disapproving look at me, and Bill continued. “It seems that there were three suitors for a pretty—” “No, beautiful!” Susan interjected. Bill smiled. “Yes, a beautiful local girl named Lucille Doone. Whether this was the same family as that lawless one in the west of England, I can’t say. But they had something of the same rough and ready traditions. Her brother, Samuel Doone, always said that if anyone didn’t do right by his sister, that person would have to answer to him—and his hunting knife. “The suitors were James Macready, Tom Jenkins, and Jack MacGinnis. Their rivalry became well known—it was jealous and bitter. It was thought that Lucille Doone had made a choice, but if she had, she didn’t let on. Townspeople speculated that harm would come to the man whom Lucille chose, by the hands of those spurned. Rather than risk her beloved being killed, Lucille kept her own confidence. And so the mens’ rivalry continued. “Until the night James Macready was supposed to have been lost—for the locals spoke of it as though it had been no more than a week ago, and certainly within their living memory. There had been a country dance at a local farmhouse, and everyone was there. It was said that Lucille Doone would announce her choice of suitors then. The dancing to the fiddler’s tune was fast, and the time slipped by. Then came midnight, and the music stopped. Lucille Doone announced her choice—it was James Macready! “Jack MacGinnis left first. He grumbled about the lateness of the hour. He never went out without his dogs, and they could be heard barking as MacGinnis walked the half mile or so to his own farm. “James Macready left next. He was going straight over the moor, which everyone always said should never be attempted at night, it was that treacherous. But it was a full moon, and with the excitement, and a wedding now to think of, he wanted to put his affairs in order. He chastely bid Lucille goodbye and was never seen again. There was just the scarf that she had given him when she made her announcement—it was found tied to a tree branch along a pathway in the middle of the moor. That’s how the people knew what happened to poor James. “The last suitor to leave was Tom Jenkins. From the name, you will have suspected that he was an Englishman, and that he was, sure enough. Or rather, his grandparents were, when they had settled here. Now, English or not, we were told that you’d not find a better Scots family than the Jenkinses. Tom was hotblooded and a crack shot with his rifle, which he always carried with him. “Samuel escorted his sister home at the close of the dance, assuring that she made it safely. The next morning, Lucille kept waiting for her betrothed, James Macready, to call. He didn’t. And he hadn’t turned up at home, either. A search party was formed, for the daytime, of course. There seemed to be no clues for what had happened that quiet night on the moor. The search took five days, but finally, Lucille’s scarf was found and James was presumed lost. Lucille herself wore black at the funeral in remembrance of her lost love and the wedding that was never held. After a few months, Lucille heard from her aunt in Glasgow and moved there. It was said that the small village held too many sad memories for her to stay on. “That was that, except for the fact that suspicions were such that neither Tom Jenkins nor Jack MacGinnis could stay in the little town either. With Lucille gone to Glasgow, there just wasn’t any point in doing so. They did leave families here, and, it is said, wrote from time to time, but the letters were not saved, and a fire at the old library, which had housed records from the time, meant that nobody could be quite sure what had happened. “And so the legends began. And now it’s your turn. Perhaps you know, as Susan and I now do, just which man came to America under the Macready name and what happened on the Scottish moor so many years ago?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. The problem is not simply “Who killed James Macready?” but “Which of the three young men later appeared in America calling himself James Macready, and therefore what must have happened on the moor?”  Whoever turned up in Pennsylvania clearly had to\n    • be able to make a clean getaway,\n    • need a new name (--why travel under the very name of the missing man unless that solved a problem?),\n    • plausibly enlist in the Union army as an excellent shot,\n    • have a powerful reason to put an ocean between himself and Samuel Doone’s hunting knife.\n\n2. Timetable of the dance\n    • Jack MacGinnis (with his ever-present dogs) left first.\n    • James Macready left second, straight across the moor.\n    • Tom Jenkins left last.\n\n   Whoever attacked James therefore had to do it after James left the farmhouse; only Tom was known to be on the road after James.\n\n3. Means and opportunity\n    • Tom carried his rifle everywhere and was known as a crack shot – an easy, silent way to kill a man at night on open moorland.\n    • Jack’s barking dogs would have betrayed an ambush, and an excited pack is a poor companion for stealth.\n    • Samuel Doone was escorting Lucille home and was seen in the village; he could not have intercepted James without being missed.\n    • Lucille herself was with Samuel.\n    • James cannot be both the victim buried in Scotland and the emigrant who fought in the American Civil War; one or the other identity must be false.\n\n4. Why assume the victim’s name?\n    • If Tom Jenkins killed James in a jealous rage he had two very good reasons to vanish:\n         – to escape suspicion / the Doone revenge,\n         – to remove forever the English-sounding name “Jenkins” that instantly told every Scot in the district who he was.\n      Taking the dead man’s Scottish name solved both problems.\n\n5. Supporting clues\n    • Bill stresses that Jenkins was “hot-blooded” and “a crack shot with his rifle,” words that foreshadow the method of the crime and the later life of the man who fought at Bull Run.\n    • The American “James Macready” died of war wounds – exactly what one would expect if the emigrant was the expert marksman Tom Jenkins who naturally volunteered for the shooting war.\n    • Jack MacGinnis already possessed a good Scottish surname; stealing Macready’s offered him no benefit.\n    • If the real James had merely run away he would not have put Lucille through a sham funeral, nor would he have risked being charged with deserting her; besides, he alone had nothing to fear from Samuel Doone.\n\n   All of the logical arrows therefore point to Tom Jenkins.\n\n6. What occurred on the moor?\n    Tom, walking home after everyone else, overtook James on the moon-lit track, shot him dead, dragged or rolled the body into a peat hollow, tied Lucille’s scarf to a branch to make it look as though James had simply lost his way and died in the bogs, and went home.  As searchers found only the scarf, the village assumed “lost on the moor” and buried an empty coffin.  Realising suspicion might still fall on him, and dreading Samuel Doone, Tom sailed for America in 1845 under James’s name, married there, and founded the American Macready line.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTom Jenkins, Jack MacGinnis, Samuel Doone, Lucille Doone, James Macready (himself)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nTom Jenkins\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• 30 December 1844 (the night of the country dance).  \n  – Lucille Doone chooses James Macready.  \n  – Jack MacGinnis, furious, storms out first, his dogs’ barking soon fading toward his own farm.  \n  – James, elated, sets off across the moor, intending to reach his home the quickest way.  \n  – Tom Jenkins follows last.  Brooding and armed with his rifle, he overtakes James on the open moor.  \n  – In a fit of jealousy Tom shoots James, kills him instantly, drags the body into a peat sink, and covers all traces.  \n  – He ties Lucille’s scarf to a low branch on the track to make it look as though James lost himself in the treacherous ground.  \n\n• 31 December 1844.  When James does not appear, a search is organised; after five days only the scarf is found.  An empty coffin is buried and the stone “Lost on the Moor” is erected.\n\n• Early 1845.  Realising that suspicion may yet fall on him and fearing Samuel Doone’s promised vengeance, Tom Jenkins slips away from the village, boards a ship for America, and presents himself throughout the voyage and ever after as “James Macready, age 22, farmer.”\n\n• 1845-1861.  “James” marries in Pennsylvania, clears land and raises a family, doing nothing that might call him back to Scotland.\n\n• 1861-1863.  Still a superb shot, he enlists in the Union army, is badly wounded at First Bull Run, struggles on for two more years, and dies in 1863.  His widow and children perpetuate the name, unaware it was stolen on a moon-lit Scottish moor.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Jack MacGinnis – Left first with noisy dogs that would have announced his return to the moor; already had a respectable Scottish surname and so no motive to steal Macready’s; no record of a dog-loving Macready line in Pennsylvania.  \n• Samuel Doone – Was seen escorting Lucille home at the time James disappeared; had no motive to harm the man his sister had chosen.  \n• Lucille Doone – Was with her brother all night and genuinely grieved, never remarried, and moved away because of sorrow, not guilt.  \n• James Macready – Could not be both lost on the moor and simultaneously appear in America without anyone in Scotland ever hearing from him again; the cleanest explanation is that he was the victim, not the emigrant.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

      "mystery_text": "Bill Morris was in an expansive mood after the fine dinner we had just enjoyed. After the dishes were cleared, we sat by the fireplace. His eyes showed that he was far, far away. We were old friends, he and his wife Susan, and Mary and I. Mr. and Mrs. Tom Johnston, if you want a formal introduction. “It happened during our trip to Scotland last fall. We were anxious, Susan and I, to enjoy ourselves during this long-planned trip. So much so that when the recession hit, and things were a bit tighter than usual, we decided to go regardless. We knew that the money we spent would leave us with memories of our trip. It turned out that we returned with far more than that.” That got our attention. Mary was about to ask what had happened when Bill came out of his daydream and told the story, confidential-like. It struck me that had any strangers been present with us around the fire, the story would never have been told. “We were by the lakes, you know. Loch Lomond—that region, where there are treacherous moors as well—just like in the west of England, the Baskerville country. Yes, a man could get lost there.” We nodded, shivering a bit. “As a matter of fact, seven generations or so ago, one did!” Mary had to interrupt. “How did you find this out? And who was it?” “I followed the clues. You do so too, and see if you can tell me. But to begin with, of course you remember Susan’s maiden name, Susan Alice Macready?” Susan beamed with Celtic pride as I explained to Mary, whom I hadn’t known at the time of Susan and Bill’s wedding, “Of course! And at your wedding, nothing would do but we all wore formal Scottish attire, kilts, sporrans and all. There was a piper as well, playing as we gathered at the church.” “That’s right,” Susan said softly. “And now you’ll see, this was the trip I so wanted to take, to rediscover where my ancestor James Macready came from, so many years ago.” “It was in a little village, on the edge of the moors, quaint and folkloric in its way. It made me think of Brigadoon,” Bill said. “This was the town that James Macready had come from, so many years ago. Well anyway, we started up a conversation with the local innkeeper. We asked after the Macready family. “His answer astonished us. ‘They’re all gone,’ he said. ‘They died out many years ago. The last one was James Macready, who was lost on the moor. If you don’t believe me, take a look at our local churchyard cemetery. And there will be the records in the church office.’ “Amazed, we left the inn and walked over to the churchyard. It was just as the innkeeper had said. There were plots for a few families: Macready, Doone, Jenkins and MacGinnis. The last Macready was ‘James Macready, 1823–1844. Lost on the Moor.’ At our discovery of this grave, Susan gave a cry and nearly fainted. She had brought a copy of the family’s American genealogy, which began with the arrival of this very same James Macready in 1845. He had been born in Scotland in 1823, and died on the family farm in Pennsylvania in 1863, of wounds that he had received during the Civil War, at the First Battle of Bull Run, in 1861. It wasn’t possible that he had never come to America at all. If he had not, then just who did come and start the Macready family line in Pennsylvania?” “We stayed at the old inn, prolonging our visit, and talked with several locals with long memories. They remembered hearing the old stories from their grandparents, who had surely heard the same stories around the fireplace, like this one. The stories were memorized, with a detail or two added over the years for local color.” “Good thing it wasn’t a gas fireplace at that inn in Scotland,” I ventured. “That would upset the mood, I’m sure. Real stories require wood fires!” Mary shot a disapproving look at me, and Bill continued. “It seems that there were three suitors for a pretty—” “No, beautiful!” Susan interjected. Bill smiled. “Yes, a beautiful local girl named Lucille Doone. Whether this was the same family as that lawless one in the west of England, I can’t say. But they had something of the same rough and ready traditions. Her brother, Samuel Doone, always said that if anyone didn’t do right by his sister, that person would have to answer to him—and his hunting knife. “The suitors were James Macready, Tom Jenkins, and Jack MacGinnis. Their rivalry became well known—it was jealous and bitter. It was thought that Lucille Doone had made a choice, but if she had, she didn’t let on. Townspeople speculated that harm would come to the man whom Lucille chose, by the hands of those spurned. Rather than risk her beloved being killed, Lucille kept her own confidence. And so the mens’ rivalry continued. “Until the night James Macready was supposed to have been lost—for the locals spoke of it as though it had been no more than a week ago, and certainly within their living memory. There had been a country dance at a local farmhouse, and everyone was there. It was said that Lucille Doone would announce her choice of suitors then. The dancing to the fiddler’s tune was fast, and the time slipped by. Then came midnight, and the music stopped. Lucille Doone announced her choice—it was James Macready! “Jack MacGinnis left first. He grumbled about the lateness of the hour. He never went out without his dogs, and they could be heard barking as MacGinnis walked the half mile or so to his own farm. “James Macready left next. He was going straight over the moor, which everyone always said should never be attempted at night, it was that treacherous. But it was a full moon, and with the excitement, and a wedding now to think of, he wanted to put his affairs in order. He chastely bid Lucille goodbye and was never seen again. There was just the scarf that she had given him when she made her announcement—it was found tied to a tree branch along a pathway in the middle of the moor. That’s how the people knew what happened to poor James. “The last suitor to leave was Tom Jenkins. From the name, you will have suspected that he was an Englishman, and that he was, sure enough. Or rather, his grandparents were, when they had settled here. Now, English or not, we were told that you’d not find a better Scots family than the Jenkinses. Tom was hotblooded and a crack shot with his rifle, which he always carried with him. “Samuel escorted his sister home at the close of the dance, assuring that she made it safely. The next morning, Lucille kept waiting for her betrothed, James Macready, to call. He didn’t. And he hadn’t turned up at home, either. A search party was formed, for the daytime, of course. There seemed to be no clues for what had happened that quiet night on the moor. The search took five days, but finally, Lucille’s scarf was found and James was presumed lost. Lucille herself wore black at the funeral in remembrance of her lost love and the wedding that was never held. After a few months, Lucille heard from her aunt in Glasgow and moved there. It was said that the small village held too many sad memories for her to stay on. “That was that, except for the fact that suspicions were such that neither Tom Jenkins nor Jack MacGinnis could stay in the little town either. With Lucille gone to Glasgow, there just wasn’t any point in doing so. They did leave families here, and, it is said, wrote from time to time, but the letters were not saved, and a fire at the old library, which had housed records from the time, meant that nobody could be quite sure what had happened. “And so the legends began. And now it’s your turn. Perhaps you know, as Susan and I now do, just which man came to America under the Macready name and what happened on the Scottish moor so many years ago?”",
