    "full_text": "In the distance Abigail could hear gunfire from muskets and cannons. She did not shudder any more: these noises had become a way of life around the little town. Her father and two older brothers had joined the Continental Army as soon as the British had fired on Lexington. Many of the farmers and their sons from the small town had joined the ranks and left the women, children and elderly men to fend for themselves. But they had to fight for their freedom. Abigail's father had been a minister, in charge of a secret which he told Abigail one night before he left. Up the long flight of stairs he had taken her to the bell tower atop the assembly hall. Behind the locked door he told her were barrels of gunpowder and boxes of ammunition. Taking her gently in his arms, he told her to keep the secret. “I'm counting on you to watch it for me,” he said. “I know you are young, but we all must do our part in the war. I and General George Washington are counting on you.” “I will keep it safe for both of you,” she responded. But that had been weeks ago, and still the army had not come for their ammunition. Abigail alone had the key that would open the great lock on the door. She could not tell anyone. The rest of town was comprised of Tories that would try to take the supply away if they knew, so she did not tell anyone, not even her mother, lest someone overhear them. Only she would ring the bell to call the congregation to assemble. Alone, Abigail worried every time a thunderstorm rolled into the area. Would lightning strike the steeple? Shuddering, Abigail would try to push the thought away. She must not think like that. The day progressed slowly, the same as every Friday before had. They scrubbed the floors in the house and assembly hall, while Henry, a local drunk, kept himself busy fixing things around the house and hall. A Tory, Henry had worked for Mr. Smith in his locksmith shop before he had been fired for missing several workdays. His wife and young daughter had fallen ill and Henry had been unable to pay for a doctor – on the low pay he received – to travel to see them. Since there was no doctor nearby, his family died. He then turned to the bottle to forget, also upset at himself for not having asked for help. He let pride get in the way of his loved ones’ lives, but he really blamed Mr. Smith. Abigail's thoughts turned to Mr. Smith. Besides also being a Tory, Mr. Smith was a locksmith. This had always puzzled Abigail, since there was no high demand for a locksmith in the small town. Mr. Smith was the wealthiest man in town. However, because of Abigail's father's stand on the war, he refused to set foot in the assembly hall, never having been in there, to Abigail's knowledge. Later that Friday afternoon, Mr. Samuel paid a visit to Abigail and her mother. Mr. Samuel was the only other man besides Abigail's father who knew about the location of the ammunition. He had bought the supply and instructed her father to hide it for him. He looked knowingly at her, and she curtly nodded her head in acknowledgment. All was in order; she had checked the supply earlier that morning and would do so again before bed. He acknowledged her reply. “Good day Miss Abigail,” he stiffly bowed, his old body riddled with arthritis. Although dusty and tired from all the cleaning, Abigail's mother invited him in for tea. However, Abigail asked her leave to finish beating the rugs free of dust. As Mr. Samuel and her mother entered the house, Abigail began to whack the rugs. A moan interrupted Abigail. She paused, trying to spot its location. Again she heard it, coming from the bottom of the hill her house sat on. Running down the hill, Abigail was concerned about the person who had made that noise. As she made it to the bottom, she saw the figure of a soldier. A Continental Army soldier was lying face down in the tall grass. “Oh, Dear!” she cried as she knelt next to him. She turned him over, and was surprised to find the soldier was barely older than a boy. Blood oozed from a wound on his head. He was feverish and his eyes fluttered open when she supported him. “Do you know a Miss Abigail?” he asked, struggling to stay awake. “I am she.” “I had a message from your father, but ... it was stolen.” He raised his hand and touched his head. “Someone hit me and stole the message.” “Oh, dear!” Abigail said again, unsure of what to do next. “You need help, but we have to be careful,” she warned him, “The town is full of Tories. Can you stand and walk if I help support you?” The boy nodded, still winching from the pain. Abigail helped him to his feet and pulled his arm over her shoulder. Slowly they walked up the hill. Abigail kept a close watch on both the house and the town beyond them. They must not be seen! Once inside the assembly hall, she lowered the boy down on a pew. “I'll be back with some food,” she promised, hurrying from the room. Running to the kitchen, she grabbed some bread and milk as well as bandages and water for the boy's wound. He ate ravenously while she bandaged his wound. Afterward, she retired to bed. She slept fitfully, feeling she had forgotten something. A sound awoke her and she remembered. The ammunition in the tower had been forgotten. Silently she slipped out of her bed and grabbed the key that lay on the table near her bed. Not willing to light a candle, she felt her way to the tower in total darkness. Up the long stairwell, and into the lock she fitted the key. As she turned the knob, a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed her. She tried to scream and struggle, but the voice reassured her it was all right. It was the solder, so she relaxed. “What are you doing up here?” he inquired, releasing her from his grasp. Shuffling her feet, Abigail wondered what to answer. He must not know about the ammunition, or he would have told her, but she must not tell a lie. Quickly the boy acted, he pushed open the door, and walked in. Abigail was worried and followed, but to her surprise all the ammunition was gone! The barrels and boxes she had worried and kept watch over were gone! “Is something missing,” the soldier asked of her. \"Yes...but I know who took it.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who knew there was powder in the bell-tower?\n • Rev. (Father) – away with the army.  \n • Mr. Samuel – a Patriot who actually bought the powder.  \n • Abigail – had the only key.  \n No Tory should have known, so the thief must have learned the secret some other way.\n\n2. How could a Tory learn the secret?\n • From the messenger’s stolen letter.  \n  The wounded “boy–soldier” says a letter from Abigail’s father was taken after he was struck on the head.  \n  Therefore the attacker of the messenger and the thief of the powder are the same person (or working together).\n\n3. Who had the chance to attack the messenger?\n • The messenger was found at the foot of the hill that the assembly-hall and parsonage stand on.  \n • During that very afternoon Henry – the handyman – was working “around the house and hall”.  \n  He was the single Tory actually on the grounds and could easily have seen the courier approach, ambushed him, and dragged the body into the grass.  \n • Mr. Smith was in his shop on the far side of town (nothing puts him near the parsonage that afternoon).  \n • Mr. Samuel was taking tea with Abigail’s mother at the time and is a committed Patriot.  \n • The wounded youth himself is the victim, not the attacker.\n\n4. Who could open a massive lock without Abigail’s key?\n • A locksmith or someone trained by one.  \n • Henry had worked for Mr. Smith in the locksmith shop until recently – he has the necessary skill and tools.  \n • Mr. Smith is a locksmith too, but he “refused to set foot in the assembly hall, never having been in there, to Abigail’s knowledge.” Henry, on the other hand, was already inside the building all day and could work unobserved.\n\n5. When did the theft take place?\n • The powder was present when Abigail checked on it in the morning.  \n • That night, the room was already empty when she and the soldier entered.  \n • While Abigail was beating rugs, finding the messenger, tending him and then sleeping, Henry had hours of privacy in the hall.  \n  He could pick the lock, lower the kegs and boxes down the tower belfry ladder and roll or cart them away under cover of darkness.  \n  Because the big lock was still fastened when Abigail arrived with her key, we know it had been expertly re-locked – classic work of a locksmith.\n\n6. Motive\n • Henry is a Tory who has lost his family, is angry, penniless and alcohol–ruined.  Gun-powder is priceless to the British; selling (or simply gifting) it buys him drink, revenge on the town’s Patriots, and perhaps a reward from the Redcoats.  \n • Mr. Smith is already wealthy and publicly vowed never to enter the hall; the risk of breaking that vow for something he doesn’t need is small.  \n • Mr. Samuel wants the Patriots to receive the ammunition, not the British.  \n • The wounded youth is clearly on the Patriot side; his first question is for “Miss Abigail”.\n\nAll the essential clues (location of the messenger’s attack, locksmith skill, opportunity inside the building, re-locked door, Tory allegiance, need for money) converge on Henry.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nHenry ( surname not given ), Mr. Smith (locksmith), Mr. Samuel, The wounded Continental messenger\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nHenry  (the handyman and former locksmith’s assistant)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone known (he may later sell the powder to the British, but no named character assisted him in the story)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Early Friday: Abigail checks the bell-tower – powder and cartridges are still there.  \n• Mid-day: Abigail, her mother and other women clean; Henry, half-sober, is repairing things in both the parsonage and the meeting-hall.  \n• Afternoon: A young Continental courier approaches with a letter from Abigail’s father explaining the hidden ammunition.  Henry, working outside, observes him, ambushes him at the foot of the hill, stuns him with a blow to the head, steals the letter, and leaves him in the grass.  \n• Abigail soon discovers the wounded boy and hides him in the assembly hall, then returns to her house.  Henry, seeing Abigail occupied, reads the stolen letter and now knows exactly what lies behind the tower door.  \n• Evening / early night: When everyone is indoors, Henry picks the big lock (he still owns his locksmith tools) and hauls the kegs and ammunition crates down the stairs.  He re-locks the door to delay discovery and carts the powder away to a rendez-vous with nearby British troops (or to a hiding place until he can contact them).  \n• Late night: Abigail, remembering she has not checked the store, goes to the tower.  The messenger hears her and follows.  She opens the door with her key and finds the room empty – Henry has already made off with the entire cache.  Because Henry has slipped away into the night, only the empty room and the picked-and-relocked door remain.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMr. Smith – Although a Tory locksmith, nothing places him at the parsonage that day; he deliberately avoids the assembly hall, and would have needed insider access that only Henry had.  \nMr. Samuel – A Patriot who financed the powder and was drinking tea with Abigail’s mother while the messenger was attacked; his arthritis and age make lugging heavy barrels virtually impossible.  \nThe messenger – He is the victim of the assault, badly injured and unable even to stand without help when Abigail finds him; he has no key, no locksmith skill, and genuinely seems surprised the powder is gone.  \nTherefore Henry alone had motive, skill, opportunity and physical presence to steal the ammunition.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "“Who?” asked the soldier.\n“Only three men and knew about the supply of ammunition stored here,” Abigail explained. “But the locked door could have aroused suspicion.”\nShe told the soldier about the suspects and their backgrounds. “Mr. Samuel is ruled out because of his arthritis: He would be unable to move the barrels, even though he knew about the gunpowder.”\n“You are ruled out too, of course, because even if you had read the message you were bringing, you wouldn’t have moved the gunpowder. My father trusted you, so you are an honorable person.”\n“Why, thank you,” the soldier said, blushing slightly. “So it had to be Mr. Smith.”\n“It would seem so,” Abigail said. “He’s a Tory and a locksmith. And because my keys never left her, the lock would have had to been picked. However, Mr. Smith was being framed. As I told you, he has never set foot in the assembly hall, or climbed the tower, so he wouldn’t know about the barrels, let alone the locked door.”\n“It had to have been Henry. He’s a Tory and when he saw you, a Revolutionary soldier, he hit you on the head. After he read the message, which stated the army was to pick up the ammunition next week, he decided to make plans. He was going to frame Mr. Smith to repay him. He had worked in Mr. Smith's shop, so he knew about locks, and didn't need the key I carried around. When he saw me busy tending to you, he used that time to open the door and move the barrels down to his room. Later that night when I was in bed, he moved the barrels and boxes out to the shed. That was the noise I had heard.”\nHenry admitted to the crime and helped Abigail and the young soldier move the boxes back into the tower. Henry left soon after and traveled west, never to be heard of again.\nThe next week, Abigail's father came for the ammunition. He was very proud of the job she had done.\nNeither Abigail nor the young soldier ever told about the ammunition going missing.",

A Continental Army soldier was lying face down in the tall grass. “Oh, Dear!” she cried as she knelt next to him. She turned him over, and was surprised to find the soldier was barely older than a boy. Blood oozed from a wound on his head. He was feverish and his eyes fluttered open when she supported him. “Do you know a Miss Abigail?” he asked, struggling to stay awake. “I am she.” “I had a message from your father, but ... it was stolen.” He raised his hand and touched his head. “Someone hit me and stole the message.” “Oh, dear!” Abigail said again, unsure of what to do next. “You need help, but we have to be careful,” she warned him, “The town is full of Tories. Can you stand and walk if I help support you?” The boy nodded, still winching from the pain. Abigail helped him to his feet and pulled his arm over her shoulder. Slowly they walked up the hill. Abigail kept a close watch on both the house and the town beyond them. They must not be seen! Once inside the assembly hall, she lowered the boy down on a pew. “I'll be back with some food,” she promised, hurrying from the room. Running to the kitchen, she grabbed some bread and milk as well as bandages and water for the boy's wound. He ate ravenously while she bandaged his wound. Afterward, she retired to bed. She slept fitfully, feeling she had forgotten something. A sound awoke her and she remembered. The ammunition in the tower had been forgotten. Silently she slipped out of her bed and grabbed the key that lay on the table near her bed. Not willing to light a candle, she felt her way to the tower in total darkness. Up the long stairwell, and into the lock she fitted the key. As she turned the knob, a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed her. She tried to scream and struggle, but the voice reassured her it was all right. It was the solder, so she relaxed. “What are you doing up here?” he inquired, releasing her from his grasp. Shuffling her feet, Abigail wondered what to answer. He must not know about the ammunition, or he would have told her, but she must not tell a lie. Quickly the boy acted, he pushed open the door, and walked in. Abigail was worried and followed, but to her surprise all the ammunition was gone! The barrels and boxes she had worried and kept watch over were gone! “Is something missing,” the soldier asked of her. \"Yes...but I know who took it.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Henry; (b) Mr. Samuel; (c) Mr. Smith; (d) Young Soldier",
      "answer": "(a) Henry",
      "outcome": "“Who?” asked the soldier.\n“Only three men and knew about the supply of ammunition stored here,” Abigail explained. “But the locked door could have aroused suspicion.”\nShe told the soldier about the suspects and their backgrounds. “Mr. Samuel is ruled out because of his arthritis: He would be unable to move the barrels, even though he knew about the gunpowder.”\n“You are ruled out too, of course, because even if you had read the message you were bringing, you wouldn’t have moved the gunpowder. My father trusted you, so you are an honorable person.”\n“Why, thank you,” the soldier said, blushing slightly. “So it had to be Mr. Smith.”\n“It would seem so,” Abigail said. “He’s a Tory and a locksmith. And because my keys never left her, the lock would have had to been picked. However, Mr. Smith was being framed. As I told you, he has never set foot in the assembly hall, or climbed the tower, so he wouldn’t know about the barrels, let alone the locked door.”\n“It had to have been Henry. He’s a Tory and when he saw you, a Revolutionary soldier, he hit you on the head. After he read the message, which stated the army was to pick up the ammunition next week, he decided to make plans. He was going to frame Mr. Smith to repay him. He had worked in Mr. Smith's shop, so he knew about locks, and didn't need the key I carried around. When he saw me busy tending to you, he used that time to open the door and move the barrels down to his room. Later that night when I was in bed, he moved the barrels and boxes out to the shed. That was the noise I had heard.”\nHenry admitted to the crime and helped Abigail and the young soldier move the boxes back into the tower. Henry left soon after and traveled west, never to be heard of again.\nThe next week, Abigail's father came for the ammunition. He was very proud of the job she had done.\nNeither Abigail nor the young soldier ever told about the ammunition going missing."
