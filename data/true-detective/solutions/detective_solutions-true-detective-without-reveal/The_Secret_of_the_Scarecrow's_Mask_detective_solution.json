    "full_text": "Lightning flashed through the castle window, before the sky returned to darkness and rain. I trudged down the hallway, my candle flickering in invisible drafts from the stormy chill outside. Suddenly the candle lit up a face! \"Evening, squire,\" said Bertram, the care-taker. \"You startled me,\" I said, though I was glad he was there. I'd started to investigate the mystery of the scarecrow mask, and there were a lot of questions. It was a small Scottish castle, miles away from the nearest town. Behind a large wooden door in the front, I discovered the whole first floor was a single, enormous room. Dark stone staircases led on either side to an open second floor, which was filled with shiny armor from the Middle Ages. It felt like the ghostly bodies of knights, preserved for centuries and now left on display. Above that was a dark top floor, which Bertram had converted into rooms for guests. But unfortunately, he'd only attracted three paying customers. \"And now I've lost me prime exhibit,\" he wailed. Two of his guests emerged from their room - Mr. and Mrs. Winfrey. The elderly couple had heard our voices, and were wondering if Bertram was serving dinner. Mr. Winfrey was a large man who looked like he'd enjoyed many dinners. But Mrs. Winfrey just seemed unhappy to be so far from home, especially in a castle where it rained all day, complete with its own spooky mystery. \"I'll tell you how it began,\" Bertram said, as we gathered around a long wooden table downstairs. Bertram's son Chester had prepared a traditional dinner in the cook's quarters outside. As we munched on roasted chicken and potatoes, Bertram described a fierce battle that never was. \"The sheriff was searching for a dangerous outlaw,\" he said. \"He'd watched the roads, and searched the fields, and determined that he must be hiding here, in this very castle. He sent for the king's soldiers, who responded with 100 men, each armed with swords and spears. That dangerous outlaw would not escape their justice.” Lightning flashed outside. \"They searched the first floor - but he was not here. They searched every suit of armor - but he was not there. And then they searched the rooms on the third floor. But there was no trace of him. From dawn they searched, and through dusk they searched, but the outlaw was never found.” Mrs. Winfrey seemed confused, and she'd obviously never heard the legend before. \"Where was he?\" she asked. \"He was right here the whole time,\" Bertram warned. \"He watched them come, and he watched them go. At any time, he could've reached out and touched them.” \"He stood out in the field, in front of them, in plain sight. But he'd dressed himself as a scarecrow. All through the day he stood, arms stretched out on either side, like an innocent straw man propped up to frighten away birds.” We all laughed, and Bertram most of all. \"It's what made this castle famous!\" he chuckled, \"And I've loved that story since I was a boy.” \"When I came here I vowed I'd preserve what became known as 'the Castle of the Scarecrow,' along with its heritage,\" he said seriously. \"Amid all the armor upstairs, there's just one piece that the tourists will come to see - the mask of that outlaw scarecrow. \"But now it's gone!\" Silence filled the room, as we heard the rain beat against the door. \"That's outrageous,\" said Mr. Winfrey. \"We've traveled over 3,000 miles just to see that mask! My re-telling of that legend could make me a best-selling author.” Mrs. Winfrey added proudly that her husband was writing an exciting book about the history of famous outlaws, then sighed that she was just along for the trip. I wondered if she was miserable enough to sabotage the castle's prime exhibit. Bertram explained the crime. The scarecrow's mask stood on a pole at the center of the armor exhibit upstairs - as though surrounded by the armor of knights that it had fooled. Twenty minutes ago, shortly before opening the exhibit, Bertram entered the floor, only to see that pole standing conspicuously bare and empty. \"Maybe the scarecrow's ghost took it,\" said a sharp voice from the stairway. A well-dressed man descended, the third guest at the rainy castle. \"I'm proud of my family tree,\" said Charles Kincaid, defiantly. \"And of all the generations that went before, there was only one who achieved infamy in the pages of history. He was a sheriff - yes, that sheriff. And he lived the remainder of his life in disgrace for failing to catch that notorious outlaw. Everywhere he went, people whispered about his tremendous failure - outwitted by a silly mask and some straw.” There was more rain, and more lightning, as Charles entered the dining room. Anticipating my thoughts, he announced, \"No, I didn't steal the mask, but I wish I had. And I'll tell you one thing more. I hope you aren't able to find it, any more than my sheriff ancestor found your hidden outlaw.” Chester laughed at Bertram's obvious dismay as he carried in a pecan pie that he'd prepared in the cook's quarters, and I began the search for clues. It was eerie to stand surrounded by empty suits of ancient armor, but it soon paid off. Bertram and I discovered a trail of footprints that led to the stairs. Your thief came from outside, I told Bertram, who seemed surprised. \"But it's a cold, rainy, and windy night. Who would want to leave a cozy castle for an evening like this? I can't be sure, but I didn't notice any of my guests having wet hair.” Each guest agreed to let us search their room. Bertram searched through all of the bags that Mr. Winfrey had brought, along with his room, but there was no sign of the scarecrow's mask. And while Charles Kincaid had two fine suits hanging in his closet, a search of his room, his suits, and his pockets all failed to turn up the scarecrow's mask. \"Perhaps the king's soldiers have been fooled again,\" he sneered. If the thief hadn't traveled upstairs, perhaps he'd headed downstairs? There were no clues on the east staircase, but on the west staircase, my candle illuminated a strange, white scrap, which was wet and slimy. I tilted my candle to the floor, and discovered. . . a potato peel. As though having a second dinner, everyone gathered around the table downstairs. I announced I'd determined who'd stolen the scarecrow's mask.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive\n   •  Mr. Winfrey – would like the mask as a “prop” for the outlaw-history book he is writing.  \n   •  Mrs. Winfrey – no clear interest in the mask, only wants to go home.  \n   •  Charles Kincaid – would rather the mask vanish forever, so that the shame of his sheriff-ancestor can no longer be exhibited.  \n   •  Chester (the caretaker’s son and cook) – no obvious literary or emotional motive, but he alone could make money by quietly selling the mask, or could create a new “mystery” that would bring publicity (and therefore guests) to the almost-empty castle.  \n   •  Bertram – loves the legend; destroying his own prime exhibit would hurt, not help, him.       \n\n2. Opportunity\n   The narrator finds a single important fact: the thief came in “from outside,” leaving wet footprints that begin at the front door and climb the west staircase.  \n   On this stormy night no one had been outdoors—except Chester.  He works in a detached kitchen (“the cook’s quarters outside”) and must cross the rainy courtyard to bring dinner and dessert into the castle.  Everyone else had remained warm and dry inside; the narrator even notes that none of the guests’ hair is wet.\n\n3. Physical evidence\n   •  Wet footprints that start at the entrance: the shoes of someone who has just come in out of the rain.  \n   •  A wet, slimy potato peel on the west staircase.  The only person handling raw potatoes that night was Chester, who had just cooked a meal of roast chicken and potatoes.  A peel could easily cling to his soggy shoe or apron as he hurried inside.  \n   •  No incriminating objects found in the Winfreys’ or Kincaid’s rooms, or on their persons.  \n   •  No sign that anyone entered the armor floor from the east staircase; every clue is confined to the west staircase—-the one Chester would naturally use after pushing open the kitchen door.\n\n4. Logical deduction\n   •  Whoever stole the mask had to (a) come in from outside in the rain, (b) reach the second-floor armor hall via the west stairs, and (c) have been working with potatoes shortly beforehand.  \n   •  Those three conditions fit one person and one person only: Chester.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBertram (caretaker), Chester (cook), Mr. Winfrey, Mrs. Winfrey, Charles Kincaid\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nChester (Bertram’s son and castle cook)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring the afternoon Chester prepared dinner in the detached kitchen.  When the food was ready he crossed the windy courtyard, his shoes wet and messy, and pushed open the west door of the castle.  Before taking the platters to the dining room he hurried upstairs; there, in the dim light, he pulled the famous scarecrow mask from its display pole and hid it under his jacket.  (He planned either to sell it later or to stage a “miraculous recovery” that would draw press attention and guests.)  A bit of potato peel, stuck to the bottom of his shoe, fell off on the west staircase, and his rain-soaked soles left a clear trail from the front entrance up the steps.  He then carried the food to the diners as though nothing had happened and later returned the empty dishes to the outside kitchen, where he stashed the mask.  Twenty minutes later Bertram discovered the missing exhibit.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Bertram:  He was with the narrator when the footprints were found and showed genuine shock; moreover, destroying his own chief attraction would only harm his struggling business.  \n•  Mr. Winfrey:  Never left the warm interior and had no wet hair or shoes; the footprints prove the thief had just come in from the rain.  No mask was found in his many bags.  \n•  Mrs. Winfrey:  As with her husband, she stayed indoors and had no logical chance to acquire wet shoes or leave potato peels.  No motive beyond mild annoyance at travel.  \n•  Charles Kincaid:  Though he expressed a desire for the mask to disappear, his clothing was dry, his pockets empty, and there is no outside trail to or from his room.  The wet-footprint path implicates someone else.  \nTherefore the only person who meets every physical requirement of the crime is Chester, and the evidence clears the remaining guests.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I hope you aren't able to find it, any more than my sheriff ancestor found your hidden outlaw.” Chester laughed at Bertram's obvious dismay as he carried in a pecan pie that he'd prepared in the cook's quarters, and I began the search for clues. It was eerie to stand surrounded by empty suits of ancient armor, but it soon paid off. Bertram and I discovered a trail of footprints that led to the stairs. Your thief came from outside, I told Bertram, who seemed surprised. \"But it's a cold, rainy, and windy night. Who would want to leave a cozy castle for an evening like this? I can't be sure, but I didn't notice any of my guests having wet hair.” Each guest agreed to let us search their room. Bertram searched through all of the bags that Mr. Winfrey had brought, along with his room, but there was no sign of the scarecrow's mask. And while Charles Kincaid had two fine suits hanging in his closet, a search of his room, his suits, and his pockets all failed to turn up the scarecrow's mask. \"Perhaps the king's soldiers have been fooled again,\" he sneered. If the thief hadn't traveled upstairs, perhaps he'd headed downstairs? There were no clues on the east staircase, but on the west staircase, my candle illuminated a strange, white scrap, which was wet and slimy. I tilted my candle to the floor, and discovered. . . a potato peel. As though having a second dinner, everyone gathered around the table downstairs. I announced I'd determined who'd stolen the scarecrow's mask.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Charles Kincaid; (b) Chester; (c) Mrs. Winfrey; (d) Mr. Winfrey",
      "answer": "(b) Chester",
      "outcome": "\"I bet the thief is Mrs. Winfrey,\" teased Charles Kincaid.\n\"How could that be?\" I answered. \"When Bertram told the story of the scarecrow, she didn't even know the story about where the outlaw had hid!\n\"But we've also eliminated suspects by searching your rooms,\" I continued. \"We were able to deduce that none of the guests have the mask.\n\"And for that matter, the thief came from outside.” Eyes darted suspiciously around the room.\n\"And finally, the thief appears to have some familiarity with. . .”\n\"Potatoes,\" finished Bertram. The room was silent as his face lit up with understanding.\n\"Potatoes,\" echoed Chester. \"I hope you enjoyed them,\" he told the guests sheepishly.\n\"It must be cold and unpleasant, living in the cook's quarters in back of the castle,\" I said. \"I can't blame you for wanting to sabotage the tourist trade. But your shoes got wet just walking to the castle - and your left a trail of footprints that led from the scarecrow's pole.”\n\"If I'd known you were so unhappy, I could've hired a local cook,\" said Bertram gently. \"My only regret is you felt that you had to lie to me.\n\"Yours was the one room we didn't search,\" Bertram continued, now with understanding. \"I wondered why you laughed at dinner when Charles said that we'd never find the mask.”\n\"Perhaps the castle's new 'sheriff' was outwitted by his outlaw son,\" Charles teased.\nBertram stood for a moment, and then roared with laughter. And we all joined in."
