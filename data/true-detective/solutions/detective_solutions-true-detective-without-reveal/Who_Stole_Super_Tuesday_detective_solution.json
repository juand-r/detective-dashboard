    "full_text": "It was a chilly Tuesday in February, and Amy felt like everyone in America was watching her. She was voting proudly for a candidate to run for President. That election was nine months away, but the Democrats and Republicans both wanted to ensure they'd selected the best possible candidate for the race. Amy was one of millions of voters who'd vote today in a primary election indicating which candidate she'd prefer. The blue California sky seemed to be smiling on her. Amy knew she wasn't alone: twenty-two states were holding their primary today, and the newscasts were calling it \"Super Tuesday.\" But out of them all, the most votes would be cast in California. Amy walked across the college campus, still proud of the role she was playing. But someone was trying to cheat. \"It was on the internet,\" her friend Barry insisted. \"A web page showed instructions for hacking into the computers that store the votes.\" Amy was irritated at Barry, who was always telling her things he'd read on the internet. Besides, Barry was only a freshman, whereas Amy was in her second year at college. \"That couldn't happen,\" Amy insisted. \"The hacker would have to be alone with the computer.\" \"Only for a few seconds!\" Barry responded with excitement. \"They'd fake the results that they'd like to see, and store them on a special data drive. If they can get to the computer, they can insert their drive and replace all the original votes with fake ones!\" Amy didn't think that a hacker could try that trick without being spotted, but Barry sounded sure. \"I heard a prankster talking about it in the computer lab. He's going to have all his sneaky friends distract the workers at the polling place while he tries to hack its computer!\" Amy was alarmed. \"Do you know who it is?\" \"I'd never seen him before,\" Barry said. \"But if he was in the computer lab, he has to be a student here. I heard the conversation ten minutes ago, during my lunch break at noon. If we hurry, we can stop them!\" Two fraternity brothers rode past them on bicycles, each with a bumper sticker naming their favorite candidate. All around her were people hoping for someone to win. Could a hacker really interfere with America's democracy? Amy was struck by an idea. She told Barry to follow her to the science building, where the computer lab was on the second floor. Every student entering the room had to write their name on a sign-in sheet. \"We can figure out who you saw by checking the list!\" To the right of the computer lab's door was a low cardboard table, where a bored geek stood watching over the sign-in sheet. Amy said hello, but he didn't answer. He was wearing tiny earbuds in his ears so he could listen to music from his iPod. There were only three names on the list besides Barry's. He studied the list while Amy searched around for a pencil. The names on the list were: Ricky Churrelo \nXavier Ericksen \nSimon Knowles \"I've heard about Ricky Churrelo!\" Barry said. \"He's been talking about politics all month.\" Amy seemed interested, and they hurried towards the stairs that led down to the campus lawn. \"Ricky wrote an editorial for the school newspaper, saying that he thinks the best candidate is Ron Paul. Ricky's angry that his candidate didn't get included in some of the debates.\" By the door of the science building was an empty phone both, and Barry spotted a phone book inside. Turning quickly to the \"C\" page, Barry looked up Ricky's address. But had Ricky already left to try his trick at the voting booth? Amy and Barry started running past the green lawns of the campus. Ricky's dorm was like a cube, filled with long hallways of tiny rooms. Ricky lived on the fourth floor in room 45F. Barry knocked loudly on the door, then waited nervously. \"I'll know the hacker when I see him!\" Barry whispered to Amy. But unfortunately, it was Ricky's roommate who answered the door—Ricky wasn't there. \"Do you know where he is?\" Amy asked quickly. The roommate yawned. His hair was messy, and it was obvious he'd been taking a nap before Barry banged on the door. \"Ricky had a final exam this morning. He was going to study first in the computer lab, because then the test was going to last from ten until one.\" Suddenly, a silly song started playing loudly in the hallway. \"That's my cell phone,\" Barry said, a little embarrassed. Amy gave Barry an annoyed look as he opened the cell phone and began talking to one of his freshmen friends. But then she overheard Barry asking an important question: \"Do you know a student named Simon Knowles?\" There was a mysterious silence. \"No, Knowles,\" Barry repeated. \"With a K.\" Amy watched Barry's face, hoping to read the answer in his expression. Barry saw her gaze, and shook his head no. The door closed, and Ricky's roommate returned to his nap. Barry's face looked angry now. \"Yes, I still think that it's possible to steal votes in an election,\" he argued over the phone, \"and that's why I've been warning people about it for the last four weeks!\" Two students passed in the hallway, talking excitedly about their own favorite candidate, Barack Obama. \"What about Xavier Ericksen?\" Barry asked into the phone. His eyes lit up, and he turned his face to Amy, nodding yes. \"Xavier lives in the building next door!\" he told Amy. They rushed toward the elevator and rode down to the lobby. It seemed like everyone they passed in the dorm was also talking about the primary election. \"Xavier's in the same class as my friend,\" Barry explained as they hurried next door. \"And Xavier's very anxious for John McCain to be the Republican's candidate for President.\" Inside the dorm, Amy and Barry looked around. There was a list of the students and their room numbers, and Xavier's was on the first floor. This time Amy knocked on the door. No one answered at first, but there was music coming from inside. Suddenly the door swung open, and the doorway was filled by an enormous athlete wearing a bright football jersey. \"What do you want?\" he asked. Barry decided to let Amy do the talking. \"Is Xavier here?\" she asked. \"No,\" the athlete said, more politely. \"Right this second, he's with his tutor.\" \"Why does he need a tutor?\" Barry asked. \"He's not stupid, if that's what you're thinking!\" the athlete said defensively. \"He's really struggling in school, and it's making him really insecure, but he doesn't have any friends, so no one's helping him study. He needs to pass two tests this week.\" \"Do you know Simon Knowles?\" Amy asked him. Luckily, the athlete did, but unfortunately, Simon lived in a house on the other side of the campus. There was a shuttle bus which would drive past Simon's dormitory. Barry said he'd head over to the student center, where the polling station was set up for the students to vote. He'd watch for the hacker while Amy investigated Simon Knowles. Sitting on the bus, Amy had a horrible thought: what if Barry was the source of all this mystery? Maybe he'd invented this whole story about a voting conspiracy. It'd be just the sort of creepy thing a freshman might do to impress the older students. Simon lived off-campus, in a small house he'd rented with five of his friends. Amy knocked on his door, but no one answered. An old man watering his lawn next door said there was nobody home. \"Yes, Simon and five of his friends have rented this house, but about ten minutes ago, I saw them all leaving in a pickup truck.\" Amy stood on the sidewalk, knowing now was the time to protect everyone's votes. But who was behind this conspiracy to steal them? Suddenly, she knew the answer.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Time of the incriminating conversation  \n • Barry says he overheard the “prankster” in the computer-lab “ten minutes ago, during my lunch break at noon.”  \n • So the conversation took place very close to 12:00.\n\n2. Who could physically have been in the lab at that moment?  \n The sign-in sheet shows only four names for that time-block: Barry plus  \n  a) Ricky Churrelo  b) Xavier Ericksen  c) Simon Knowles  \n\n3. Checking alibis/opportunities  \n a) Ricky Churrelo – Room-mate says Ricky had a 10:00-1:00 final.  \n  • If the exam runs until 1 p.m. Ricky is still sitting it at noon.  \n  • Ricky had indeed been in the lab earlier to study, so his name is on the sheet, but he could NOT be the man Barry heard at noon.  \n b) Xavier Ericksen – The football player says Xavier “right this second is with his tutor,” and also volunteers that Xavier “doesn’t have any friends.”  \n  • No friends → doesn’t fit the plan that calls for “sneaky friends” to stage a distraction.  \n  • Being with a tutor gives him a current alibi.  \n c) Simon Knowles – No alibi is offered. An elderly neighbour says that about ten minutes before Amy arrived, Simon and “five of his friends” drove off in a pick-up truck.  \n  • That is exactly the number of helpers the hacker said he would use for a distraction.  \n  • Simon had been in the computer-lab around noon (his name on the sheet) and had time to rally his friends and leave.  \n  • He therefore had both the OPPORTUNITY to hatch the plot and the HELP needed to pull it off.\n\n4. Motive  \n The story never states Simon’s preferred candidate, but it does not have to: a determination to manipulate the primary is sufficient motive. Unlike Xavier (who is described as insecure and friendless) or Ricky (busy with an exam), Simon demonstrably has a support network willing to act.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n • Only one suspect (Simon) satisfies all three necessary conditions simultaneously:  \n   – present in the lab at noon,  \n   – free immediately afterwards,  \n   – possesses a band of friends able to stage the diversion.  \n • Therefore Simon must be the prankster / would-be hacker, and his five friends are the accomplices.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBarry (the narrator’s friend), Ricky Churrelo, Xavier Ericksen, Simon Knowles\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nSimon Knowles\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nFive unnamed friends/house-mates of Simon Knowles\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Early Tuesday morning Simon Knowles signs into the university computer-lab.  \n2. Around noon Barry is also in the lab and overhears Simon explaining to one of his friends how he can hack the voting computer: he will preload fake election data on a flash drive, then have his buddies distract the poll workers while he swaps the drives.  \n3. Simon leaves the lab, returns to the house he shares with five friends, and tells them it is time.  \n4. About 12:40 p.m. the six men pile into a pick-up truck and head toward the student-center polling station.  \n5. While they are en-route, Amy and Barry are still chasing red herrings; Simon expects them (and anyone else) to be distracted by Super Tuesday excitement while he tampers with the vote-tally computer.  \n6. Amy finally realizes that only Simon fits the facts: he has no alibi, he has the required group of helpers, and the timing of their departure matches the hacking plan.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Ricky Churrelo – Was sitting a three-hour final exam from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; could not have been in the lab at noon, nor had time to organize the hacking team.  \n• Xavier Ericksen – At the critical time he was with a tutor (supporting witness: the athlete); also described as having “no friends,” so he lacks the helpers central to the plot.  \n• Barry – Although he believes hacking is possible, he is the one who raised the alarm, and he left Amy only to stand guard at the polling place. He has no group of accomplices and nothing links him to the pick-up truck seen leaving Simon’s house.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He's going to have all his sneaky friends distract the workers at the polling place while he tries to hack its computer!\" Amy was alarmed. \"Do you know who it is?\" \"I'd never seen him before,\" Barry said. \"But if he was in the computer lab, he has to be a student here. I heard the conversation ten minutes ago, during my lunch break at noon. If we hurry, we can stop them!\" Two fraternity brothers rode past them on bicycles, each with a bumper sticker naming their favorite candidate. All around her were people hoping for someone to win. Could a hacker really interfere with America's democracy? Amy was struck by an idea. She told Barry to follow her to the science building, where the computer lab was on the second floor. Every student entering the room had to write their name on a sign-in sheet. \"We can figure out who you saw by checking the list!\" To the right of the computer lab's door was a low cardboard table, where a bored geek stood watching over the sign-in sheet. Amy said hello, but he didn't answer. He was wearing tiny earbuds in his ears so he could listen to music from his iPod. There were only three names on the list besides Barry's. He studied the list while Amy searched around for a pencil. The names on the list were: Ricky Churrelo \nXavier Ericksen \nSimon Knowles \"I've heard about Ricky Churrelo!\" Barry said. \"He's been talking about politics all month.\" Amy seemed interested, and they hurried towards the stairs that led down to the campus lawn. \"Ricky wrote an editorial for the school newspaper, saying that he thinks the best candidate is Ron Paul. Ricky's angry that his candidate didn't get included in some of the debates.\" By the door of the science building was an empty phone both, and Barry spotted a phone book inside. Turning quickly to the \"C\" page, Barry looked up Ricky's address. But had Ricky already left to try his trick at the voting booth? Amy and Barry started running past the green lawns of the campus. Ricky's dorm was like a cube, filled with long hallways of tiny rooms. Ricky lived on the fourth floor in room 45F. Barry knocked loudly on the door, then waited nervously. \"I'll know the hacker when I see him!\" Barry whispered to Amy. But unfortunately, it was Ricky's roommate who answered the door—Ricky wasn't there. \"Do you know where he is?\" Amy asked quickly. The roommate yawned. His hair was messy, and it was obvious he'd been taking a nap before Barry banged on the door. \"Ricky had a final exam this morning. He was going to study first in the computer lab, because then the test was going to last from ten until one.\" Suddenly, a silly song started playing loudly in the hallway. \"That's my cell phone,\" Barry said, a little embarrassed. Amy gave Barry an annoyed look as he opened the cell phone and began talking to one of his freshmen friends. But then she overheard Barry asking an important question: \"Do you know a student named Simon Knowles?\" There was a mysterious silence. \"No, Knowles,\" Barry repeated. \"With a K.\" Amy watched Barry's face, hoping to read the answer in his expression. Barry saw her gaze, and shook his head no. The door closed, and Ricky's roommate returned to his nap. Barry's face looked angry now. \"Yes, I still think that it's possible to steal votes in an election,\" he argued over the phone, \"and that's why I've been warning people about it for the last four weeks!\" Two students passed in the hallway, talking excitedly about their own favorite candidate, Barack Obama. \"What about Xavier Ericksen?\" Barry asked into the phone. His eyes lit up, and he turned his face to Amy, nodding yes. \"Xavier lives in the building next door!\" he told Amy. They rushed toward the elevator and rode down to the lobby. It seemed like everyone they passed in the dorm was also talking about the primary election. \"Xavier's in the same class as my friend,\" Barry explained as they hurried next door. \"And Xavier's very anxious for John McCain to be the Republican's candidate for President.\" Inside the dorm, Amy and Barry looked around. There was a list of the students and their room numbers, and Xavier's was on the first floor. This time Amy knocked on the door. No one answered at first, but there was music coming from inside. Suddenly the door swung open, and the doorway was filled by an enormous athlete wearing a bright football jersey. \"What do you want?\" he asked. Barry decided to let Amy do the talking. \"Is Xavier here?\" she asked. \"No,\" the athlete said, more politely. \"Right this second, he's with his tutor.\" \"Why does he need a tutor?\" Barry asked. \"He's not stupid, if that's what you're thinking!\" the athlete said defensively. \"He's really struggling in school, and it's making him really insecure, but he doesn't have any friends, so no one's helping him study. He needs to pass two tests this week.\" \"Do you know Simon Knowles?\" Amy asked him. Luckily, the athlete did, but unfortunately, Simon lived in a house on the other side of the campus. There was a shuttle bus which would drive past Simon's dormitory. Barry said he'd head over to the student center, where the polling station was set up for the students to vote. He'd watch for the hacker while Amy investigated Simon Knowles. Sitting on the bus, Amy had a horrible thought: what if Barry was the source of all this mystery? Maybe he'd invented this whole story about a voting conspiracy. It'd be just the sort of creepy thing a freshman might do to impress the older students. Simon lived off-campus, in a small house he'd rented with five of his friends. Amy knocked on his door, but no one answered. An old man watering his lawn next door said there was nobody home. \"Yes, Simon and five of his friends have rented this house, but about ten minutes ago, I saw them all leaving in a pickup truck.\" Amy stood on the sidewalk, knowing now was the time to protect everyone's votes. But who was behind this conspiracy to steal them? Suddenly, she knew the answer.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Barry; (b) Ricky Churrelo; (c) Simon Knowles; (d) Xavier Ericksen",
      "answer": "(c) Simon Knowles",
      "outcome": "Amy pulled out her cell phone and called Barry. \"You believe me, don't you?\" Barry wailed. \"There really is a hacker who's trying to steal votes!\"\n\"I didn't at first,\" Amy insisted. \"But during your phone call, it was obvious that you've been warning people about this for weeks—so it wasn't just a one-time lie to impress me.\"\nBarry pointed out another clue. \"If Ricky Churrelo had a test from ten til one, then he couldn't have been the student I saw in the computer lab. I was there at my lunch time, at noon!\"\nAnd Amy recognized the final clue. \"Poor Xavier Ericksen doesn't have any friends, according to his roommate. So if the conspiracy involves using sneaky friends to distract the poll workers, Xavier can't be behind it.\n\"But Simon Knowles left his house just a few minutes ago—and it looks like his five roommates headed out with him! Tell the poll workers to watch for Simon Knowles.\n\"Whoever's going to win this election, we want them to win it fair and square.\""
