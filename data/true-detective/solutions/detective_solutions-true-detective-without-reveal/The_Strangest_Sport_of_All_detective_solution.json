    "full_text": "Everyone laughed when they first met Ernie. He grew up on a farm, and was very friendly. He wore thick, nerdy glasses. And there was some truth to the impression his glassed gave. Reading was the only thing to do in his tiny hometown, and instead of sports in high school, Ernie played chess. He'd also earned college scholarships, and worked hard on his homework. And Ernie would soon solve a mystery about the strangest sport of all. Ernie didn't belong in gyms, but there he was, adjusting the weights to their lowest settings and exercising furiously. He seemed excited and determined, which made it difficult to get him to stop and talk, but the gym's manager, Gordon, struck up a conversation. Or at least, he tried to. Ernie wouldn't interrupt his workout for a second, but he handed the manager a flyer that he'd been carrying in his pocket all morning. As soon as he'd read it, Ernie had jogged for two miles, and then headed straight for the gym. In bold letters, the red flier announced: Chess boxing tryouts today. Ernie socked a punching bag -- though it looked more like a slap. The manager smiled, and said \"Kid, is this thing for real?\" \"It's a new sport,\" said Ernie, jabbing the punching bag fiercely, \"and it's the only sport I'll ever be good at.\" \"But it's chess and boxing?\" \"Is there something funny?\" Ernie said, throwing three punches at the bag. \"Why would you want to be a chess boxer?\" Ernie stood for a minute, looking scared but philosophical. \"Maybe I have something to prove.\" *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The rules of chess boxing are brutal. The chess players move their pieces for four minutes. Then, they start punching each other. It's a two-minute round of boxing, just like the professional boxers endure. But between every round of boxing – the opponents stop for four minutes of chess. \"This is the stupidest sport I've ever seen,\" said the gym's manager. \"Are you going to support me or not,\" Ernie said. He'd paid the gym for a membership, and paid extra for personal training. Every morning when the gym opened, Ernie showed up for boxing lessons. In all his years of managing the gym, Gordon had never seen a student so determined, but Ernie swore he knew a winning strategy. \"Listen,\" he said, \"the chess games go fast. If I can score a checkmate, I win both events -- it counts as a knock-out punch.\" \"And if you don't?\" asked Gordon skeptically. \"Then I only have to survive in the boxing ring for another two minutes.\" \"Or another four minutes, if you still can't finish the chess game. Or another six minutes. Or eight minutes. Or... \" \"I'll win the chess game,\" said Ernie. He sounded certain -- yet unconvincing. It was the voice of a young man who'd lived life behind nerd glasses. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The morning of the qualifying event, the gym was quiet -- too quiet. It was like the punching bags were dead, Gordon thought, but he wasn't worried about business. This was the first morning in four months that he hadn't given a boxing lesson. He missed the weird determination that Ernie always showed. And he missed Ernie. It all still seemed crazy. He couldn’t help but wonder if Ernie would win, or get clobbered in the ring. And then he knew what he had to do ... *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Ernie had never even seen a boxing ring, because he'd concentrated on learning how to duck. Gordon had showed him moves to protect his face and his gut, plus a clinch that was guaranteed to burn seconds off the clock. But the downtown gym was filled with real boxers -- fierce fighters with giant muscles. Ernie had never been punched by a boxer before. He was starting to worry. And that's when Gordon showed up. \"Still want to be a chess boxer?\" Gordon asked. Ernie didn't answer. Gordon looked at the boy with the glasses, and thought about the four months he'd spent at the gym. Then he went to the registration table to scope out the competition. \"Great news,\" he said to Ernie a few minutes later. \"These big guys you're looking at? They're here to try out for the Olympics. The chess boxers are over there!\" Gordon pointed towards the next room, which also had a boxing ring. It was a long, dark room with no windows or doors, except the one connecting it to the main boxing room outside. Under a sign that read \"Welcome chess boxers,\" they'd set up the official chess board on a table by the far wall, where two freshmen were sitting quietly, each studying a book of chess openings and wearing enormous eyeglasses. Both of them were skinnier than Ernie … *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* A referee was explaining the rules -- four minutes of speed chess, two minutes of boxing -- when the three chess boxers got some horrible news. A boxer strode in through the doorway -- one of the real boxers. \"The Olympic tryouts are over there,\" said Gordon, but the boxer didn't move. He was there for the chess boxing. And this terrified each one of the other chess boxers. The youngest of them was named Winston. He sang tenor in the glee club, and they'd dared him to try out for this event. Winston had never even seen a boxing match, and his strategy for the bout was to run. In his head, he'd imagined himself running for two minutes -- dodging behind his opponent, inventing new ways to duck -- and then beating them at chess. Now he wondered if that strategy would work, should he actually have to face a real boxer. On his right was a skinny, redheaded freshman named Jesse. Jesse had freckles and behind his glasses was a pair of calm brown eyes, which made him look either thoughtful or stupid. Gordon assumed that Jesse was stupid -- mainly because each one of these kids was about to get clobbered. If Jesse had thought seriously about the event, Gordon was sure that he would've stayed home. Was there any way to escape certain doom? The referee motioned to the real boxer, who joined the others on the bench by the ring. The real boxer had a name -- Mac -- and a hard face that seemed made out of stone. He never smiled, and he never said a word. And every chess boxer on the bench was terrified of him. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t*\n\t\t\t\nWinston went first, and was matched against Mac. After Winston's first move, Mac just stared at the chess pieces for a full 30 seconds, then finally did what Winston had done -- making exactly the same move on the opposite side of the board. \"He's just copying Winston's moves,\" Gordon whispered to Ernie. \"This guy can't even play chess. He just came here to beat you guys up! \" \"Then there's a sure way to beat him,\" Ernie whispered back, \"with a two-move opening that guarantees a checkmate.\" Winston played his best, but the gong sounded, and it was time for their first round of boxing. When it started, Winston immediately fled to the ropes, but Mac pinned him into a corner. Then he pummeled Winston mercilessly. Winston's nose started bleeding, and the ref separated the two boxers. When the match resumed, Mac slammed Winston's head with his boxing glove, and the glee club tenor dropped to the mat, unconscious. The match was over. It had lasted 41 seconds. They took a break to wipe the blood from Winston's nosebleed off of the boxing ring's canvas. The referee decided to move the next match to the other boxing ring, since the Olympic tryouts were almost over. The remaining chess boxers moved silently, each contemplating the fight to come, but they'd have to wait 10 more minutes until their boxing ring was free. The ref called Ernie's name. He'd be boxing Mac. Gordon looked at Ernie, and then looked at Mac, amazed that this moment had finally come. Ernie was reading a book of chess openings, and Mac hadn't even removed his gloves from the last fight. The moment of truth had arrived. Just then the ref realized that they hadn't brought the chessboard to the new ring. He asked Jesse to go and get it. But Jesse stopped in the doorway, and suddenly made a startled announcement: \"All 16 of its pawns are missing!\" The ref seemed annoyed, but Jesse was right. There was nothing in the other room but a boxing ring and chairs -- and the chess board where they'd left it, filled with half the usual pieces. All the other chess pieces were present -- each king and queen, plus the bishops, knights, and rooks. But there wasn't a single pawn. All 16 of them had been removed from the board. \"They were right here,\" said the ref. \"Someone must've stolen them,\" Gordon suggested. \"Is there another set of pieces lying around?\" \"Sure, I always carry a spare chess set with me,\" Gordon said sarcastically. \"But who'd want to stop the chess boxing fights?\" \"All of them,\" Gordon joked. The referee was annoyed, and accused Gordon of stealing the pieces. \"I was watching the door pretty closely, so I'm sure that at least you didn't go in that way. But I'm not sure you didn't sneak in there some other way.\" Then he leaned over to Gordon and whispered, \"And I wouldn't blame you. I wouldn't want my friend having to box this guy, either!\" \"Any one of us could've slipped in there,\" Gordon countered. \"They were all so busy studying chess openings or watching the tryouts.\" The referee was worried -- but fortunately, he'd already figured out who'd stolen the chess pieces.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1 . Motive  \n•  Mac – wants to fight, not to cancel the bout.  No reason to stop the chess part.  \n•  Ernie – believes he can win at chess in two moves; taking the pawns destroys his own plan, so no motive.  \n•  Jesse – is frightened, but if the event is cancelled he never becomes an official chess-boxer (the only reason he came).  Weak motive.  \n•  Gordon – is the one person who really cares what happens to Ernie.  After watching Winston’s beating he knows Ernie will be hurt, so he has a strong motive to see that the match never starts.\n\n2 . Opportunity  \nThe pawns were still on the board during the 4-minute chess session.  \nThey had disappeared by the time Jesse was sent to fetch the set.  \nWhile Winston was being pummelled (41 seconds) everybody’s attention was fixed on the ring.  \nOnly three people were free to walk over to the chess table at that moment: Gordon, Ernie and Jesse (Mac was boxing, Winston was boxing, the referee was refereeing).  \nOf those three, Gordon was the only one who later had both hands free and pockets big enough to hide sixteen pawns; Mac still had his gloves on, and a man in boxing gloves simply cannot pick up sixteen tiny chess-men.  \n\n3 . Physical / behavioural clues  \n•  When the referee asked whether another set was available, Gordon answered instantly and sarcastically (“Sure, I always carry a spare chess set with me”).  That is exactly what a saboteur who knows there is no replacement would say.  \n•  The referee tells Gordon: “I was watching the door pretty closely, so I’m sure that at least you didn’t go in that way.”  In other words, no one re-entered the first room after they all left it.  The theft therefore had to happen while they were still in the room – i.e. during the 41-second boxing round.  \n•  During those 41 seconds Gordon had nothing to do but watch.  Ernie and Jesse were still seated on the bench reading their opening books; the text states Ernie was “reading a book of chess openings” when the ten-minute wait began, which matches his having stayed on the bench.  Gordon, on the other hand, is never described as sitting; he could easily stroll to the far wall and scoop up the pawns.  \n\n4 . Logical deduction  \n•  The thief needed both the opportunity (hands free, time when no one was looking) and a strong motive (prevent Ernie from being hurt).  \n•  Only Gordon satisfies both conditions.  \n\nTherefore Gordon is the pawn-thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nErnie, Gordon, Jesse, Mac, Winston, Referee\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nGordon (manager of the gym)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhile Winston and Mac were in the ring, the referee, the other two competitors and Gordon stood at the edge of the mat, their eyes glued to the brutal 41-second mismatch.  \nGordon, terrified by what he was seeing and realising that Ernie would be next, walked quietly across to the chess table by the far wall.  In two quick sweeps of his hands he collected all sixteen pawns, slipped them into his pocket and returned to his place before Winston hit the canvas.  \nA few minutes later everyone left the room to move to the other ring.  No one re-entered that room until Jesse was sent to fetch the chessboard – and, of course, the pawns were gone.  \nBecause there was no spare set the referee had to suspend the contest, thereby saving Ernie from facing the stone-fisted Mac.  Gordon achieved exactly what he wanted: the fight could not go on.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nErnie – Removing the pawns destroys the two-move check-mate he had just explained to Gordon; it would rob him of his only chance to win.  \n\nJesse – Had the same opportunity, but no compelling motive; besides, he was the one who first reported the missing pieces, something a thief is unlikely to do when he is the only person entering the room.  \n\nMac – Still wore his boxing gloves; picking up sixteen small pawns would have been virtually impossible.  He also wanted the fight to continue, not be cancelled.  \n\nWinston – Was unconscious when the theft could have been committed.  \n\nReferee – Was on duty in the ring during the 41-second bout and watching the doorway afterwards; he had neither motive nor chance.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

They took a break to wipe the blood from Winston's nosebleed off of the boxing ring's canvas. The referee decided to move the next match to the other boxing ring, since the Olympic tryouts were almost over. The remaining chess boxers moved silently, each contemplating the fight to come, but they'd have to wait 10 more minutes until their boxing ring was free. The ref called Ernie's name. He'd be boxing Mac. Gordon looked at Ernie, and then looked at Mac, amazed that this moment had finally come. Ernie was reading a book of chess openings, and Mac hadn't even removed his gloves from the last fight. The moment of truth had arrived. Just then the ref realized that they hadn't brought the chessboard to the new ring. He asked Jesse to go and get it. But Jesse stopped in the doorway, and suddenly made a startled announcement: \"All 16 of its pawns are missing!\" The ref seemed annoyed, but Jesse was right. There was nothing in the other room but a boxing ring and chairs -- and the chess board where they'd left it, filled with half the usual pieces. All the other chess pieces were present -- each king and queen, plus the bishops, knights, and rooks. But there wasn't a single pawn. All 16 of them had been removed from the board. \"They were right here,\" said the ref. \"Someone must've stolen them,\" Gordon suggested. \"Is there another set of pieces lying around?\" \"Sure, I always carry a spare chess set with me,\" Gordon said sarcastically. \"But who'd want to stop the chess boxing fights?\" \"All of them,\" Gordon joked. The referee was annoyed, and accused Gordon of stealing the pieces. \"I was watching the door pretty closely, so I'm sure that at least you didn't go in that way. But I'm not sure you didn't sneak in there some other way.\" Then he leaned over to Gordon and whispered, \"And I wouldn't blame you. I wouldn't want my friend having to box this guy, either!\" \"Any one of us could've slipped in there,\" Gordon countered. \"They were all so busy studying chess openings or watching the tryouts.\" The referee was worried -- but fortunately, he'd already figured out who'd stolen the chess pieces.",

They're the tiniest pieces on the board -- and you counted them all from the doorway?\"\nGordon pointed out that the chess set was on the far wall across the room, and that Jesse had instantly known how many pieces were missing while he was standing in the door. Jesse's face turned bright red -- almost matching his hair -- and he admitted: \"I just didn't want to get beat up.\"\nFortunately, no one got beat up. Ernie won Mac in just two moves in their chess game -- and then Mac suddenly ran out of the building, too embarrassed to fight anyone!",

      "mystery_text": "Everyone laughed when they first met Ernie. He grew up on a farm, and was very friendly. He wore thick, nerdy glasses. And there was some truth to the impression his glassed gave. Reading was the only thing to do in his tiny hometown, and instead of sports in high school, Ernie played chess. He'd also earned college scholarships, and worked hard on his homework. And Ernie would soon solve a mystery about the strangest sport of all. Ernie didn't belong in gyms, but there he was, adjusting the weights to their lowest settings and exercising furiously. He seemed excited and determined, which made it difficult to get him to stop and talk, but the gym's manager, Gordon, struck up a conversation. Or at least, he tried to. Ernie wouldn't interrupt his workout for a second, but he handed the manager a flyer that he'd been carrying in his pocket all morning. As soon as he'd read it, Ernie had jogged for two miles, and then headed straight for the gym. In bold letters, the red flier announced: Chess boxing tryouts today. Ernie socked a punching bag -- though it looked more like a slap. The manager smiled, and said \"Kid, is this thing for real?\" \"It's a new sport,\" said Ernie, jabbing the punching bag fiercely, \"and it's the only sport I'll ever be good at.\" \"But it's chess and boxing?\" \"Is there something funny?\" Ernie said, throwing three punches at the bag. \"Why would you want to be a chess boxer?\" Ernie stood for a minute, looking scared but philosophical. \"Maybe I have something to prove.\" *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The rules of chess boxing are brutal. The chess players move their pieces for four minutes. Then, they start punching each other. It's a two-minute round of boxing, just like the professional boxers endure. But between every round of boxing – the opponents stop for four minutes of chess. \"This is the stupidest sport I've ever seen,\" said the gym's manager. \"Are you going to support me or not,\" Ernie said. He'd paid the gym for a membership, and paid extra for personal training. Every morning when the gym opened, Ernie showed up for boxing lessons. In all his years of managing the gym, Gordon had never seen a student so determined, but Ernie swore he knew a winning strategy. \"Listen,\" he said, \"the chess games go fast. If I can score a checkmate, I win both events -- it counts as a knock-out punch.\" \"And if you don't?\" asked Gordon skeptically. \"Then I only have to survive in the boxing ring for another two minutes.\" \"Or another four minutes, if you still can't finish the chess game. Or another six minutes. Or eight minutes. Or... \" \"I'll win the chess game,\" said Ernie. He sounded certain -- yet unconvincing. It was the voice of a young man who'd lived life behind nerd glasses. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The morning of the qualifying event, the gym was quiet -- too quiet. It was like the punching bags were dead, Gordon thought, but he wasn't worried about business. This was the first morning in four months that he hadn't given a boxing lesson. He missed the weird determination that Ernie always showed. And he missed Ernie. It all still seemed crazy. He couldn’t help but wonder if Ernie would win, or get clobbered in the ring. And then he knew what he had to do ... *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Ernie had never even seen a boxing ring, because he'd concentrated on learning how to duck. Gordon had showed him moves to protect his face and his gut, plus a clinch that was guaranteed to burn seconds off the clock. But the downtown gym was filled with real boxers -- fierce fighters with giant muscles. Ernie had never been punched by a boxer before. He was starting to worry. And that's when Gordon showed up. \"Still want to be a chess boxer?\" Gordon asked. Ernie didn't answer. Gordon looked at the boy with the glasses, and thought about the four months he'd spent at the gym. Then he went to the registration table to scope out the competition. \"Great news,\" he said to Ernie a few minutes later. \"These big guys you're looking at? They're here to try out for the Olympics. The chess boxers are over there!\" Gordon pointed towards the next room, which also had a boxing ring. It was a long, dark room with no windows or doors, except the one connecting it to the main boxing room outside. Under a sign that read \"Welcome chess boxers,\" they'd set up the official chess board on a table by the far wall, where two freshmen were sitting quietly, each studying a book of chess openings and wearing enormous eyeglasses. Both of them were skinnier than Ernie … *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* A referee was explaining the rules -- four minutes of speed chess, two minutes of boxing -- when the three chess boxers got some horrible news. A boxer strode in through the doorway -- one of the real boxers. \"The Olympic tryouts are over there,\" said Gordon, but the boxer didn't move. He was there for the chess boxing. And this terrified each one of the other chess boxers. The youngest of them was named Winston. He sang tenor in the glee club, and they'd dared him to try out for this event. Winston had never even seen a boxing match, and his strategy for the bout was to run. In his head, he'd imagined himself running for two minutes -- dodging behind his opponent, inventing new ways to duck -- and then beating them at chess. Now he wondered if that strategy would work, should he actually have to face a real boxer. On his right was a skinny, redheaded freshman named Jesse. Jesse had freckles and behind his glasses was a pair of calm brown eyes, which made him look either thoughtful or stupid. Gordon assumed that Jesse was stupid -- mainly because each one of these kids was about to get clobbered. If Jesse had thought seriously about the event, Gordon was sure that he would've stayed home. Was there any way to escape certain doom? The referee motioned to the real boxer, who joined the others on the bench by the ring. The real boxer had a name -- Mac -- and a hard face that seemed made out of stone. He never smiled, and he never said a word. And every chess boxer on the bench was terrified of him. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t*\n\t\t\t\nWinston went first, and was matched against Mac. After Winston's first move, Mac just stared at the chess pieces for a full 30 seconds, then finally did what Winston had done -- making exactly the same move on the opposite side of the board. \"He's just copying Winston's moves,\" Gordon whispered to Ernie. \"This guy can't even play chess. He just came here to beat you guys up! \" \"Then there's a sure way to beat him,\" Ernie whispered back, \"with a two-move opening that guarantees a checkmate.\" Winston played his best, but the gong sounded, and it was time for their first round of boxing. When it started, Winston immediately fled to the ropes, but Mac pinned him into a corner. Then he pummeled Winston mercilessly. Winston's nose started bleeding, and the ref separated the two boxers. When the match resumed, Mac slammed Winston's head with his boxing glove, and the glee club tenor dropped to the mat, unconscious. The match was over. It had lasted 41 seconds.
