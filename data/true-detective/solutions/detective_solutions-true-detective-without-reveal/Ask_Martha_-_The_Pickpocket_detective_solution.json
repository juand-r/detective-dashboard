    "full_text": "There I was, enjoying a cup of coffee at the Lonesome Polecat Cafe, the western themed coffee house that was Centerville’s not very adequate answer to Cheyenne. Inspector Samuels of the Centerville Police entered the swinging tavern doors, narrowed his eyes at the darkened interior and squinted my way, then came charging towards my corner table like a halfback in search of paydirt in the last quarter. “So there you are, Crusher!” he said. “Your office said I’d find you here.” “So I am, Inspector. Wouldn’t it be easier if you carried a cell phone, like everyone else in town?” “Well maybe, but then I wouldn’t have any excuse to settle in here for a morning break and have a cup of coffee. As you are doing now.” Sally the waitress sidled over, took his coffee order, brought a steaming mug, and left. “Is this a case for Crusher Davis or Ask Martha?” (In other words, do you want my help directly, or do I use my advice to the lovelorn column in the Chronicle to get clues?) “You decide, Crusher. It’s that rash of thefts we’ve been having recently. There seems to be a pattern developing. I think we are dealing with a pickpocket. Maybe some of your readers would have noticed something, if you could survey them carefully. Or perhaps, you could get some information that would help us solve the case. Frankly, something about it doesn’t make any sense to me.” I trusted his instinct. “So, if Martha finds out who did it, that may make it unofficial.” “That’s about it, yes.” “Tell me about any recent cases.” “Sure,” Inspector Samuels began. “On Tuesday afternoon, Sam Cartwright’s wallet was lifted when he went shopping at our Home Depot. The money was taken, but the credit cards were not touched. The wallet was found in the parking lot.” “Sounds like the thief, if there was one, could have made more money by using the credit cards.” “Sure, but this isn’t New York City. It’s Centerville, after all, and Sam is well known. At 6 foot 5, and 240 pounds, he is almost as big as you are, Crusher.” He added, “You know, the same thing happened to Charley Eastern at the Safeway last week. I hadn’t put it together. The difference was that he found his wallet on the floor near the checkout cashier and nothing had been taken from it. But you know how he is, almost uncoordinated. He can’t put on his trousers without knocking a lamp over! So I didn’t make anything of it.” “Funny. Any more cases?” “Yes, just now, Mayor Greenleaf had his wallet stolen. He was at The Elegant Jewelry Shop picking out a present for Mrs. Greenleaf for their anniversary. Same story. He checked his wallet, and it wasn’t there. It was found outside the store on the sidewalk, cash gone, everything else still in the wallet.” “How about suspects?” “That’s too strong a word. But four high school students were very close to where the incidents took place. They are Sarah Browne, Morris Emerson, Johnny Anderson and Tom Blankenship.” “You mean, Inspector, that each of the four was at each one of the three incidents?” “Yes. Well, not exactly. Sarah was at the movies when Charley Eastern was shopping at the Safeway. But Johnny Anderson and Morris Emerson were in the Safeway when it happened, and Charley says he saw Tom Blankenship leaving the Safeway exit door for the parking lot just before he left the store.” “What about the other two incidents, when money was actually taken?” “All four were together on a class project at The Elegant Jewelry Shop when Mayor Greenleaf was there. They were ordering an engraved pair of cuff links for Coach Johnson. He did have a great football season this year, after all - the best since you used to captain the team “So they were all together?” “Yes.” “Was the Mayor wearing a jacket?” “Yes. I know where you are going. The wallet, he said, was in the inside right pocket.” “Were the four inside the store when he arrived?” “Sarah, Morris and Johnny were already inside the jewelry store while Tom had been parking the car and followed the Mayor into the jewelry store.” “Who left the jewelry store first?” “Mayor Greenleaf did. That’s when he found his wallet on the sidewalk and called me.” “And the Sam Cartwright theft at Home Depot?” “He told me that he saw all four youngsters in the store when he was shopping.” “Does he remember where they were in the store?” “Yes. Johnny was having an argument a few aisles away with another customer, and they were pretty loud. It seems that there was only one electric sander left in stock and each wanted it. Morris went over when he heard the argument and tried to calm things down.” “What about Sarah and Tom?” “They were the next customers after Sam Cartwright at the checkout counter.” “Anything else?” “No. That’s it. And I am afraid it is pretty thin.” “You said it. I’ll ask a few questions and try to get some answers, without anybody’s reputation being damaged.” “Yes, Crusher, that’s the tough part. Many thanks.” He finished his coffee and left. My “Ask Martha” column in the Chronicle the next day asked for help from high school students in solving a baffling crime wave. Many students emailed me to help. That included Sarah Browne, so I called her on my cell phone, and we met after her classes. “I’m so glad you are looking into this,” she said. “We all read your Ask Martha column, and everyone remembers when you played football here. We trust you. And frankly, the whole thing has just gone too far.” “What? You mean these thefts?” “Yes. The four of us thought it would be fun, and none of the money was spent, of course.” She gave me an envelope containing the money from the wallets of Mayor Greenleaf and Sam Cartwright, carefully counted, with a paper signed by her and the other three students. “But I guess our little joke went too far. You see, we are all in drama class, and we are putting on ‘Oliver Twist’ at the high school next month. I play Nancy of course, Tom is the Artful Dodger, Morris is Fagin and Johnny is Oliver Twist. We had practiced the pickpocket scenes, and then someone had the idea, ‘Why not actually do it? It would make great publicity for our play, and we’ll give the money back on opening night!’” “When your column came out, we saw things had already gone too far. Nobody made the connection between the play and the thefts. Anyway, I must confess, I haven’t been sleeping very well since this all began! And so our signed ‘confession’ was mailed to Inspector Samuels yesterday, before your column appeared.” “Well, he hadn’t opened it when he talked with me. What did you confess?” “We explained what we had done, and that we had the money to be returned immediately.” “Fair enough. But something is missing. If all four of you took the wallets, there is no mystery. On the other hand, I think just one of your little group actually took the wallets, so the mystery then becomes - which one of the four of you was the pickpocket?” “That’s it exactly!” “I know who it was,” Crusher said. “And if you can get your three friends here quickly, I’ll ask Inspector Samuels to join us. Prepare for a lecture, but I’m hopeful that with Ask Martha on your side, he’ll let you off and persuade Sam Cartwright and Mayor Greenleaf not to press criminal charges. Who knows, maybe there will be a publicity angle for the play after all!” She breathed a sigh of relief and called her three friends. “From now on, we’ll leave crime and detection to you and the police force,” she said.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. We are told that only one of the four drama-club students is really picking pockets – the other three are innocent hangers-on who thought the whole thing was harmless publicity.\n\n2. There are three incidents to compare.\n\n   • Safeway ( Charley Eastern )  \n     – Wallet merely fell to the floor, nothing taken.  \n     – Present: Johnny, Morris, Tom.  \n     – Absent: Sarah.\n\n   • Home Depot ( Sam Cartwright )  \n     – Wallet stolen, cash removed, wallet later found outside.  \n     – Present: Sarah, Johnny, Morris, Tom.\n\n   • Elegant Jewelry Shop ( Mayor Greenleaf )  \n     – Wallet stolen, cash removed, wallet later found outside.  \n     – Present: Sarah, Johnny, Morris, Tom.\n\n3. If only one youngster is the real pickpocket, the simplest way to find him or her is to see whose presence always coincides with a successful theft and whose absence coincides with the absence of a theft.\n\n   • Johnny, Morris and Tom were on the scene all three times, but a theft happened only twice.  \n     → Therefore none of them can be the lone thief; their mere presence does not guarantee a theft.\n\n   • Sarah was present on the two occasions when money disappeared and absent on the sole occasion when no money disappeared.  \n     → Her presence correlates perfectly with the crimes; her absence correlates with the absence of a crime.\n\n4. Opportunity:\n\n   • Home Depot – Sarah was standing directly behind the victim at the checkout counter, the classic position for a lift as the victim returns the wallet to his pocket and starts to leave.  \n   • Jewelry Shop – When Mayor Greenleaf entered, Sarah was already in the store and could brush past him as the group crowded around the counter. She had a much easier route to the mayor’s inside jacket pocket than Tom, who was still coming through the doorway.\n\n   In both cases Sarah could slip outside a moment later, remove the cash, and drop the wallet where it was later found.\n\n5. Motive:  Sarah is playing Nancy in “Oliver Twist.”  Nancy is not a pickpocket but she is the protector of Oliver and the only major female in the gang.  That makes Sarah the natural “promoter” of the stunt among her classmates while not automatically pointing suspicion at her.  Her acting skills make her a good hand-in-pocket artist as well.\n\n6. Physical evidence:  Nothing except the fact that the two stripped wallets were both dropped outside – exactly where someone who had just left the check-out line or stepped out for a breath of air would discard them.  Sarah was standing or moving through the exit area on both occasions.\n\n7. Logical deduction:  Since one and only one student is guilty, correlation equals causation here – the thefts follow Sarah around and stop when she is elsewhere.  Therefore Sarah must be the pickpocket.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSarah Browne, Morris Emerson, Johnny Anderson, Tom Blankenship\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nSarah Browne\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Last week at the Safeway Sarah was at the movies.  Charley Eastern, famous for his clumsiness, simply dropped his own wallet while paying.  Johnny, Morris and Tom happened to be on the scene, which is why the police linked the youngsters to the incident even though no crime actually occurred.\n\n• The trio later told Sarah about the coincidence.  She realised it would be easy publicity for their forthcoming production of “Oliver Twist” if a real pick-pocketing took place and the money were theatrically returned on opening night.  She decided to try her hand without breathing a word to the boys.\n\n• Tuesday afternoon in Home Depot Sarah stood directly behind giant Sam Cartwright at the checkout while Tom waited with her.  As Sam stuffed his wallet back into his pocket and hoisted his bag, Sarah lifted it, followed Sam into the parking lot, removed the cash, and tossed the wallet to the pavement.  She re-joined her friends, who never suspected anything.\n\n• The next day all four drama students visited the Elegant Jewelry Shop.  Sarah was already inside chatting with Johnny and Morris when Mayor Greenleaf walked in.  While everyone crowded around the counter Sarah brushed against the mayor, slipped her hand inside his jacket, and removed the wallet.  She then stepped outside “to look at the engraving sample in daylight,” stripped out the cash and let the wallet fall on the sidewalk.  The mayor discovered the loss almost immediately.\n\n• Feeling guilty after Crusher Davis’s newspaper appeal, Sarah told the others what she had done and returned the money in a sealed envelope, signed by all four pupils, which she mailed to Inspector Samuels.  She then arranged to meet Crusher in the hope he could square things with the authorities.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJohnny Anderson – Present at all three scenes but a theft occurred only twice.  If Johnny were the thief, Charley Eastern’s cash would also be gone.  His boisterous argument in Home Depot was nothing more than genuine annoyance over the last electric sander.\n\nMorris Emerson – Likewise present all three times.  The non-theft at Safeway clears him.  His attempt to calm Johnny at Home Depot merely placed him well away from Sam Cartwright at the critical moment.\n\nTom Blankenship – Present all three times and seen leaving Safeway just ahead of Charley Eastern, but, again, no theft occurred there.  His arrival after parking the car at the jewelry store made him look suspicious, yet he had no practical chance to reach into the mayor’s inside right pocket while still in the doorway.\n\nOnly Sarah’s presence lines up exactly with the two real crimes, and only her absence coincides with the one non-crime.  Therefore Sarah Browne is the sole pickpocket; the others are guilt-free.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Sarah was at the movies when Charley Eastern’s wallet went missing. Thus, she could not be the pickpocket.\nMorris went over to calm the loud argument Johnny was having at the Home Depot, attracting attention to himself, which a thief would not have done. It also put him out of position to lift the wallet.\nJohnny was arguing at the Home Depot, removing himself from the spot where the theft of Sam Cartwright’s wallet occurred. Thus he could not have been the pickpocket.\nNot only is Tom Blankenship never exonerated, but he was the only one who could have taken Mayor Greenleaf’s wallet. He was outside the jewelry store, the only person in a position to steal Mayor Greenleaf’s wallet.\nIt took all of Crusher Davis’s persuasive abilities for Inspector Samuels to agree that no charges should be brought. Mayor Greenleaf, who was up for reelection, agreed, as did the other two victims. The fact that the confession was signed and mailed before the Ask Martha column even appeared showed contrition and was a strong point in the students’ favor.",

As you are doing now.” Sally the waitress sidled over, took his coffee order, brought a steaming mug, and left. “Is this a case for Crusher Davis or Ask Martha?” (In other words, do you want my help directly, or do I use my advice to the lovelorn column in the Chronicle to get clues?) “You decide, Crusher. It’s that rash of thefts we’ve been having recently. There seems to be a pattern developing. I think we are dealing with a pickpocket. Maybe some of your readers would have noticed something, if you could survey them carefully. Or perhaps, you could get some information that would help us solve the case. Frankly, something about it doesn’t make any sense to me.” I trusted his instinct. “So, if Martha finds out who did it, that may make it unofficial.” “That’s about it, yes.” “Tell me about any recent cases.” “Sure,” Inspector Samuels began. “On Tuesday afternoon, Sam Cartwright’s wallet was lifted when he went shopping at our Home Depot. The money was taken, but the credit cards were not touched. The wallet was found in the parking lot.” “Sounds like the thief, if there was one, could have made more money by using the credit cards.” “Sure, but this isn’t New York City. It’s Centerville, after all, and Sam is well known. At 6 foot 5, and 240 pounds, he is almost as big as you are, Crusher.” He added, “You know, the same thing happened to Charley Eastern at the Safeway last week. I hadn’t put it together. The difference was that he found his wallet on the floor near the checkout cashier and nothing had been taken from it. But you know how he is, almost uncoordinated. He can’t put on his trousers without knocking a lamp over! So I didn’t make anything of it.” “Funny. Any more cases?” “Yes, just now, Mayor Greenleaf had his wallet stolen. He was at The Elegant Jewelry Shop picking out a present for Mrs. Greenleaf for their anniversary. Same story. He checked his wallet, and it wasn’t there. It was found outside the store on the sidewalk, cash gone, everything else still in the wallet.” “How about suspects?” “That’s too strong a word. But four high school students were very close to where the incidents took place. They are Sarah Browne, Morris Emerson, Johnny Anderson and Tom Blankenship.” “You mean, Inspector, that each of the four was at each one of the three incidents?” “Yes. Well, not exactly. Sarah was at the movies when Charley Eastern was shopping at the Safeway. But Johnny Anderson and Morris Emerson were in the Safeway when it happened, and Charley says he saw Tom Blankenship leaving the Safeway exit door for the parking lot just before he left the store.” “What about the other two incidents, when money was actually taken?” “All four were together on a class project at The Elegant Jewelry Shop when Mayor Greenleaf was there. They were ordering an engraved pair of cuff links for Coach Johnson. He did have a great football season this year, after all - the best since you used to captain the team “So they were all together?” “Yes.” “Was the Mayor wearing a jacket?” “Yes. I know where you are going. The wallet, he said, was in the inside right pocket.” “Were the four inside the store when he arrived?” “Sarah, Morris and Johnny were already inside the jewelry store while Tom had been parking the car and followed the Mayor into the jewelry store.” “Who left the jewelry store first?” “Mayor Greenleaf did. That’s when he found his wallet on the sidewalk and called me.” “And the Sam Cartwright theft at Home Depot?” “He told me that he saw all four youngsters in the store when he was shopping.” “Does he remember where they were in the store?” “Yes. Johnny was having an argument a few aisles away with another customer, and they were pretty loud. It seems that there was only one electric sander left in stock and each wanted it. Morris went over when he heard the argument and tried to calm things down.” “What about Sarah and Tom?” “They were the next customers after Sam Cartwright at the checkout counter.” “Anything else?” “No. That’s it. And I am afraid it is pretty thin.” “You said it. I’ll ask a few questions and try to get some answers, without anybody’s reputation being damaged.” “Yes, Crusher, that’s the tough part. Many thanks.” He finished his coffee and left. My “Ask Martha” column in the Chronicle the next day asked for help from high school students in solving a baffling crime wave. Many students emailed me to help. That included Sarah Browne, so I called her on my cell phone, and we met after her classes. “I’m so glad you are looking into this,” she said. “We all read your Ask Martha column, and everyone remembers when you played football here. We trust you. And frankly, the whole thing has just gone too far.” “What? You mean these thefts?” “Yes. The four of us thought it would be fun, and none of the money was spent, of course.” She gave me an envelope containing the money from the wallets of Mayor Greenleaf and Sam Cartwright, carefully counted, with a paper signed by her and the other three students. “But I guess our little joke went too far. You see, we are all in drama class, and we are putting on ‘Oliver Twist’ at the high school next month. I play Nancy of course, Tom is the Artful Dodger, Morris is Fagin and Johnny is Oliver Twist. We had practiced the pickpocket scenes, and then someone had the idea, ‘Why not actually do it? It would make great publicity for our play, and we’ll give the money back on opening night!’” “When your column came out, we saw things had already gone too far. Nobody made the connection between the play and the thefts. Anyway, I must confess, I haven’t been sleeping very well since this all began! And so our signed ‘confession’ was mailed to Inspector Samuels yesterday, before your column appeared.” “Well, he hadn’t opened it when he talked with me. What did you confess?” “We explained what we had done, and that we had the money to be returned immediately.” “Fair enough. But something is missing. If all four of you took the wallets, there is no mystery. On the other hand, I think just one of your little group actually took the wallets, so the mystery then becomes - which one of the four of you was the pickpocket?” “That’s it exactly!” “I know who it was,” Crusher said. “And if you can get your three friends here quickly, I’ll ask Inspector Samuels to join us. Prepare for a lecture, but I’m hopeful that with Ask Martha on your side, he’ll let you off and persuade Sam Cartwright and Mayor Greenleaf not to press criminal charges. Who knows, maybe there will be a publicity angle for the play after all!” She breathed a sigh of relief and called her three friends. “From now on, we’ll leave crime and detection to you and the police force,” she said.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Johnny Anderson; (b) Morris Emerson; (c) Sarah Browne; (d) Tom Blankenship",
      "answer": "(d) Tom Blankenship",
      "outcome": "Sarah was at the movies when Charley Eastern’s wallet went missing. Thus, she could not be the pickpocket.\nMorris went over to calm the loud argument Johnny was having at the Home Depot, attracting attention to himself, which a thief would not have done. It also put him out of position to lift the wallet.\nJohnny was arguing at the Home Depot, removing himself from the spot where the theft of Sam Cartwright’s wallet occurred. Thus he could not have been the pickpocket.\nNot only is Tom Blankenship never exonerated, but he was the only one who could have taken Mayor Greenleaf’s wallet. He was outside the jewelry store, the only person in a position to steal Mayor Greenleaf’s wallet.\nIt took all of Crusher Davis’s persuasive abilities for Inspector Samuels to agree that no charges should be brought. Mayor Greenleaf, who was up for reelection, agreed, as did the other two victims. The fact that the confession was signed and mailed before the Ask Martha column even appeared showed contrition and was a strong point in the students’ favor."
