    "full_text": "The old graveyard out on the edge of town was a favorite meeting point for Tommy Allen and his friends. You may say that this was a strange place for young men to get together for a bit of fun and fellowship, but they shared a love of mystery and the macabre. Here, they could assume the mindset of their hero, Edgar Allan Poe, and swap ghost stories in the dark hours after sunset. The graveyard’s caretaker, old Farrell, allowed the young men to spend several evenings a year in the oldest part of the cemetery, far away from the newer portion and sporadic visitors. Tommy and his friends Stephen Cowan, Connor Hardison, Skylar Jordan and Anthony Beam had several causes for celebration on this first meeting night of the summer. Connor and Skylar were graduating from the city college, and they were acutely aware that 2009 marked the 200th birthday of their idol. They had wished to hold this meeting on January 19, Poe’s birthday, but winter nights were too bitter to meet in the graveyard and it had been an exceptionally cool and rainy spring. They had agreed to wait until school was out bringing drier, warmer weather before meeting for “Mr. Poe’s birthday party.” The young men brought snack suppers and blankets to sit on. Although the parties were usually over by midnight, occasionally they would doze off when the weather was nice and not leave the cemetery until the early hours of the morning. Once, a couple of years ago, they did not leave until almost 4:00 am. On that morning, even the brooding Stephen Cowan was affected by the darkness and sounds of the old cemetery. Darkness neared as the sun began to set. As the friends arrived at the meeting place, which was a huge oak tree in the far corner of the old cemetery, Tommy noticed that Stephen did not have a backpack or blanket. He had a small paper sack with a sandwich and drink, but that was all. Tommy began speaking when the last of the group arrived. He saw that everyone else had a backpack and either a blanket or jacket. Although the weather was warm, the temperature could cool quickly after sundown. He said, “Greetings to you, my friends and fellow Poe lovers. Tonight, we will eat cold sandwiches, consume warm soft drinks and tell stories. We also celebrate the 200th birthday of Mr. Poe, although we are a few months late.” After a few more words from Tommy concerning the life of Edgar Allan Poe, Connor opened the soft drinks and set the snack food out on a card table he had brought for the occasion, and then the friends “toasted” Poe with aluminum cans filled with soft drinks. No beer or liquor was allowed at these meetings, out of respect for Mr. Poe’s documented troubles with alcohol and to stay on good terms with old Farrell. Skylar uncomfortably noted that he was the only one not dressed in black in honor of Mr. Poe. He was dressed in a light pullover sport shirt and khaki shorts. After the snack supper, the boys traded stories. All were encouraged to author a new story for recitation at each meeting, but this was not mandatory. Tommy and Anthony did a couple of Poe readings, but Stephen, Connor and Skylar offered original tales. Skylar’s story about a haunted house with a 110-year-old occupant was particularly chilling. Around 10:30, the boys began to get drowsy. The weather was warm and the moonlight invited sleep. Soon, all were asleep. That is, except for one. When he was certain the others were comfortably asleep, the one who was still awake went into action. Quietly, he set up a miniature carved wooden tombstone dedicated to Edgar Allan Poe approximately 30 feet from the oak tree and placed a single shot of cognac and three stemmed roses in front of it. When his work was done, he quickly returned to his “spot” by the tree. Anthony awoke shortly after 11:00 pm (by his wristwatch) and briefly saw a dark dressed person fumbling with something a few yards from the tree. Although there was ample moonlight in the old cemetery, Anthony was groggy and quickly returned to sleep. Everyone slept soundly until almost 5:00 am. The sun rose early, and it was almost light when Tommy awoke. He felt slightly nauseated, like he always did when taking any kind of medicine. For this reason, it was rare for him to take any kind of medicine, let alone drugs or alcohol. His stomach simply would not tolerate them. Checking the time, he quickly woke everyone else up. He feared old Farrell would not be too happy with them spending the entire night. He wanted to clean the area and get out of there before he showed up. Farrell was known to arrive at the cemetery early. As the boys hurriedly cleaned up the area and prepared to leave, Stephen pointed to the miniature tombstone and said, “What is this?” The sun was now up as they walked the few feet over to it; they discovered a dummy tombstone with Edgar Allan Poe’s name on it, plus a small glass of cognac and three roses. All of the boys were well aware that these items were left at the real burial site of Mr. Poe by unknown persons on his birthday and had been every year since the 1940s. Tommy quickly sized up the situation. Grinning, he said to the others, “One of you has played a trick on us.” “How do we know it wasn’t you?” Anthony asked. “You don’t,” Tommy replied, “but I see we are going to have to figure this out. Farrell will be here soon.” Tommy found a small bottle of liquid doz-a-way by the picnic table. Doz-a-way was an over the counter sleeping medicine. The prankster had obviously added small amounts to each of the soft drink cans the night before. The dosages were obviously very mild and did not go into effect until after storytelling and relaxation. Anthony told the others of what he saw shortly after 11:00. Tommy told them of his slight nausea and his reluctance to take any kind of medicine. They swore on their friendship to the others that each was telling the truth. After few moments, Tommy broke an intense silence. He stated, “I believe I know who our Poe admirer is.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What had to be done?\n   – Spike the soft-drink cans with “Doz-a-way” so that everyone else would fall asleep early.  \n   – Remain awake one-and-a-half hours longer.  \n   – Set up a little wooden Poe gravestone, three roses and a shot of cognac about 30 ft from the oak tree.  \n   – Be back on the ground with the others before anyone stirred.\n\n2. What does that require?\n   a. A supply of the sleeping medicine and a moment beside the cans to pour it in.  \n   b. A way to avoid drinking the doctored soda (or an unusual tolerance).  \n   c. A place to carry the cognac, roses and miniature tombstone to the site, or to have hidden them there earlier.  \n   d. Clothing dark enough not to be recognised by the half-awake witness Anthony.\n\n3. Which facts in the story point to one person?\n   • Only one member, Stephen Cowan, arrived with no backpack or blanket—he clearly did not intend to bed down comfortably.  \n   • Stephen also carried his own small paper sack containing “a sandwich and drink.”  \n     – That separate drink means he could leave the spiked cans for the others while he himself stayed unaffected.  \n   • Connor handled the cans when he set them on the table, but he then drank from them; nobody says he had a private drink.  \n   • Anthony’s groggy glimpse showed “a dark-dressed person.”  Everybody but Skylar wore black; therefore Anthony did not see Skylar.  \n   • Skylar, the only one not in black, is effectively ruled out by that single observation.  \n   • Tommy’s well-known nausea toward medication makes him an unlikely self-drugger.  \n   • Stephen is the only one who simultaneously (i) had the means to stay awake, (ii) wore dark clothes, (iii) did not need a blanket, and (iv) possessed or could have cached the tribute items.\n\n4. Motive\n   The little ceremony exactly imitates the famous annual tribute at Poe’s real grave.  Among the five friends, the brooding, Poe-obsessed Stephen is the one most likely to want to stage an “authentic” birthday salute and to surprise the others with it.\n\n5. Tommy’s instant deduction\n   Tommy merely had to notice that (a) everyone drank the same cans except Stephen, and (b) Stephen alone had no bedding yet slept anyway; the rest follows at once.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTommy Allen, Stephen Cowan, Connor Hardison, Skylar Jordan, Anthony Beam\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nStephen Cowan\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring the afternoon Stephen Cowan secretly tucked a small carved wooden “Poe” head-stone into a clump of shrubs near the old oak tree.  He kept a miniature bottle of cognac, three fresh roses, and a bottle of the non-prescription sleep aid Doz-a-way in the paper lunch sack he planned to carry to the gathering.\n\nAt dusk the five friends met.  When Connor set the cans of soda on the folding table, Stephen, under the pretext of helping, dribbled a small dose of Doz-a-way into each can.  Stephen himself drank only the bottle of juice he had brought in his sack, so he would remain clear-headed.\n\nBy about 10:30 p.m. the medicated sodas made the others nod off.  Stephen, who had no blanket because he never meant to sleep, waited until the breathing around him was deep and regular.  Then he fetched the hidden wooden marker, planted it thirty feet away, poured a shot of cognac in a glass, laid three roses in front and slipped back under the oak tree.\n\nA few minutes later Anthony Beam stirred, drowsily caught sight of a dark-clad figure moving around, but sleep dragged him down again.\n\nHaving accomplished his private homage to Edgar Allan Poe—the roses, the cognac and the mock gravestone—Stephen finally dozed off himself, still sitting on the ground.\n\nNear dawn Tommy woke, felt the familiar queasiness that any medicine gives him, roused the others and discovered the tribute.  The empty Doz-a-way bottle beside the table told the story; the separate, still-capped drink bottle in Stephen’s sack and his lack of bed-gear identified the only person who could have carried out the trick.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nTommy Allen – His aversion to all medicines makes it irrational for him to drug himself.  He drank from the doctored cans and woke feeling sick.\n\nConnor Hardison – Although he handled the cans, he had no private drink; if he had added the drug he would have been the one least likely to stay awake, yet someone obviously remained conscious.\n\nSkylar Jordan – Anthony’s lone glimpse showed a dark-clothed figure, while Skylar wore a light shirt and khaki shorts.  Moreover, Skylar had no reason to violate the alcohol ban he himself supported.\n\nAnthony Beam – He was the only witness; at the critical time he was half-awake in his blanket and did nothing except fall back asleep.\n\nTherefore only Stephen Cowan had motive, means, opportunity and a workable method to stay awake long enough to stage the Poe-style tribute.  The mystery is solved.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

The moonlight was bright enough for him to have noticed that. Neither was it Anthony, for he swore to us that he saw our mystery man, but was not himself our Poe admirer.

The dosages were obviously very mild and did not go into effect until after storytelling and relaxation. Anthony told the others of what he saw shortly after 11:00. Tommy told them of his slight nausea and his reluctance to take any kind of medicine. They swore on their friendship to the others that each was telling the truth. After few moments, Tommy broke an intense silence. He stated, “I believe I know who our Poe admirer is.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Anthony; (b) Connor; (c) Skylar; (d) Stephen; (e) Tommy",
      "answer": "(b) Connor",
      "outcome": "“Keep talking,” Stephen replied.\nLooking at Stephen, Tommy said, “Well, Stephen, it wasn’t you. I noticed when we got here you had only a small bag with a sandwich and drink in it. The rest of us have backpacks where we could easily hide a small bottle of cognac and stemmed roses. I also notice that Skylar is the only one of us not wearing black in honor of Mr. Poe, and Anthony says that he saw a black dressed person at the small tombstone. The moonlight was bright enough for him to have noticed that. Neither was it Anthony, for he swore to us that he saw our mystery man, but was not himself our Poe admirer. I have sworn to you that it was not me and told you why: I cannot tolerate medicines of any kind and certainly would not have given myself sleeping meds if I did not need them.”\nConnor said to Tommy, “So that leaves me. What makes you think I set up the small memorial?”\nTommy grinned, “It’s really simple, Connor. You opened the cans of soft drinks before dinner last night. You were the only one to handle all of them.”\nConnor grinned, “Yes, ‘twas I! I wanted to treat our group to a mystery.”\nTommy answered, “That’s nice, Connor, but you are about to get us in trouble with Farrell. I see him coming this way now.”\n“Oh, we’re not in trouble with Farrell,” Connor said, flatly, “I told him what I wanted to do and he agreed. He even made the small tombstone for us. He likes to carve!”"
