    "full_text": "The old graveyard out on the edge of town was a favorite meeting point for Tommy Allen and his friends. You may say that this was a strange place for young men to get together for a bit of fun and fellowship, but they shared a love of mystery and the macabre. Here, they could assume the mindset of their hero, Edgar Allan Poe, and swap ghost stories in the dark hours after sunset. The graveyard’s caretaker, old Farrell, allowed the young men to spend several evenings a year in the oldest part of the cemetery, far away from the newer portion and sporadic visitors. Tommy and his friends Stephen Cowan, Connor Hardison, Skylar Jordan and Anthony Beam had several causes for celebration on this first meeting night of the summer. Connor and Skylar were graduating from the city college, and they were acutely aware that 2009 marked the 200th birthday of their idol. They had wished to hold this meeting on January 19, Poe’s birthday, but winter nights were too bitter to meet in the graveyard and it had been an exceptionally cool and rainy spring. They had agreed to wait until school was out bringing drier, warmer weather before meeting for “Mr. Poe’s birthday party.” The young men brought snack suppers and blankets to sit on. Although the parties were usually over by midnight, occasionally they would doze off when the weather was nice and not leave the cemetery until the early hours of the morning. Once, a couple of years ago, they did not leave until almost 4:00 am. On that morning, even the brooding Stephen Cowan was affected by the darkness and sounds of the old cemetery. Darkness neared as the sun began to set. As the friends arrived at the meeting place, which was a huge oak tree in the far corner of the old cemetery, Tommy noticed that Stephen did not have a backpack or blanket. He had a small paper sack with a sandwich and drink, but that was all. Tommy began speaking when the last of the group arrived. He saw that everyone else had a backpack and either a blanket or jacket. Although the weather was warm, the temperature could cool quickly after sundown. He said, “Greetings to you, my friends and fellow Poe lovers. Tonight, we will eat cold sandwiches, consume warm soft drinks and tell stories. We also celebrate the 200th birthday of Mr. Poe, although we are a few months late.” After a few more words from Tommy concerning the life of Edgar Allan Poe, Connor opened the soft drinks and set the snack food out on a card table he had brought for the occasion, and then the friends “toasted” Poe with aluminum cans filled with soft drinks. No beer or liquor was allowed at these meetings, out of respect for Mr. Poe’s documented troubles with alcohol and to stay on good terms with old Farrell. Skylar uncomfortably noted that he was the only one not dressed in black in honor of Mr. Poe. He was dressed in a light pullover sport shirt and khaki shorts. After the snack supper, the boys traded stories. All were encouraged to author a new story for recitation at each meeting, but this was not mandatory. Tommy and Anthony did a couple of Poe readings, but Stephen, Connor and Skylar offered original tales. Skylar’s story about a haunted house with a 110-year-old occupant was particularly chilling. Around 10:30, the boys began to get drowsy. The weather was warm and the moonlight invited sleep. Soon, all were asleep. That is, except for one. When he was certain the others were comfortably asleep, the one who was still awake went into action. Quietly, he set up a miniature carved wooden tombstone dedicated to Edgar Allan Poe approximately 30 feet from the oak tree and placed a single shot of cognac and three stemmed roses in front of it. When his work was done, he quickly returned to his “spot” by the tree. Anthony awoke shortly after 11:00 pm (by his wristwatch) and briefly saw a dark dressed person fumbling with something a few yards from the tree. Although there was ample moonlight in the old cemetery, Anthony was groggy and quickly returned to sleep. Everyone slept soundly until almost 5:00 am. The sun rose early, and it was almost light when Tommy awoke. He felt slightly nauseated, like he always did when taking any kind of medicine. For this reason, it was rare for him to take any kind of medicine, let alone drugs or alcohol. His stomach simply would not tolerate them. Checking the time, he quickly woke everyone else up. He feared old Farrell would not be too happy with them spending the entire night. He wanted to clean the area and get out of there before he showed up. Farrell was known to arrive at the cemetery early. As the boys hurriedly cleaned up the area and prepared to leave, Stephen pointed to the miniature tombstone and said, “What is this?” The sun was now up as they walked the few feet over to it; they discovered a dummy tombstone with Edgar Allan Poe’s name on it, plus a small glass of cognac and three roses. All of the boys were well aware that these items were left at the real burial site of Mr. Poe by unknown persons on his birthday and had been every year since the 1940s. Tommy quickly sized up the situation. Grinning, he said to the others, “One of you has played a trick on us.” “How do we know it wasn’t you?” Anthony asked. “You don’t,” Tommy replied, “but I see we are going to have to figure this out. Farrell will be here soon.” Tommy found a small bottle of liquid doz-a-way by the picnic table. Doz-a-way was an over the counter sleeping medicine. The prankster had obviously added small amounts to each of the soft drink cans the night before. The dosages were obviously very mild and did not go into effect until after storytelling and relaxation. Anthony told the others of what he saw shortly after 11:00. Tommy told them of his slight nausea and his reluctance to take any kind of medicine. They swore on their friendship to the others that each was telling the truth. After few moments, Tommy broke an intense silence. He stated, “I believe I know who our Poe admirer is.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe problem is to discover which of the five friends secretly duplicated the famous “Poe-toaster” ritual (mini-tombstone, three roses and a glass of cognac) and, to make sure no one interrupted him, drugged the others with the over–the-counter sleep­-aid Doz-a-way.  \nTo reach the answer we must look at motive, opportunity, physical evidence and simple logic.\n\n1.  MOTIVE  \n   • All five admire Poe, so every one of them could enjoy copying the ritual.  \n   • Nothing in the story singles out one of them as having a stronger emotional reason – so motive alone does not choose the culprit.\n\n2.  OPPORTUNITY / PRACTICALITIES  \n   a)  Getting the sleep-aid into the drinks or food  \n       – Only one person had real control of what he himself drank: Stephen.  \n       – Stephen brought his own small paper sack containing a sandwich and “a drink.”  \n         He did not have to touch the cans the others drank from and could therefore avoid the drug while the other four could not.  \n       – The remaining four all drank from the same supply of canned soft drinks that Connor set on the card table.  \n         Whoever drugged the others had to be able to stay awake himself; the simplest way is to avoid the medicine altogether.  \n         Stephen is the only one who obviously could do that.\n\n   b)  Remaining awake  \n       – Around 10:30 everyone became drowsy and nodded off.  \n       – Yet someone stayed awake, walked thirty feet, set out the tombstone, roses and cognac, and got back to his “spot.”  \n       – A person who had swallowed the same dose the rest of them had would almost certainly have fallen asleep too.  \n       – Again, Stephen is the only one who did not necessarily ingest the doctored drink.\n\n   c)  Transporting the ritual items  \n       – A small wooden tombstone, three roses and a miniature bottle or glass of cognac can easily be hidden earlier in the cemetery; they did not have to be carried in that night.  \n       – Stephen arrived with no backpack or blanket, which makes sense if he had already hidden everything he would need during the afternoon.  \n       – The other four all turned up with bulky packs or blankets that would have made stashing extra articles awkward.\n\n3.  PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND OBSERVATIONS  \n   • Anthony awoke “shortly after 11:00 p.m.” and saw “a dark-dressed person” near the tree.  \n     All of the friends except Skylar were dressed in black.  \n     Skylar, therefore, is eliminated – the person Anthony saw was wearing dark clothing.  \n   • Tommy’s stomach always reacts to medicine and he felt nauseated on waking – that fits a victim, not the poisoner.  \n   • Connor handled the cans, but he also drank from them and later slept soundly; in addition, someone saw a dark figure after 11 p.m. while Connor was asleep.  \n   • The small bottle of Doz-a-way is found on the ground.  A person with no pack or pocket left to put it in would be the likeliest to drop or forget it – Stephen again.  \n\n4.  LOGICAL DEDUCTION  \n   • To remain awake you must either (i) take a much smaller dose or (ii) not take the drug at all.  \n   • Only Stephen visibly insulated himself from the common drink source; therefore he alone could confidently avoid the drug.  \n   • The man Anthony glimpsed wears dark clothes; that keeps Skylar out and leaves Tommy, Connor, Anthony or Stephen.  \n   • Of those four, only Stephen had arranged matters so he would not be rendered unconscious.  \n   • Therefore Stephen Cowan is the only person who could have carried out every required action.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTommy Allen, Stephen Cowan, Connor Hardison, Skylar Jordan, Anthony Beam\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nStephen Cowan\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly in the afternoon Stephen Cowan slipped into the old part of the cemetery and hid a small wooden “Edgar Allan Poe” tombstone, three long-stemmed roses, a miniature glass and a small bottle of cognac behind a head-stone about thirty feet from the oak where the friends always met.  \nHe also brought a small bottle of liquid Doz-a-way.\n\nWhen night fell the five gathered.  Each of the four others drank the canned soft drinks Connor set out, but Stephen opened and drank from the bottle he had brought in his own paper sack, keeping himself free of the drug he had meanwhile squirted through the pop-tops of the other cans with a syringe (or had earlier added to the cans while they were still in the cooler).\n\nBy 10:30 the mild doses had made the others so drowsy that they dropped off to sleep on their blankets.  Stephen, wrapped only in his black clothes and therefore unencumbered by a blanket or pack, waited another quarter-hour to be sure they were fully under.  Then he retrieved his hidden items, set up the mock graveside tribute to Poe, poured a single shot of cognac, placed the three roses and hurried back to his place.  \n\nAnthony Beam stirred at 11:05 p.m. and, through half-shut eyes, saw a dark-clad figure (Stephen) “fumbling with something,” but fell back to sleep before identifying him.  \n\nJust before dawn the drug wore off.  Tommy woke at five, nauseated by the medication, and roused the others.  During the scramble to tidy the site Stephen “discovered” the display with the rest of them, feigning surprise.  He carelessly left the Doz-a-way bottle on the grass, assuming no one would connect it to him.\n\nTommy’s quick mind, however, noticed that only Stephen had brought no shared drink and therefore could be certain of staying awake, and that only Stephen’s lack of blanket and pack made sense if he never meant to sleep.  Tommy correctly identified him as the joker behind the Poe tribute.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nTommy Allen – He grew nauseated, the normal reaction his body has to medication; that shows he swallowed the sleep-aid like the other uninformed victims.  \nConnor Hardison – Although he handled the soft-drink cans, he too drank from them and slept soundly; Anthony’s glimpse of the prowler occurred while Connor was asleep.  \nSkylar Jordan – Anthony saw a “dark-dressed” person; Skylar alone wore light-colored clothes and therefore cannot be the man Anthony noticed.  \nAnthony Beam – He was roused by movement at 11 p.m., so he could not simultaneously be the person he saw.  He also exhibits the same drugged sleep as Tommy, Connor and Skylar.\n\nOnly Stephen Cowan avoided the drug, remained awake, and had both the means and the opportunity to stage the Poe-toaster prank.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

For this reason, it was rare for him to take any kind of medicine, let alone drugs or alcohol. His stomach simply would not tolerate them. Checking the time, he quickly woke everyone else up. He feared old Farrell would not be too happy with them spending the entire night. He wanted to clean the area and get out of there before he showed up. Farrell was known to arrive at the cemetery early. As the boys hurriedly cleaned up the area and prepared to leave, Stephen pointed to the miniature tombstone and said, “What is this?” The sun was now up as they walked the few feet over to it; they discovered a dummy tombstone with Edgar Allan Poe’s name on it, plus a small glass of cognac and three roses. All of the boys were well aware that these items were left at the real burial site of Mr. Poe by unknown persons on his birthday and had been every year since the 1940s. Tommy quickly sized up the situation. Grinning, he said to the others, “One of you has played a trick on us.” “How do we know it wasn’t you?” Anthony asked. “You don’t,” Tommy replied, “but I see we are going to have to figure this out. Farrell will be here soon.” Tommy found a small bottle of liquid doz-a-way by the picnic table. Doz-a-way was an over the counter sleeping medicine. The prankster had obviously added small amounts to each of the soft drink cans the night before. The dosages were obviously very mild and did not go into effect until after storytelling and relaxation. Anthony told the others of what he saw shortly after 11:00. Tommy told them of his slight nausea and his reluctance to take any kind of medicine. They swore on their friendship to the others that each was telling the truth. After few moments, Tommy broke an intense silence. He stated, “I believe I know who our Poe admirer is.”",

      "answer": "(b) Connor",
      "outcome": "“Keep talking,” Stephen replied.\nLooking at Stephen, Tommy said, “Well, Stephen, it wasn’t you. I noticed when we got here you had only a small bag with a sandwich and drink in it. The rest of us have backpacks where we could easily hide a small bottle of cognac and stemmed roses. I also notice that Skylar is the only one of us not wearing black in honor of Mr. Poe, and Anthony says that he saw a black dressed person at the small tombstone. The moonlight was bright enough for him to have noticed that. Neither was it Anthony, for he swore to us that he saw our mystery man, but was not himself our Poe admirer. I have sworn to you that it was not me and told you why: I cannot tolerate medicines of any kind and certainly would not have given myself sleeping meds if I did not need them.”\nConnor said to Tommy, “So that leaves me. What makes you think I set up the small memorial?”\nTommy grinned, “It’s really simple, Connor. You opened the cans of soft drinks before dinner last night. You were the only one to handle all of them.”\nConnor grinned, “Yes, ‘twas I! I wanted to treat our group to a mystery.”\nTommy answered, “That’s nice, Connor, but you are about to get us in trouble with Farrell. I see him coming this way now.”\n“Oh, we’re not in trouble with Farrell,” Connor said, flatly, “I told him what I wanted to do and he agreed. He even made the small tombstone for us. He likes to carve!”"
