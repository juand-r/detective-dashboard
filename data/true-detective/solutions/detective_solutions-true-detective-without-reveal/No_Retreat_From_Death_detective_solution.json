    "full_text": "It was only 1:00 p.m. on the first day of the company retreat in Hawaii, but already all the employees from Masterson Technologies had sunburns redder than the volcanic red Hawaiian sea salt they’d sprinkled on their feast at the luau the night before. Craig Willis’ face, however, turned an ashen grey when he saw the dead body in the small pool reserved for Masterson’s top five employees. Well, make that top four. Craig recognized the body as belonging to Trevor Jones, Masterson’s president. A firm believer in remaining physically fit at 50, Trevor’s leadership style reflected his fitness regimen -- no slacking off allowed, period. And since he often extended that to expecting those working under him to work through lunch and not take their rightful breaks, this retreat was the first time he’d ever socialized with his employees. At 32, Craig was a vice president of Masterson Technologies. He didn’t get that high up the corporate ladder that fast by shying away from difficult situations, but his first instinct here was to turn and walk away. A local police officer approached him, pushing all thoughts of running away out of his mind. “I’m Detective Kawika Akana. Are you Craig Willis?” he asked. “Yes.” “Good. That means we have all the suspects in one place. Come join your colleagues.” The detective indicated for Craig to go sit with his co-workers at a poolside table. “Are you just going to leave Trevor floating there?” Craig asked. “I’ve already determined that he was murdered,” the detective said. “The medical examiner will be here soon to confirm that he was forcibly drowned. In the meantime, I’m going to find out which of you killed Mr. Jones …” Craig didn’t know how to reply to that, so he sat down next to Niles Anderson, the company’s 45-year-old accountant. Stephanie Clark, the marketing VP sat on the other side of Niles, and next to her was the office manager, Amanda Kent. Both women were in their fifties, but they couldn’t be more different -- Stephanie an avid cyclist and Amanda an unrepentant couch potato. Detective Akana eyed the four Masterson employees thoughtfully. “So this is some sort of corporate retreat?” he asked. “Yes,” Amanda replied. “I suggested it. The employee morale level is really low. I figured those of us running the company had to improve our work situation first, then maybe our job satisfaction could trickle down through the ranks.” “Hah!” Niles said. “You’re talking like Trevor now.” To Amanda’s questioning look, he explained, “You said ‘trickle down through the ranks’ -- that’s Trevor’s army talk.” “Was Mr. Jones in the military?” Akana asked. “No,” Niles said, “but his father was. He acted like a drill sergeant more than a businessman. I blame the low morale on him. He never smiled, he never complimented anyone, and he discouraged employee fraternization.” “Truth is,” Amanda said, “the retreat was meant as an intervention. We were going to try to get him to relax and have fun, then confront him with our gripes.” “Yeah,” Stephanie said, “we hoped that outside the office he’d be more open to listening to us.” “But no such luck,” Craig said. “We arrived in time for a late dinner yesterday, but he got things off to an uncomfortable start with his sourpuss behavior. He refused to drink the free punch at the luau and rebuffed the pretty dancer who tried to get him on stage, and then this morning he said that he thought this retreat was a waste of time.” “And money,” Niles said. “He counted every penny so many times that he might as well have been doing my job.” “Meaning you’re the accountant?” Akana asked. “Yes, and I can assure you that the company will not suffer for this trip. In fact, we all could have brought our spouses without making a dent in the profit margins.” “Hmm,” Akana said. “If the company is doing that well, maybe Jones wasn’t such a bad leader.” “There’s more to life than money,” Craig said. “Mr. Jones no longer has a life,” Akana said. After a dead silence, the detective continued. “Okay, so none of you liked him and all of you were with him this morning, correct?” “Well, no,” Niles said, “I met up with everyone at the lunch buffet. I guess I ate some bad Poke last night, because I was up most of the night with stomach pains, then I slept in, and didn’t leave my room until I went to meet everyone for lunch.” “I’m not surprised,” Amanda said. “I feel sick just thinking about all the raw fish you ate.” “You are so old-fashioned,” Stephanie said to Amanda. “Everyone eats sushi nowadays. But maybe that explains it -- you’re afraid of fish!” It was obvious that Stephanie was just ribbing Amanda in a friendly manner, but the office manager seemed embarrassed in front of Akana. “Are we talking about why I won’t go swimming again … I nearly drowned as a little girl, so what – I’m terrified of water. But I don’t have a fish phobia. It’s not like I was attacked by a shark or anything. And in case you’ve forgotten, I told you just last night how much I enjoyed the Mahi Mahi.” Stephanie put up her hands in defeat. “Okay, okay, you win. I don’t think the detective wants to hear us two hens going at it, anyway.” Akana smiled. “However you normally behave around each other helps me paint a picture of the broader scenario in my mind,” he said. “So go on …” Amanda grinned. “Well, since she takes such good care of herself, I like to bug her about how great she looks for her age. But I think Stephanie must’ve just dyed the grey out of her hair yesterday because she took special care not to get it wet.” “Amanda!” Stephanie exclaimed. “But you’re right, I dyed it yesterday and I’m a little concerned about the chlorine because I heard it can turn blonde hair green. Now since you brought up my hair, should we talk about your latest diet …?” “Truce,” Amanda said. “It’s obvious there’s no love lost with Jones, the way you’re acting like everything’s normal,” Akana said. “Give them a break,” Niles said, “everybody mourns in their own way.” “I’m just trying not to think about the body,” Craig said, nonetheless glancing at it. “Do we have to sit here much longer?” “No,” Akana said, “I just want to clarify a couple more things. “Why didn’t Mr. Jones go with you to lunch?” “He’d decided to swim 100 laps and he intended to finish,” Craig said. “In fact, he chastised us for not joining him.” “Who was the last person at the pool with him?” “We all left for lunch together,” Craig said. “But then we all went to our rooms before meeting back up at the buffet. So I guess that means none of us have an alibi …” “True,” Akana said, “but only one of you is a murderer. And I know who.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • All four surviving executives had reasons to resent the tyrannical president, so motive alone doesn’t separate anyone.  \n\n2. Means / physical capacity  \n   • To “forcibly drown” a very fit, 50-year-old lap-swimmer, the killer almost certainly had to get into the water and be strong enough to hold him under.  \n     – Craig (32) and Niles (45) are males and probably strong enough.  \n     – Stephanie is an avid cyclist, but she had just dyed her blond hair the night before and was anxious about chlorine turning it green; she had been careful not to let her hair get wet that morning. Getting into the pool to struggle with Trevor would undo that effort.  \n     – Amanda is a self-described couch-potato who is terrified of water and hasn’t swum since almost drowning as a girl.  It is extremely unlikely she would jump in and wrestle a powerful swimmer.  \n\n3. Opportunity / alibis  \n   • Craig, Stephanie and Amanda admit being at poolside with Trevor during the morning. They left him still swimming his “100 laps,” went to their rooms, then met again at the buffet.  None of them has a solid alibi for the interval before 1 p.m.  \n   • Niles, however, claims he was never at the pool at all that morning.  He says he had stomach cramps from bad poke, slept late and came straight from his room to lunch.  \n\n4. The critical physical clue – sunburn  \n   • Narrator’s first sentence: “It was only 1:00 p.m. on the first day of the company retreat in Hawaii, but already all the employees … had sunburns redder than the volcanic red Hawaiian sea salt …”  \n   • They arrived “in time for a late dinner yesterday.”  A luau after sunset cannot produce a sunburn, so everyone’s redness must have been acquired THIS MORNING.  \n   • Therefore the only way to be sunburned is to have been outside in the Hawaiian sun this morning.  \n   • Niles insists he was indoors until lunch.  If that were true he would not be sunburned.  Yet the narrator states unambiguously that every employee is sunburned.  \n   • His story is a lie; he really was outside—and therefore could have been at the pool with Trevor.  \n\n5. Logic chain  \n   a) Niles lied about his whereabouts.  \n   b) That lie serves no purpose except to give himself an alibi.  \n   c) He is physically capable of holding Trevor under.  \n   d) No evidence indicates any accomplice or alternative method (poison, accident, mechanical device).  \n   ⇒ Niles Anderson is the only person whose words directly contradict the observable evidence, marking him as the killer Detective Akana identified.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCraig Willis, Niles Anderson, Stephanie Clark, Amanda Kent\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nNiles Anderson\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly this morning Trevor Jones went to the private pool to swim 100 laps.  Craig, Stephanie and Amanda were with him for a while, then left for their rooms in preparation for lunch.  \n\nNiles Anderson, contrary to his later claim of being sick in bed, had actually gone out earlier and joined the others poolside.  After they left he remained nearby, nursing his resentment of Trevor’s penny-pinching supervision.  When Trevor paused at the wall, winded from his workout, Niles slipped into the water, surprised him from behind and forced him under.  Trevor, exhausted from the long swim and caught off-guard, couldn’t break free before drowning.  \n\nNiles then climbed out, toweled off, stayed in the sun long enough to dry (and, inadvertently, to redden), returned to his room, and concocted the “bad poke” story to explain his absence from the morning activities.  He joined the others at the buffet, assuming the body would not be discovered until later.  Unfortunately for him, Detective Akana immediately noticed that “sick-in-bed” Niles was just as sunburned as everyone who had obviously spent the morning outdoors—exposing Niles’s lie and pointing straight to him as the murderer.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nCraig Willis: Found the body, cooperated, and never contradicted himself.  Nothing shows he lied about his whereabouts.  \n\nStephanie Clark: Had deliberately kept her freshly-dyed hair dry all morning; jumping into the chlorinated pool to fight with Trevor would have ruined her hair and exposed the dye, which the others would have noticed immediately.  No sign of wet or discolored hair was mentioned.  \n\nAmanda Kent: Terrified of water and openly admits she will not swim.  Forcing a fit swimmer under water would require entering the pool—something she is psychologically and physically unlikely to do.  No evidence contradicts her statements.  \n\nThus Niles Anderson is the sole person whose statements clash with the physical evidence, making him—and only him—the killer.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

    "reveal_text": "“How do you know?” Craig asked. “I didn’t hear anyone say anything incriminating.”\n“It’s not always what people say that gives them away,” Akana replied. “For instance, you should’ve seen your face when I first met you. Seeing that body made you turn pale -- you can’t fake that kind of reaction. It’s obvious you’ve never seen a dead body in person before, much less killed someone.\n“And the women absolved each other,” Akana said. “Stephanie revealed that Amanda’s afraid of swimming and Amanda revealed that Stephanie didn’t want to get her hair wet. Well, there’s no way either of them could’ve overpowered Mr. Jones long enough to drown him, not with Amanda lacking confidence in the water and Stephanie’s hair remaining dry.”\nNiles brayed out a laugh. “So, what? Process of elimination says it’s me? You’ve got the wrong man,” he said.\n“Process of elimination usually tells me what I need to know,” the detective said. “But the most common thing is for the guilty party to give themselves away. Like for instance, you lied to me.”\nThe others turned and stared at Niles. He scratched at his sunburn nervously. “I did no such thing.”\n“You said you didn’t leave your room until you went to lunch …”\n“Yeah, that’s right.”\n“You may not have been at this pool this morning, but you weren’t in your room, either.” Akana pointed at where Niles’ was scratching. “You just arrived yesterday evening, yet you’re sunburned, so you must’ve been in the sun today. So I know you did it, I just don’t know why.”\nNiles looked around, as if calculating his chance for escape, but what was he going to do -- swim home from Hawaii? He sighed, defeated. “It’s a big resort,” he said. “I went to the wrong pool this morning and by the time I’d figured it out, I was already settled in on a lounge chair with a good book, so I didn’t feel like moving. I swung by here on my way to lunch and found Trevor swimming alone. He said we were all supposed to stick together on the retreat and accused me of ‘slacking off’ this morning. It was just such a ridiculous a thing for him to get on my case about -- yet so typical of how he treats us -- that I got this uncontrollable urge to make him shut up … for good.”\nAkana shook his head in dismay. “And now I have an uncontrollable urge to read you your rights.”",

Stephanie Clark, the marketing VP sat on the other side of Niles, and next to her was the office manager, Amanda Kent. Both women were in their fifties, but they couldn’t be more different -- Stephanie an avid cyclist and Amanda an unrepentant couch potato. Detective Akana eyed the four Masterson employees thoughtfully. “So this is some sort of corporate retreat?” he asked. “Yes,” Amanda replied. “I suggested it. The employee morale level is really low. I figured those of us running the company had to improve our work situation first, then maybe our job satisfaction could trickle down through the ranks.” “Hah!” Niles said. “You’re talking like Trevor now.” To Amanda’s questioning look, he explained, “You said ‘trickle down through the ranks’ -- that’s Trevor’s army talk.” “Was Mr. Jones in the military?” Akana asked. “No,” Niles said, “but his father was. He acted like a drill sergeant more than a businessman. I blame the low morale on him. He never smiled, he never complimented anyone, and he discouraged employee fraternization.” “Truth is,” Amanda said, “the retreat was meant as an intervention. We were going to try to get him to relax and have fun, then confront him with our gripes.” “Yeah,” Stephanie said, “we hoped that outside the office he’d be more open to listening to us.” “But no such luck,” Craig said. “We arrived in time for a late dinner yesterday, but he got things off to an uncomfortable start with his sourpuss behavior. He refused to drink the free punch at the luau and rebuffed the pretty dancer who tried to get him on stage, and then this morning he said that he thought this retreat was a waste of time.” “And money,” Niles said. “He counted every penny so many times that he might as well have been doing my job.” “Meaning you’re the accountant?” Akana asked. “Yes, and I can assure you that the company will not suffer for this trip. In fact, we all could have brought our spouses without making a dent in the profit margins.” “Hmm,” Akana said. “If the company is doing that well, maybe Jones wasn’t such a bad leader.” “There’s more to life than money,” Craig said. “Mr. Jones no longer has a life,” Akana said. After a dead silence, the detective continued. “Okay, so none of you liked him and all of you were with him this morning, correct?” “Well, no,” Niles said, “I met up with everyone at the lunch buffet. I guess I ate some bad Poke last night, because I was up most of the night with stomach pains, then I slept in, and didn’t leave my room until I went to meet everyone for lunch.” “I’m not surprised,” Amanda said. “I feel sick just thinking about all the raw fish you ate.” “You are so old-fashioned,” Stephanie said to Amanda. “Everyone eats sushi nowadays. But maybe that explains it -- you’re afraid of fish!” It was obvious that Stephanie was just ribbing Amanda in a friendly manner, but the office manager seemed embarrassed in front of Akana. “Are we talking about why I won’t go swimming again … I nearly drowned as a little girl, so what – I’m terrified of water. But I don’t have a fish phobia. It’s not like I was attacked by a shark or anything. And in case you’ve forgotten, I told you just last night how much I enjoyed the Mahi Mahi.” Stephanie put up her hands in defeat. “Okay, okay, you win. I don’t think the detective wants to hear us two hens going at it, anyway.” Akana smiled. “However you normally behave around each other helps me paint a picture of the broader scenario in my mind,” he said. “So go on …” Amanda grinned. “Well, since she takes such good care of herself, I like to bug her about how great she looks for her age. But I think Stephanie must’ve just dyed the grey out of her hair yesterday because she took special care not to get it wet.” “Amanda!” Stephanie exclaimed. “But you’re right, I dyed it yesterday and I’m a little concerned about the chlorine because I heard it can turn blonde hair green. Now since you brought up my hair, should we talk about your latest diet …?” “Truce,” Amanda said. “It’s obvious there’s no love lost with Jones, the way you’re acting like everything’s normal,” Akana said. “Give them a break,” Niles said, “everybody mourns in their own way.” “I’m just trying not to think about the body,” Craig said, nonetheless glancing at it. “Do we have to sit here much longer?” “No,” Akana said, “I just want to clarify a couple more things. “Why didn’t Mr. Jones go with you to lunch?” “He’d decided to swim 100 laps and he intended to finish,” Craig said. “In fact, he chastised us for not joining him.” “Who was the last person at the pool with him?” “We all left for lunch together,” Craig said. “But then we all went to our rooms before meeting back up at the buffet. So I guess that means none of us have an alibi …” “True,” Akana said, “but only one of you is a murderer. And I know who.”",

      "answer": "(c) Niles Anderson",
      "outcome": "“How do you know?” Craig asked. “I didn’t hear anyone say anything incriminating.”\n“It’s not always what people say that gives them away,” Akana replied. “For instance, you should’ve seen your face when I first met you. Seeing that body made you turn pale -- you can’t fake that kind of reaction. It’s obvious you’ve never seen a dead body in person before, much less killed someone.\n“And the women absolved each other,” Akana said. “Stephanie revealed that Amanda’s afraid of swimming and Amanda revealed that Stephanie didn’t want to get her hair wet. Well, there’s no way either of them could’ve overpowered Mr. Jones long enough to drown him, not with Amanda lacking confidence in the water and Stephanie’s hair remaining dry.”\nNiles brayed out a laugh. “So, what? Process of elimination says it’s me? You’ve got the wrong man,” he said.\n“Process of elimination usually tells me what I need to know,” the detective said. “But the most common thing is for the guilty party to give themselves away. Like for instance, you lied to me.”\nThe others turned and stared at Niles. He scratched at his sunburn nervously. “I did no such thing.”\n“You said you didn’t leave your room until you went to lunch …”\n“Yeah, that’s right.”\n“You may not have been at this pool this morning, but you weren’t in your room, either.” Akana pointed at where Niles’ was scratching. “You just arrived yesterday evening, yet you’re sunburned, so you must’ve been in the sun today. So I know you did it, I just don’t know why.”\nNiles looked around, as if calculating his chance for escape, but what was he going to do -- swim home from Hawaii? He sighed, defeated. “It’s a big resort,” he said. “I went to the wrong pool this morning and by the time I’d figured it out, I was already settled in on a lounge chair with a good book, so I didn’t feel like moving. I swung by here on my way to lunch and found Trevor swimming alone. He said we were all supposed to stick together on the retreat and accused me of ‘slacking off’ this morning. It was just such a ridiculous a thing for him to get on my case about -- yet so typical of how he treats us -- that I got this uncontrollable urge to make him shut up … for good.”\nAkana shook his head in dismay. “And now I have an uncontrollable urge to read you your rights.”"
