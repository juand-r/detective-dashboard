    "full_text": "The letter was so heartfelt that it was almost soggy. Crusher Davis read it for the third time as he sipped his Latte Gigantico (they were out of large size cups), burning his tongue. He almost dropped the coffee. Then he read the letter again, squirming in his seat at the Lonesome Polecat Café, Centerville’s western themed coffee house. The owner hoped that the new decorations and sagebrush themed posters would attract more customers than the few that had been regulars at Joe’s Coffee Shop. Crusher sometimes wondered why he had accepted the task of writing the personal advice column for the Chronicle, as Ask Martha. Then he remembered - the rent had to be paid, and besides, he rather enjoyed it. Nobody except Inspector Samuels of the Centerville Police Force had guessed his identity, and he wouldn’t spread the word - not if he wanted Crusher’s help solving cases. And so he bent his 6 foot 6, 265 pound frame over the table and stared once again at the letter he was holding. “Usually, I’d send an email,” the letter began, “but now I’m just too upset, and anyway, I don’t trust the security anymore,” said the writer, Joan Colthrop. She was so upset that she had used her own name, which was unusual in messages to Ask Martha. Usually false names were used, which gave sly clues to the content of the message, like Tired of Waiting or Too Good for Him. The letter went on, “I have NOBODY to turn to, since one of my very best friends is a thief. The BETRAYAL! I don’t even know which one it was.” Her letter, addressed simply to Ask Martha, The Chronicle, Main Street, Centerville, said that she and three friends had met for luncheon. Then, some of them had gone shopping. By prearrangement, Joan had split the check with Grace Means, “daughter of Samuel Means, who owns half the town,” in order to spare embarrassment to the other two young women, Laura Parsons and Maybelle Johnson, neither of whom had much spending money. Joan explained rather unnecessarily that when it was their turn to treat, they cooked a picnic luncheon, splitting the costs. “Or rather, Laura does most of the cooking. She’s really good at it. Nose to the grindstone type, and she’ll turn out just fine. She studies part time at the Culinary Institute, you know. We think of her as our Julia Childs - which of course, since she is only 5 foot 1, she is NOT!” Her letter went on, “By contrast, Grace and Maybelle are tall, like me. Maybelle is rather pretty, for those who like the type. She is always ogling things that she wishes she could afford to buy, whereas Laura would make plans to make enough money to buy anything she wanted. Maybelle just seems to like what is on the other side of the fence. Why, she has even been making passes at my boyfriend, Steve Cartwright, who has never said he even noticed.” Her letter went on to explain that the four friends, after luncheon, split up. She had gone shopping with Laura, who only went window-shopping, and then Joan had gone to the matinee at the Bijou Theater. Grace and Maybelle had gone out together, for they enjoyed shopping together, trying on clothes, and then they had walked home together. At the end of the afternoon, disappointed by the movie, Joan had gone home, kicked off her shoes and absentmindedly looked in her purse for some Kleenex. Drat! She had forgotten to buy a pack. “Then,” she wrote, “I remembered to check my wallet and took it out of my purse. It was fine - but my Master Card was MISSING! I emptied my purse carefully, looked through everything more than once, but it just wasn’t there!” “Then,” she went on, “I thought to check my Master Card account on line. That is when I really got upset!” She always made it a point to pay her monthly charges in full, so that no finance charges were ever due. She had found that there were authorized charges for $550. “In something of a panic, I called their customer service and reached an actual person, for a change,” she wrote. “The charges were made that very afternoon, for a cashmere robe, size Large (Tall) and a pair of elegant shoes, size 9 ½. “I cancelled the credit card, and they told me that I would be issued a new one after their investigation. I was going to call the two stores where the thefts took place, Keith’s Shoes and the Maple Street Fashion Shop, but that’s when I remembered that you, Ask Martha, get into crime solving sometimes. It would be a great help if you could sort out this mystery and let me know the results. Then I can confront the thief in a quiet way, without publicity. It will be better all around.” “I know I’ll lose a friend, but she is gone anyway. Handling this quietly is far better than her being charged with theft. I’m so grateful for your help and hope you will use my letter to catch the thief.” The letter ended, “Your faithful reader, Joan Colthrop.” Crusher folded the letter and put it in his pocket. He ambled down the street to Keith’s Shoes and talked with the only salesgirl. The recession may be hurting business, but it made it easier to find salespeople, who were fewer than in better economic times. The salesgirl was new in town, but remembered a tall young woman, who had bought the shoes. “It was after my coffee break, so that must have been just before we closed.” After some prodding the salesgirl went to the office and, with the help of the manager, found the store’s credit card receipt. The signature didn’t look like the one in the letter from Joan Colthrop. The story was similar at the Maple Street Fashion Shop, where a salesman remembered that a tall girl had come in alone towards the end of the afternoon. He supposed he would recognize her again, but then the sales manager intervened and said he hoped that this could be handled quietly. He didn’t want to deter other customers from coming - business was bad enough as it was! The signature on the credit card purchase matched the one at Keith’s Shoes. Crusher Davis smiled, and went back to his office at the Chronicle. He thought about calling Inspector Samuels, but then remembered that Sherlock Holmes didn’t always turn criminals over to the police. It was time to give one young lady the scare of her life, well worth it if she never again tried the sad game of identity theft!",

List them here:\n\n<SUSPECTS>\n<names(s) for all suspects here, comma separated>\n</SUSPECTS>\n\nWho is the culprit?  There is only one. If possible, include first and last names, as well as any aliases. Answer in the form:\n\n<CULPRIT>\n<name here>\n</CULPRIT>\n\nNow write down your reconstruction of the events of what actually happened.\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n<event reconstruction here>\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\nFinally, explain why the other suspects are innocent.\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n<explanation here>\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who had a REASON to steal?  \n   • Laura Parsons – hardworking, thrifty, already saving for culinary school; no sign she covets expensive clothes.  \n   • Grace Means – extremely well-off (her father “owns half the town”), so she does not need someone else’s money, but she may wish to buy things without her father noticing the charges that appear on the monthly statement he undoubtedly pays.  \n   • Maybelle Johnson – admittedly short of cash and forever “ogling things she wishes she could afford.” A strong financial motive.\n\n2. Who could WEAR what was bought?  \n   The purchases were a cashmere robe marked “Large (Tall)” and shoes size 9 ½.  \n   • Laura – only 5′ 1″; a Large-Tall robe and 9 ½ shoes would drown her.  \n   • Grace – described simply as “tall, like me” (Joan is tall); a Large-Tall robe and size-9 ½ shoes are perfectly believable.  \n   • Maybelle – also tall, but repeatedly called “rather pretty,” i.e. probably slim. A Large robe is less likely, though possible. Shoe size 9 ½ is on the big side for a fashion-minded beauty who tries on clothes constantly.\n\n3. Who had the best CHANCE to lift the card?  \n   Joan’s card had to disappear BEFORE Joan left Laura and went to the cinema, because the fraudulent purchases were made later in the afternoon.  \n   a)  During lunch, only Joan and Grace handled money: they “split the check by pre-arrangement.” Grace therefore had Joan’s open wallet directly in front of her, and could palm the card while ostensibly helping to total the bill.  \n   b)  Laura never saw the wallet at lunch.  \n   c)  Maybelle was sitting at the table but was not dealing with the check; she would have had to pickpocket the card in full view or wait for a moment when Joan left the table—harder and far riskier than Grace’s opportunity.\n\n4. Who actually ENTERED the two shops?  \n   Staff in both stores remember only one tall girl, shopping alone, shortly before closing time.  Grace and Maybelle had been shopping together all afternoon, yet now only one of them is seen.  If Grace had temporarily slipped away from Maybelle to make two quick purchases, that fits both sightings and leaves her free to rendezvous with Maybelle again for the “walk home together” Joan later heard about.\n\n5. Why did Crusher keep the police out of it?  \n   Joan’s letter begged for “a quiet way” to avoid publicity.  Maybelle, who has no influential relatives, could easily have been turned over to the police.  But exposing Samuel Means’s daughter would embroil half the merchants in town in scandal.  Letting Grace’s father handle it privately is both quiet and effective—precisely why Crusher copies Sherlock Holmes and merely “gives one young lady the scare of her life.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGrace Means, Laura Parsons, Maybelle Johnson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nGrace Means\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Before the four friends met for lunch Grace had decided she wanted an expensive cashmere robe and matching shoes but did not want the charges appearing on her own account where her father would see them.  \n• Knowing the bill-splitting arrangement, she suggested the restaurant that day and sat beside Joan.  \n• While the two of them were figuring out their halves of the check, Grace quietly slid Joan’s MasterCard out of the wallet and pocketed it.  Nobody noticed; Maybelle and Laura were chatting.  \n• Grace spent the afternoon window-shopping with Maybelle.  Near closing time she excused herself—“I just want to look at one more thing”—and hurried into Maple Street Fashion Shop, bought the Large-Tall robe, forged Joan’s name, then crossed the street to Keith’s Shoes and purchased the 9 ½ pumps.  \n• She rejoined Maybelle a few minutes later and the two girls strolled home.  The card went into a bureau drawer; Grace intended to cut it up after the bill arrived.  \n• That evening Joan discovered the loss, wrote to “Ask Martha,” and Crusher Davis traced the forged slips, found the size information, and deduced that the only tall girl who both needed a Large-Tall size and had easy access to Joan’s wallet was Grace Means.  Rather than involve the police, he informed Grace—and her powerful father—giving her “the scare of her life” and ensuring she never tries identity theft again.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nLaura Parsons: Far too short for Tall-size clothing or 9 ½ shoes, had no direct access to Joan’s wallet, and was in Joan’s company (window-shopping) while the card first disappeared.\n\nMaybelle Johnson: Although she wanted nice things, she never handled the money at lunch and would have had to steal the card by pickpocketing.  The clothing bought (Large-Tall, size-9 ½ shoes) is an unlikely fit for a fashion-conscious “pretty” girl.  Moreover, store staff saw only one tall customer; Maybelle was still with Grace at that hour and so was not shopping alone.\n\nTherefore, only Grace Means had the motive (hide purchases from her father), the easy opportunity (handling the check), the physical match to the merchandise, and the solitary presence in both shops.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Ask Martha realized that it was the letter writer herself, Joan Colthrop, who staged the phony theft of her own credit card! Grace Means was wealthy and had no reason to steal her friend’s credit card. Laura Parsons was simply too short for the purchases of size 9 ½ shoes and a Large (Tall) cashmere robe. It would have been totally out of character for her to do so. She was said to be a hard worker, who earned her own way.\nThat leaves Maybelle Johnson and the letter writer herself, Joan Colthrop. Joan is bitter about Maybelle’s attempt to steal her boyfriend. Like Joan herself, Maybelle is tall. However, she went shopping with Grace, and they walked home together. The salesperson at the Maple Street Fashion Shop was sure that the young woman who bought the cashmere robe was alone.\nThe two charged purchases were made by a single person at the end of the afternoon, surely after the matinee at the Bijou Theater, which Joan Colthrop had attended, was over. Joan had thought, by involving Ask Martha, to avoid going back to either store, where she might be recognized. Instead, she left too many clues - and to spite her friend, was the thief of her own identity!",

The salesgirl was new in town, but remembered a tall young woman, who had bought the shoes. “It was after my coffee break, so that must have been just before we closed.” After some prodding the salesgirl went to the office and, with the help of the manager, found the store’s credit card receipt. The signature didn’t look like the one in the letter from Joan Colthrop. The story was similar at the Maple Street Fashion Shop, where a salesman remembered that a tall girl had come in alone towards the end of the afternoon. He supposed he would recognize her again, but then the sales manager intervened and said he hoped that this could be handled quietly. He didn’t want to deter other customers from coming - business was bad enough as it was! The signature on the credit card purchase matched the one at Keith’s Shoes. Crusher Davis smiled, and went back to his office at the Chronicle. He thought about calling Inspector Samuels, but then remembered that Sherlock Holmes didn’t always turn criminals over to the police. It was time to give one young lady the scare of her life, well worth it if she never again tried the sad game of identity theft!",
      "answer_options": "(a) Grace Means; (b) Joan Colthrop; (c) Laura Parsons; (d) Maybelle Johnson",
      "answer": "(b) Joan Colthrop",
      "outcome": "Ask Martha realized that it was the letter writer herself, Joan Colthrop, who staged the phony theft of her own credit card! Grace Means was wealthy and had no reason to steal her friend’s credit card. Laura Parsons was simply too short for the purchases of size 9 ½ shoes and a Large (Tall) cashmere robe. It would have been totally out of character for her to do so. She was said to be a hard worker, who earned her own way.\nThat leaves Maybelle Johnson and the letter writer herself, Joan Colthrop. Joan is bitter about Maybelle’s attempt to steal her boyfriend. Like Joan herself, Maybelle is tall. However, she went shopping with Grace, and they walked home together. The salesperson at the Maple Street Fashion Shop was sure that the young woman who bought the cashmere robe was alone.\nThe two charged purchases were made by a single person at the end of the afternoon, surely after the matinee at the Bijou Theater, which Joan Colthrop had attended, was over. Joan had thought, by involving Ask Martha, to avoid going back to either store, where she might be recognized. Instead, she left too many clues - and to spite her friend, was the thief of her own identity!"
