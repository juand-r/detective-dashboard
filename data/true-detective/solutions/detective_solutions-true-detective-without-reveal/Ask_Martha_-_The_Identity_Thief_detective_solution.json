    "full_text": "The letter was so heartfelt that it was almost soggy. Crusher Davis read it for the third time as he sipped his Latte Gigantico (they were out of large size cups), burning his tongue. He almost dropped the coffee. Then he read the letter again, squirming in his seat at the Lonesome Polecat Café, Centerville’s western themed coffee house. The owner hoped that the new decorations and sagebrush themed posters would attract more customers than the few that had been regulars at Joe’s Coffee Shop. Crusher sometimes wondered why he had accepted the task of writing the personal advice column for the Chronicle, as Ask Martha. Then he remembered - the rent had to be paid, and besides, he rather enjoyed it. Nobody except Inspector Samuels of the Centerville Police Force had guessed his identity, and he wouldn’t spread the word - not if he wanted Crusher’s help solving cases. And so he bent his 6 foot 6, 265 pound frame over the table and stared once again at the letter he was holding. “Usually, I’d send an email,” the letter began, “but now I’m just too upset, and anyway, I don’t trust the security anymore,” said the writer, Joan Colthrop. She was so upset that she had used her own name, which was unusual in messages to Ask Martha. Usually false names were used, which gave sly clues to the content of the message, like Tired of Waiting or Too Good for Him. The letter went on, “I have NOBODY to turn to, since one of my very best friends is a thief. The BETRAYAL! I don’t even know which one it was.” Her letter, addressed simply to Ask Martha, The Chronicle, Main Street, Centerville, said that she and three friends had met for luncheon. Then, some of them had gone shopping. By prearrangement, Joan had split the check with Grace Means, “daughter of Samuel Means, who owns half the town,” in order to spare embarrassment to the other two young women, Laura Parsons and Maybelle Johnson, neither of whom had much spending money. Joan explained rather unnecessarily that when it was their turn to treat, they cooked a picnic luncheon, splitting the costs. “Or rather, Laura does most of the cooking. She’s really good at it. Nose to the grindstone type, and she’ll turn out just fine. She studies part time at the Culinary Institute, you know. We think of her as our Julia Childs - which of course, since she is only 5 foot 1, she is NOT!” Her letter went on, “By contrast, Grace and Maybelle are tall, like me. Maybelle is rather pretty, for those who like the type. She is always ogling things that she wishes she could afford to buy, whereas Laura would make plans to make enough money to buy anything she wanted. Maybelle just seems to like what is on the other side of the fence. Why, she has even been making passes at my boyfriend, Steve Cartwright, who has never said he even noticed.” Her letter went on to explain that the four friends, after luncheon, split up. She had gone shopping with Laura, who only went window-shopping, and then Joan had gone to the matinee at the Bijou Theater. Grace and Maybelle had gone out together, for they enjoyed shopping together, trying on clothes, and then they had walked home together. At the end of the afternoon, disappointed by the movie, Joan had gone home, kicked off her shoes and absentmindedly looked in her purse for some Kleenex. Drat! She had forgotten to buy a pack. “Then,” she wrote, “I remembered to check my wallet and took it out of my purse. It was fine - but my Master Card was MISSING! I emptied my purse carefully, looked through everything more than once, but it just wasn’t there!” “Then,” she went on, “I thought to check my Master Card account on line. That is when I really got upset!” She always made it a point to pay her monthly charges in full, so that no finance charges were ever due. She had found that there were authorized charges for $550. “In something of a panic, I called their customer service and reached an actual person, for a change,” she wrote. “The charges were made that very afternoon, for a cashmere robe, size Large (Tall) and a pair of elegant shoes, size 9 ½. “I cancelled the credit card, and they told me that I would be issued a new one after their investigation. I was going to call the two stores where the thefts took place, Keith’s Shoes and the Maple Street Fashion Shop, but that’s when I remembered that you, Ask Martha, get into crime solving sometimes. It would be a great help if you could sort out this mystery and let me know the results. Then I can confront the thief in a quiet way, without publicity. It will be better all around.” “I know I’ll lose a friend, but she is gone anyway. Handling this quietly is far better than her being charged with theft. I’m so grateful for your help and hope you will use my letter to catch the thief.” The letter ended, “Your faithful reader, Joan Colthrop.” Crusher folded the letter and put it in his pocket. He ambled down the street to Keith’s Shoes and talked with the only salesgirl. The recession may be hurting business, but it made it easier to find salespeople, who were fewer than in better economic times. The salesgirl was new in town, but remembered a tall young woman, who had bought the shoes. “It was after my coffee break, so that must have been just before we closed.” After some prodding the salesgirl went to the office and, with the help of the manager, found the store’s credit card receipt. The signature didn’t look like the one in the letter from Joan Colthrop. The story was similar at the Maple Street Fashion Shop, where a salesman remembered that a tall girl had come in alone towards the end of the afternoon. He supposed he would recognize her again, but then the sales manager intervened and said he hoped that this could be handled quietly. He didn’t want to deter other customers from coming - business was bad enough as it was! The signature on the credit card purchase matched the one at Keith’s Shoes. Crusher Davis smiled, and went back to his office at the Chronicle. He thought about calling Inspector Samuels, but then remembered that Sherlock Holmes didn’t always turn criminals over to the police. It was time to give one young lady the scare of her life, well worth it if she never again tried the sad game of identity theft!",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could USE the things that were bought?  \n   – Cashmere robe size “Large-TALL” and shoes size 9½ will only fit a tall woman with large feet.  \n   – Joan says three of the four girls are tall (herself, Grace, Maybelle).  \n   – Laura, at 5´1˝, is ruled out by the sizes.\n\n2. Who had a CHANCE to get the card?  \n   A.  After lunch Joan and Grace handled their wallets while they “split the check”.  \n       Grace had Joan’s card in her hand for a moment (the waiter brings both cards back, they lie on the table, Grace gathers them up).  \n   B.  From that moment on Joan’s purse was closed.  The only person who was with her later was Laura – but Laura never had any occasion to rummage in Joan’s handbag while they were walking and window-shopping.  \n   C.  Maybelle was never near Joan after lunch.\n\n     The only realistic opportunity is the moment the bill was paid, and the only person (apart from Joan herself) who touched the card then was Grace.\n\n3. Who MATCHES the shop witnesses?  \n   – Both shop employees spoke of “a tall girl who came in ALONE near closing time”.  \n   – After lunch Grace and Maybelle went out together, but Joan’s information is second-hand.  Grace could easily have slipped away for half an hour; afterwards she and Maybelle “walked home together”, exactly as Joan later heard.  \n   – Laura is not tall; Maybelle is tall but would have been with Grace at that moment if Grace had not separated from her.  The witnesses saw only one girl, so the one who temporarily went off on her own fits best – Grace.\n\n4. MOTIVE.  \n   – Maybelle is the one who is short of money, so at first she looks like the obvious thief.  \n   – But she could not have handled the card and the purchases fit Grace’s size, not necessarily Maybelle’s.  \n   – Grace had the card in her hand, realised there was nothing to stop her using it (her own father might see her charges, Joan’s father would not) and yielded to temptation.  “Means” may be rich, but rich children often dislike parental scrutiny of their spending.\n\n5. SIGNATURES.  \n   – Both stores have the same forged signature, proving one person made both purchases.  \n   – Whoever it was never tried to imitate Joan’s real hand – she simply scribbled.  Someone who had just lifted the card on impulse (Grace) would do exactly that.\n\nLogical chain:  \nOnly Grace (a) had the card in her fingers, (b) has the stature/foot size, (c) was alone for the two purchases, and (d) fits the witnesses’ description.  Therefore she is the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGrace Means, Maybelle Johnson, Laura Parsons\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nGrace Means\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring lunch Joan and Grace both handed over credit cards to the waiter so they could “split the check.”  \nWhen the waiter returned the cards Grace purposely (or at least knowingly) slipped Joan’s MasterCard into her own wallet as well as reclaiming her own.  Joan, distracted by conversation, did not notice.\n\nAfterwards Grace and Maybelle went shopping together.  Part way through the afternoon Grace excused herself, saying she wanted to look in another shop, and separated from Maybelle.  Alone, she went to Maple Street Fashion Shop and bought a cashmere robe, size Large-Tall, then to Keith’s Shoes for a pair of elegant shoes, size 9½ – her own sizes.  She signed “Joan Colthrop” as carelessly as most people sign a credit-slip these days.\n\nPurchases complete, Grace re-joined Maybelle and the two of them strolled home as planned.  Joan did not discover the loss until the movie ended, so Grace had several safe hours’ head-start.  She intended to repay Joan quietly before the bill arrived, or simply deny knowledge if the forgery was discovered.\n\nCrusher Davis checked the receipts, heard that a single tall girl made the buys, and realised that the only tall girl who had actually handled Joan’s credit card – and who would fit the robe and the shoes – was Grace Means.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nLaura Parsons is eliminated by the physical evidence: at 5´1˝ she could not use a “Large-Tall” robe or shoes size 9½.  She never had the chance to touch Joan’s card while it was out of the purse.\n\nMaybelle Johnson had the motive of being short of money, but she never had an opportunity to pick up the card.  It was never in her hands, and the shop employees saw only one tall girl – if Maybelle had been present Grace would have been seen too.  Nothing links her to the stolen card or the purchases.\n\nThus Grace Means is the sole culprit. </WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Ask Martha realized that it was the letter writer herself, Joan Colthrop, who staged the phony theft of her own credit card! Grace Means was wealthy and had no reason to steal her friend’s credit card. Laura Parsons was simply too short for the purchases of size 9 ½ shoes and a Large (Tall) cashmere robe. It would have been totally out of character for her to do so. She was said to be a hard worker, who earned her own way.\nThat leaves Maybelle Johnson and the letter writer herself, Joan Colthrop. Joan is bitter about Maybelle’s attempt to steal her boyfriend. Like Joan herself, Maybelle is tall. However, she went shopping with Grace, and they walked home together. The salesperson at the Maple Street Fashion Shop was sure that the young woman who bought the cashmere robe was alone.\nThe two charged purchases were made by a single person at the end of the afternoon, surely after the matinee at the Bijou Theater, which Joan Colthrop had attended, was over. Joan had thought, by involving Ask Martha, to avoid going back to either store, where she might be recognized. Instead, she left too many clues - and to spite her friend, was the thief of her own identity!",

I’m so grateful for your help and hope you will use my letter to catch the thief.” The letter ended, “Your faithful reader, Joan Colthrop.” Crusher folded the letter and put it in his pocket. He ambled down the street to Keith’s Shoes and talked with the only salesgirl. The recession may be hurting business, but it made it easier to find salespeople, who were fewer than in better economic times. The salesgirl was new in town, but remembered a tall young woman, who had bought the shoes. “It was after my coffee break, so that must have been just before we closed.” After some prodding the salesgirl went to the office and, with the help of the manager, found the store’s credit card receipt. The signature didn’t look like the one in the letter from Joan Colthrop. The story was similar at the Maple Street Fashion Shop, where a salesman remembered that a tall girl had come in alone towards the end of the afternoon. He supposed he would recognize her again, but then the sales manager intervened and said he hoped that this could be handled quietly. He didn’t want to deter other customers from coming - business was bad enough as it was! The signature on the credit card purchase matched the one at Keith’s Shoes. Crusher Davis smiled, and went back to his office at the Chronicle. He thought about calling Inspector Samuels, but then remembered that Sherlock Holmes didn’t always turn criminals over to the police. It was time to give one young lady the scare of her life, well worth it if she never again tried the sad game of identity theft!",
      "answer_options": "(a) Grace Means; (b) Joan Colthrop; (c) Laura Parsons; (d) Maybelle Johnson",
      "answer": "(b) Joan Colthrop",
      "outcome": "Ask Martha realized that it was the letter writer herself, Joan Colthrop, who staged the phony theft of her own credit card! Grace Means was wealthy and had no reason to steal her friend’s credit card. Laura Parsons was simply too short for the purchases of size 9 ½ shoes and a Large (Tall) cashmere robe. It would have been totally out of character for her to do so. She was said to be a hard worker, who earned her own way.\nThat leaves Maybelle Johnson and the letter writer herself, Joan Colthrop. Joan is bitter about Maybelle’s attempt to steal her boyfriend. Like Joan herself, Maybelle is tall. However, she went shopping with Grace, and they walked home together. The salesperson at the Maple Street Fashion Shop was sure that the young woman who bought the cashmere robe was alone.\nThe two charged purchases were made by a single person at the end of the afternoon, surely after the matinee at the Bijou Theater, which Joan Colthrop had attended, was over. Joan had thought, by involving Ask Martha, to avoid going back to either store, where she might be recognized. Instead, she left too many clues - and to spite her friend, was the thief of her own identity!"
