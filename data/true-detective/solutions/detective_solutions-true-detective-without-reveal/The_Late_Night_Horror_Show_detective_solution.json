    "full_text": "Jack Snyder had two great loves in his life: 1) old fashioned horror films (which by today’s standards are not horror films at all) and 2) his family. His priorities were not necessarily in this order. One of the great joys of Jack’s life was to invite one or more of his grandsons to spend Friday or Saturday night at his home. “Granddad Jack” and his grandsons would select a VHS tape or DVD from his extensive library and watch it in the family room after his wife, Candace, went to bed. The boys loved doing this. They felt like adults staying up later than their grandma. Also, Jack always made sure there was popcorn available. Turning off the family room lights and viewing an old black and white film on the big screen television added to the atmosphere. Andy, Matt and David genuinely enjoyed their granddad’s old films. Dennis, at age seven, the youngest of the boys, did not enjoy the horror films as much as the others, but did like to stay up late and eat popcorn. One Friday evening just after school was out for the summer, Candace and Jack agreed to keep all four boys for the weekend so their parents could take a three-day mini vacation – alone. The boys ranged in age from 13-year-old Andy to 7-year-old Dennis. 11-year-old Matthew was especially excited as it was his turn to pick out what they would view on this early June Friday night. After dinner, Jack and the boys went upstairs to his office library, a converted bedroom where he kept his collection in what used to be the bedroom closet. The closet doors had been removed for ease of access and the boys never tired of looking at it. Jack placed great emphasis on keeping the tapes and DVDs chronicled and placed in alphabetical order. Tonight, as always, every film in his library was accounted for and in its proper place. After much deliberation, Matthew selected Fall of the House of Usher, a 1960 film starring the great Vincent Price as the tormented Roderick Usher. This was one of Jack’s favorites. He was delighted that it was one of Matthew’s as well -- he had selected this film several times when it was his turn to choose. They took the DVD downstairs and placed it by the television in the family room. Jack and the boys were all set for what they referred to as their “Late Night Horror Show.” But, before grandma’s bedtime the evening lay before them. The Snyder’s backyard was huge and was the place of many family gatherings. Jack played with the boys outside on the swing set and also engaged the boys in pitch and catch. Candace sat in the sandbox with Dennis, who would shortly be too old to enjoy this any longer. Candace lamented that David had tired of it at about the same age Dennis is now. The six of them stayed outside until dark, a little over two hours. David went inside once to get soft drinks for everyone. At 9:00 p.m., the family came inside to clean up and watch television until grandma’s bedtime. The boys took turns showering and changing clothes in the downstairs bathroom. Jack dozed off in his chair as they prepared for the night. Candace was busy getting the boys clean clothes and watching bits of the news. After showering, Andy hobbled painfully to the kitchen for an apple. Candace gave him permission to sleep downstairs because he had twisted his ankle playing outside, and it was painful for him to climb the stairs. Matthew went upstairs to find his toothbrush but quickly yelled for Candace to come upstairs and help him find it. Matthew’s overnight bag was in the guest bedroom opposite the top of the stairs, and she observed him searching in vain for the toothbrush. As Candace’s bedtime approached, Jack went upstairs to turn off his computer, when he noticed his VHS copy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman was missing from its place on the first row shelf. This was another of his favorites, a 1957 B horror/science fiction film starring the cult scream queen, Allison Hayes. Jack knew immediately what had happened: One of his grandsons had given in to the temptation to borrow one of his films. He wasn’t exactly mad, but was mildly annoyed as he had asked all of them not to do this numerous times. He was pleased that his grandsons shared his passion for these old films, though he wanted them to have more respect for his wishes. Going back downstairs, he called the family together and explained what he had found. Looking at all four of his grandsons, he said, “Fall of the House of Usher will begin when Attack of the 50 Foot Woman is returned to me.” Nobody said anything. Finally, Candace said, “I have seen and heard everything tonight. I know who has that silly film.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Where and when could the theft have happened?\n   • The cassette was on the top-row shelf in Jack’s upstairs office.  \n   • At 6-ish p.m. all six people were in that room picking out “Fall of the House of Usher.”  \n   • Jack states that at that moment every film was still present, so the theft must have taken place later, between their leaving the room and Jack’s return at about 10 p.m.\n\n2. Who went upstairs – and when?\n   • After they came back inside at 9 p.m. only two people are ever reported upstairs:\n       – Matthew, who ran up to look for his toothbrush and immediately yelled for Candace.  \n       – Candace herself, who joined Matthew and stayed with him while he searched.\n     While those two were together Jack’s cassette was already gone, so neither of them had a chance to enter Jack’s office unaccompanied.\n\n   • Andy could not climb the stairs after twisting his ankle and never left the first floor later that evening.\n\n   • Dennis never left the first floor and, at seven, is too young to be interested in a B-movie on an obsolete format.\n\n   • The only other person who was in the house alone was David.  While the others were still outside, David “went inside once to get soft drinks for everyone.”  At that time the house—including the upstairs office—was completely unguarded.\n\n3. How could Candace be so certain?\n   • From the sandbox she could see (and hear) the back door and the upstairs windows.  \n   • She “saw and heard everything”: she watched David re-enter the house; a minute later she heard footsteps overhead—proof that David had gone upstairs, not just into the kitchen.  \n   • When he re-emerged with the drinks she noticed the bulging pocket of his windbreaker.  A VHS cassette is bulky, and a half-hidden black rectangle would hardly escape a grandmother’s notice.\n\n4. Motive\n   • David is the only grandson whose taste in movies is never mentioned.  Unlike Matthew and Andy, he had not yet had a chance to choose a film that night.  Borrowing “Attack of the 50 Foot Woman” would give him something new and exciting to watch later.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAndy Snyder, Matthew Snyder, David Snyder, Dennis Snyder\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nDavid Snyder\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• About 7 p.m. all four boys leave the office with Granddad; the shelves are still complete.  \n• Between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. the family plays in the back yard.  David asks to fetch soft drinks.  \n• Inside the empty house David hurries upstairs, removes “Attack of the 50 Foot Woman” from the first-row shelf, stuffs the VHS tape into the pocket of his jacket, then goes to the kitchen and returns outside carrying the drinks.  \n• Candace, still in the sandbox with Dennis, hears the footsteps above her and sees David’s brief appearance in an upstairs window, realising he has gone well beyond the kitchen.  \n• Later, while Matthew and Candace are together upstairs searching for a toothbrush, Jack discovers the missing cassette.  \n• When Jack gathers the family, Candace can confidently announce that she “saw and heard everything tonight” and therefore knows David must have the tape.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAndy Snyder – After twisting his ankle he could not manage the stairs.  From that moment on he never left the first floor, so he had no opportunity to enter Jack’s upstairs office.\n\nMatthew Snyder – He was on the second floor only while calling for, and then accompanied by, Candace.  He had no solitary access to Jack’s office.\n\nDennis Snyder – The seven-year-old never went upstairs at all and is explicitly described as not enjoying these old horror films.\n\nCandace Snyder – She was busy with the children’s clothes, watching television and later upstairs with Matthew.  She had no motive to hide a movie from her husband and, in fact, is the person who solves the mystery.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
