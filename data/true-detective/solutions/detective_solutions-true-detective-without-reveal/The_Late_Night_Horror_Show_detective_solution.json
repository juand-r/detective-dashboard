    "full_text": "Jack Snyder had two great loves in his life: 1) old fashioned horror films (which by today’s standards are not horror films at all) and 2) his family. His priorities were not necessarily in this order. One of the great joys of Jack’s life was to invite one or more of his grandsons to spend Friday or Saturday night at his home. “Granddad Jack” and his grandsons would select a VHS tape or DVD from his extensive library and watch it in the family room after his wife, Candace, went to bed. The boys loved doing this. They felt like adults staying up later than their grandma. Also, Jack always made sure there was popcorn available. Turning off the family room lights and viewing an old black and white film on the big screen television added to the atmosphere. Andy, Matt and David genuinely enjoyed their granddad’s old films. Dennis, at age seven, the youngest of the boys, did not enjoy the horror films as much as the others, but did like to stay up late and eat popcorn. One Friday evening just after school was out for the summer, Candace and Jack agreed to keep all four boys for the weekend so their parents could take a three-day mini vacation – alone. The boys ranged in age from 13-year-old Andy to 7-year-old Dennis. 11-year-old Matthew was especially excited as it was his turn to pick out what they would view on this early June Friday night. After dinner, Jack and the boys went upstairs to his office library, a converted bedroom where he kept his collection in what used to be the bedroom closet. The closet doors had been removed for ease of access and the boys never tired of looking at it. Jack placed great emphasis on keeping the tapes and DVDs chronicled and placed in alphabetical order. Tonight, as always, every film in his library was accounted for and in its proper place. After much deliberation, Matthew selected Fall of the House of Usher, a 1960 film starring the great Vincent Price as the tormented Roderick Usher. This was one of Jack’s favorites. He was delighted that it was one of Matthew’s as well -- he had selected this film several times when it was his turn to choose. They took the DVD downstairs and placed it by the television in the family room. Jack and the boys were all set for what they referred to as their “Late Night Horror Show.” But, before grandma’s bedtime the evening lay before them. The Snyder’s backyard was huge and was the place of many family gatherings. Jack played with the boys outside on the swing set and also engaged the boys in pitch and catch. Candace sat in the sandbox with Dennis, who would shortly be too old to enjoy this any longer. Candace lamented that David had tired of it at about the same age Dennis is now. The six of them stayed outside until dark, a little over two hours. David went inside once to get soft drinks for everyone. At 9:00 p.m., the family came inside to clean up and watch television until grandma’s bedtime. The boys took turns showering and changing clothes in the downstairs bathroom. Jack dozed off in his chair as they prepared for the night. Candace was busy getting the boys clean clothes and watching bits of the news. After showering, Andy hobbled painfully to the kitchen for an apple. Candace gave him permission to sleep downstairs because he had twisted his ankle playing outside, and it was painful for him to climb the stairs. Matthew went upstairs to find his toothbrush but quickly yelled for Candace to come upstairs and help him find it. Matthew’s overnight bag was in the guest bedroom opposite the top of the stairs, and she observed him searching in vain for the toothbrush. As Candace’s bedtime approached, Jack went upstairs to turn off his computer, when he noticed his VHS copy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman was missing from its place on the first row shelf. This was another of his favorites, a 1957 B horror/science fiction film starring the cult scream queen, Allison Hayes. Jack knew immediately what had happened: One of his grandsons had given in to the temptation to borrow one of his films. He wasn’t exactly mad, but was mildly annoyed as he had asked all of them not to do this numerous times. He was pleased that his grandsons shared his passion for these old films, though he wanted them to have more respect for his wishes. Going back downstairs, he called the family together and explained what he had found. Looking at all four of his grandsons, he said, “Fall of the House of Usher will begin when Attack of the 50 Foot Woman is returned to me.” Nobody said anything. Finally, Candace said, “I have seen and heard everything tonight. I know who has that silly film.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  The tape was in its proper place when Jack and the boys chose “Fall of the House of Usher.”  \n2.  The next time Jack looked – just before Candace’s bedtime – it was gone.  Therefore it was taken in the interval between those two moments.  \n3.  During that interval the family spent two hours outside.  Only David went into the house, but Candace was still outside, so she could not honestly say she had “seen and heard everything” at that moment.  Her later statement must refer to what happened after the family came back indoors.  \n4.  Once the family was indoors Jack stayed downstairs and dozed.  Andy, because of his badly twisted ankle, hobbled around the first floor and was excused from climbing the stairs.  Dennis never left Candace’s sight.  \n5.  The only person who went upstairs alone after the outdoor play was Matthew.  He announced he had to find his toothbrush, went up, then called grandma for “help.”  \n6.  Candace went upstairs and actually watched him hunting through his overnight bag.  That means she both saw and heard him while he was up there.  \n7.  The library that holds the videos is only a few steps from the guest bedroom where Matthew’s bag was.  He had every opportunity – before calling grandma – to duck into Grand-dad’s library, pull the first-row VHS “Attack of the 50 Foot Woman,” and slip it into his bag.  \n8.  Candace, standing in the bedroom doorway while he rummaged, could easily notice the tell-tale black VHS box among his clothes, or simply realise that Matthew was the only person who had the chance to take the tape.  \nHence the thief is Matthew (Matt) Snyder.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAndy Snyder, Matthew (Matt) Snyder, David Snyder, Dennis Snyder\n</SUPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMatthew “Matt” Snyder\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter everyone chose “Fall of the House of Usher,” the tape collection was intact.  \nWhile the family was outside, nothing happened to the library.  \nWhen they came back inside, Matthew decided he would like to take home one of Grand-dad’s favourites, “Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.”  \nHe invented an excuse – his “missing” toothbrush – and went upstairs alone.  \nInside the open closet library he grabbed the VHS (the first one on the top shelf), then crossed the hallway into the guest bedroom and slipped it into his overnight bag.  \nTo make his presence upstairs look innocent he loudly called, “Grandma, can you help me find my toothbrush?”  \nCandace came up, helped him search, noticed the incriminating tape in the bag (or at least realised Matthew was the only one who could have taken it), but said nothing until Jack confronted the boys.  \nWhen Jack announced the tape was missing, Candace calmly stated that she had “seen and heard everything” and therefore knew it had to be Matthew.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Andy Snyder – His painful ankle kept him on the ground floor after the outdoor accident; he never went upstairs again, so he had no opportunity.  \n• David Snyder – He went into the house once while the rest were outside, but at that time Candace was outside and could not truthfully claim she “saw and heard everything.”  The tape was still in place then; it disappeared later.  \n• Dennis Snyder – The seven-year-old stayed with Candace the whole evening, never going upstairs on his own, and could not have reached or concealed the tape without being noticed.  \nTherefore none of them had both the opportunity and Candace’s direct observation; only Matthew did.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
