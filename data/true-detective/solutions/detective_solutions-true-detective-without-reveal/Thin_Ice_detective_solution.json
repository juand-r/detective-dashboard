    "full_text": "“Here she goes, boys!” Tom Carlson called, turning on the hose and letting the water loose. He triumphantly swept the hose back and forth, spraying water onto the plastic liner of the hockey rink he’d built in his own backyard with the help of his son, Tom Junior. The rink was 1/4 scale of an NHL rink, complete with wooden boards, Plexiglass partitions, floodlights and even an electronic scoreboard mounted at one end. It had taken the two Toms all summer and fall to build, and now, with temperatures plummeting, it was finally ready to be put into operation. “Just think,” Tom Sr. said, throwing an arm around his son’s shoulders, as he guided the hose with the other, “you’ll be able to practice and play all winter long, right here in your own backyard. Just like Wayne Gretzky when he was your age!” “Super, Dad!” Tom Jr., known as TJ, enthused. The spunky eleven year-old was an even bigger hockey aficionado than his father, following the local AHL team, the Manitoba Moose, with true fan fervor. “Yep, you are one lucky pucky,” Mikey Chanowski marveled. “My dad won’t even let me play badminton in our backyard.” Mikey was one of TJ’s friends, over to watch the big hose down. “Well, you can come over and play with TJ anytime you want,” Tom said, “between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.” “How long before the ice freezes properly and we can start skating on it, Mr. Carlson?” Shea Callaghan, another of TJ’s friends asked. “Well, it’s supposed to go down to minus twenty tonight – warm for this time of year in Winnipeg, but still cold enough – so it should be frozen solid by morning for sure.” “Awesome!” Shea yelped. “What’s the time now, Mr. Carlson? My parents can’t afford a backyard hockey rink, but they’re taking me to the game tonight. Maybe the Moose will finally break out of their losing streak.” Tom flipped his wrist and glanced at his watch, accidentally giving Mikey an ice-water face-wash in the process. “Whoops! Sorry, Mikey. Uh, it’s almost six-thirty, Shea.” “Gotta go,” the skinny youngster in the Winnipeg Jets jersey said. “See you around, TJ.” “Yeah,” Mikey said, “I guess I better get going, too.” He sneezed, wiping his nose on the same Boston Bruins’ parka sleeve he’d just dried his face on. “Meet you back here to walk to school in the morning, like usual?” TJ asked. Mikey lived just down the street, Shea a couple of blocks over. “You can check out the rink with the ice all in.” “Sure.” The ear muffed redhead let loose another sneeze. “Later, gator!” Father and son stood watch, as the streaming, steaming water flooded the rink, slowly crystallizing their dreams of backyard shinny. “So, you two hosers are actually going ahead with it, eh?” Tom and TJ glanced at their next-door-neighbor, Joe Tucker, who’d wandered into their yard uninvited. Joe ‘Blow’ (as Tom called the whining windbag) had groused his concerns many a time previous about the prospective noise level from having a bunch of kids playing hockey so close to his property and about the possibility of frozen pucks flying into his yard and maybe through his windows. He sniffed at the swirling water, nose held high. “Yup, we’re almost ready to face-off for the first time,” TJ bragged, beaming up at his dad. “Humph!” Joe harrumphed. “Just keep the noise and the pucks down, is all I ask. Or I’m calling the cops.” He turned to leave, and slipped on a puddle of ice, landing on his amply padded rear end with a thump. “Ooohhh!” he moaned, as TJ rushed over to help him back to his feet. Tom kept right on watering the rink. “That’s just great for my aching back,” Joe groaned, “I already can hardly lift a thing at work!” “That reminds me, Dad,” TJ said, “I better go sand Mrs. Lacombe’s steps before she goes out to get the paper in the morning. It’s pretty icy around here.” “Merci, TJ!” Hortence Lacombe called from over the neighboring fence on the other side, where she’d been watching the proceedings. “You’re such a good boy to remember an old lady. You’re going to grow up to be another Maurice ‘Rocket’ Richard with your new hockey rink, no?” Rocket Richard was Hortence’s favorite hockey player – her father had taken her to see the hall-of-famer play at the old Montreal Forum when she was just a child, many, many years ago. “More like Alexandre Bolduc,” TJ replied, naming his favorite player on the current Moose roster. * TJ was up at the crack of dawn the following morning, anxious to see the new ice on the new rink. He listened to the sportscast on the radio as he threw on his clothes, cheering when he heard that his beloved Moose had finally broken out of their slump with a late goal in overtime. Then he pulled on his boots and parka and raced out into the backyard. His father was standing by the hockey rink, his shoulders slumped. “Someone vandalized our new rink last night,” the man groaned. “Poured salt all over the ice – ruined it!” TJ stared at the cratered and pockmarked ice surface, where the salt had melted through it, at the empty twenty-five pound bag of road salt that had blown into a corner of the messed-up rink. The salt was a commonplace brand that people all over Manitoba used on their driveways and walkways and steps in the wintertime to melt ice and improve traction. “Telephone, TJ!” his mom called from the backdoor. It was Mikey Chanowski’s mother, informing TJ that Mikey wouldn’t be stopping by his house to walk with him to school, since he was sick in bed with the flu. “That’s tough,” TJ responded. “Yes, it is,” Mikey’s mother agreed. “He was sneezing and coughing so badly when he got back from your house last night, I had to put him straight to bed.” No sooner had TJ hung up, than the phone rang again. This time it was Shea, asking when he could come over to play hockey. “Cool your jets, Golden Jet,” TJ replied dejectedly. “Someone ruined the ice.” He sighed. “How was the Moose game, anyway?” “Ruined the ice!” Shea shrieked over the phone. “Ah, man, that reeks! The Moose game wasn’t bad – same old, same old, ya know.” TJ hung up for a second time. Then he wandered back out into the backyard to stare at the scarred and pitted ice surface with his father again. “If it’s any consolation, Dad,” he said, “I know who did this.” Tom glanced down at his son, surprised. “You do? Who?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. List every character who conceivably could have emptied a 25-lb bag of road-salt on the new ice some time between 6:30 p.m. and the Carlsons’ bedtime.\n\n   a. Joe Tucker – the crabby next-door neighbour who has loudly objected to the rink.  \n   b. Mikey Chanowski – TJ’s buddy who got an accidental face-wash from the hose and was already sneezing.  \n   c. Shea Callaghan – the other friend who said he was going to the Manitoba Moose game with his parents.  \n   d. Hortence Lacombe – the sweet elderly neighbour.  \n   e. Tom Sr. or TJ themselves – theoretically, but they have no reason.\n\n2. Motive\n   • Joe: strong motive – hates the thought of noise and flying pucks.  \n   • Mikey: mild motive – a little envy, but Mr. Carlson invited him to use the rink any time.  \n   • Shea: real motive – jealous (“My parents can’t afford a backyard hockey rink”).  \n   • Hortence/ the Carlsons: none.\n\n3. Opportunity / alibis\n   • Joe lives a few metres away, so opportunity is obvious, but he complains that after his fall “I already can hardly lift a thing.” A 25-lb bag would be painful for someone with a bad back.\n   • Mikey went home about 6:30 and, according to his mother’s morning phone-call, was put straight to bed with the flu. Very unlikely he sneaked back out.\n   • Shea left at 6:30 saying he was going to the game. The crucial point: next morning TJ hears on the radio that the Moose finally WON in overtime, snapping their losing streak. Yet when TJ asks Shea, the boy says, “The Moose game wasn’t bad – same old, same old, ya know.” Anyone who had really been there (or even listened to the post-game show) would be jubilant, not indifferent. His answer shows he never went to the arena. Ergo he had the time to return with a bag of salt and wreck the ice.\n   • Hortence keeps sand on her steps (TJ was going to “sand Mrs. Lacombe’s steps”) – not salt – and she would hardly haul a 25-lb bag across a yard at her age.\n\n4. Physical evidence\n   • Common brand road-salt bag – something every Winnipeg household (except Mrs. Lacombe’s) is apt to have.\n   • Weight of the bag: an athletic 11-year-old like Shea can drag or carry it; an old lady or an injured man would struggle.\n\n5. What made TJ sure?\n   Two back-to-back phone calls.  \n   – Call #1: Mikey’s mum gives Mikey a solid alibi.  \n   – Call #2: Shea’s off-hand description of the game contradicts the dramatic radio report TJ has just heard. Instantly TJ realises Shea lied about attending the game and therefore had both motive and opportunity.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJoe Tucker, Mikey Chanowski, Shea Callaghan, Hortence Lacombe\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nShea Callaghan\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• 6:30 p.m. – Shea leaves the Carlson yard, telling everyone he is off to the Moose game with his parents.  \n• Instead of going to the arena, he goes home, stewing over the fact that TJ will have a private rink while he has none.  \n• Sometime later that evening, Shea drags a 25-lb bag of road-salt from his family’s supply, slips back into the dark Carlson yard and climbs over the boards.  \n• He scatters the entire bag over the still-wet surface. The wind blows the empty bag into a corner of the rink.  \n• By morning the salt has eaten craters all through the ice.  \n• Next morning, when TJ phones, Shea pretends he was at the game but gives himself away by saying it was “same old, same old,” proving he has no idea the Moose won in overtime.  \n• TJ instantly recognises the lie and therefore the culprit.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJoe Tucker: Strong motive but a very sore back; lifting a 25-lb bag would be agony. No fresh clues link him to the salt, and TJ’s certainty comes only after two telephone calls – neither of which involved Joe.\n\nMikey Chanowski: His mother’s call establishes that he was put to bed sick immediately on returning home. TJ’s deduction comes after hearing this alibi, so Mikey can’t be the vandal.\n\nHortence Lacombe: She uses sand, not salt, on her steps, likes TJ and his rink, and has no motive or physical ability to drag a big salt bag across the snow.\n\nTom Sr., TJ: Obviously they would not destroy their own months of work.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

But in his phone call to TJ the next morning, he proved that he’d lied about that: he indicated that the Moose had boringly lost again, when, in fact, they’d actually won an exciting game, as TJ had heard on the radio, and as anyone actually at the game would’ve known.

It’s pretty icy around here.” “Merci, TJ!” Hortence Lacombe called from over the neighboring fence on the other side, where she’d been watching the proceedings. “You’re such a good boy to remember an old lady. You’re going to grow up to be another Maurice ‘Rocket’ Richard with your new hockey rink, no?” Rocket Richard was Hortence’s favorite hockey player – her father had taken her to see the hall-of-famer play at the old Montreal Forum when she was just a child, many, many years ago. “More like Alexandre Bolduc,” TJ replied, naming his favorite player on the current Moose roster. * TJ was up at the crack of dawn the following morning, anxious to see the new ice on the new rink. He listened to the sportscast on the radio as he threw on his clothes, cheering when he heard that his beloved Moose had finally broken out of their slump with a late goal in overtime. Then he pulled on his boots and parka and raced out into the backyard. His father was standing by the hockey rink, his shoulders slumped. “Someone vandalized our new rink last night,” the man groaned. “Poured salt all over the ice – ruined it!” TJ stared at the cratered and pockmarked ice surface, where the salt had melted through it, at the empty twenty-five pound bag of road salt that had blown into a corner of the messed-up rink. The salt was a commonplace brand that people all over Manitoba used on their driveways and walkways and steps in the wintertime to melt ice and improve traction. “Telephone, TJ!” his mom called from the backdoor. It was Mikey Chanowski’s mother, informing TJ that Mikey wouldn’t be stopping by his house to walk with him to school, since he was sick in bed with the flu. “That’s tough,” TJ responded. “Yes, it is,” Mikey’s mother agreed. “He was sneezing and coughing so badly when he got back from your house last night, I had to put him straight to bed.” No sooner had TJ hung up, than the phone rang again. This time it was Shea, asking when he could come over to play hockey. “Cool your jets, Golden Jet,” TJ replied dejectedly. “Someone ruined the ice.” He sighed. “How was the Moose game, anyway?” “Ruined the ice!” Shea shrieked over the phone. “Ah, man, that reeks! The Moose game wasn’t bad – same old, same old, ya know.” TJ hung up for a second time. Then he wandered back out into the backyard to stare at the scarred and pitted ice surface with his father again. “If it’s any consolation, Dad,” he said, “I know who did this.” Tom glanced down at his son, surprised. “You do? Who?”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Hortence Lacombe; (b) Joe Tucker; (c) Mikey Chanowski; (d) Shea Callaghan",
      "answer": "(d) Shea Callaghan",
      "outcome": "The de-icer had to be one of the four who knew that Tom Carlson and his son had flooded their new hockey rink the previous evening, as the chances of a random vandal walking around outside on a cold night with a twenty-five pound bag of road salt would be slim.\nIt wasn’t Joe Tucker, because his bad back meant there was no way he could lift a twenty-five pound bag of anything. It wasn’t Hortence Lacombe, because she had no salt – she relied on sand from TJ to keep her steps from being slippery. And it wasn’t Mikey Chanowski, because he was sick in bed with the flu all of the previous evening and following morning.\nShea Callaghan claimed that he’d gone to the hockey game with his parents the night of the crime. But in his phone call to TJ the next morning, he proved that he’d lied about that: he indicated that the Moose had boringly lost again, when, in fact, they’d actually won an exciting game, as TJ had heard on the radio, and as anyone actually at the game would’ve known. He had no reason to lie about attending the hockey game, unless it was to cover up his attendance at the crime scene."
