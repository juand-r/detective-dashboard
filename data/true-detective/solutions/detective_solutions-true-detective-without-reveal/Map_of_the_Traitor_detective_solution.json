    "full_text": "The sun rose as George Washington rode by – tall, proud, and respected by his men. Nate rode slowly towards him, delivering an important message from the Virginia militia. In the woods, an owl hooted as the American soldiers passed on their horses, disturbing its sleep. It was early on a hot morning in July, 1780. “The British would split our army into two smaller pieces,” General Washington was saying. “But they can't! They can't travel up the river, since we've fortified the fort at West Point.” Bright sunshine sparkled on a lake as Nate approached with his message. Like everyone, Nate revered General Washington. Nearly 6,000 British soldiers had surrendered to Washington's troops at the battle of Saratoga three years earlier. But now Nate was bringing the General bad news, and as his horse clomped up the muddy farmland road, he nervously hoped that it wouldn't make his leader angry. As Nate approached, he recognized the famous general from his blue coat and three-cornered hat. “What's your name?” the general asked. “Jate Nackson,” he said nervously. “I mean, Nate Jackson.” General Washington smiled and asked if the Virginia militia was sending more troops. “Only 200, sir.” Nate saw little hint of disappointment in the general's face. It seemed Washington's success always depended on his strategy, not his resources. But suddenly, they spotted a messenger galloping towards them on a white horse. “Sir!” the messenger shouted. “The British are planning to attack our West Point fort tonight.” “But how?” “A traitor has given them a detailed map!” General Washington was alarmed, and asked for more information. Panting for breath, the messenger told his story: “It was midnight in the woods when the British major received the map,” he said quickly. “The major hid the map in his boot and disguised himself in American clothing, traveling all night on a secret path through the woods.” A worried silence fell over the group of soldiers. “As the sun rose, he was spotted making his escape on foot. And he's traveling down this very road!” General Washington turned suddenly to Nate. “Did you spend this morning riding towards us on this road?” Nate nodded quickly. “Then you must've passed the British major. We can still capture him – if we know what he looks like!” “But General,” Nate stammered, “I passed four men on the road! Any one of them could've been the British major in disguise.” He hated to disappoint General Washington again, but unfortunately, it was the truth. “There's only one thing to do,” the messenger said. “The fate of the American army depends on it, and maybe the fate of America itself. We must identify and capture the British major – and fast.” Within minutes, Nate was galloping down the road with some of General Washington's best soldiers. But could they locate the traitor's map? Suddenly, they spotted the first traveler on the road. Nate remembered seeing this man. He was traveling fast, and wearing a heavy cotton shirt. “Good morning,” the soldiers called out. “What's good about it?” the old man complained. “This heat brings mosquitoes. I only hope I don't catch a disease!” Sweat had soaked his shirt, and mud covered his humble trousers and bare feet. The soldiers laughed politely at the man's obvious discomfort. The man said his name was Edward, and that he'd been farming the land along the road for 15 years. “And I still don't like this weather!” “Look!” said Nate, pointing to another traveler, just a half mile up the road. They had barely noticed him, since his brown shirt blended with the mud around him. Leaving two soldiers to bring Edward behind them, Nate galloped quickly towards the figure with the rest of the soldiers. They discovered a young man in a thin brown shirt and leather vest. He glared at the soldiers as they arrived, and seemed uninterested in their mission. When they asked him where he was headed, he replied: “What business is it of yours?” He seemed like the wealthy son of a merchant. “What's your name?” Nate asked politely. “Lucius,” he said, sullenly, but he was clearly angry with the soldiers. “How old are you?” “Seventeen, and I hope the British beat your army,” he declared, “and soon!” “You're supporting the British?\" Nate asked. “Lots of people do,” Lucius replied. “About one out of every six people is supporting the British. War disrupts trading. I may be only a teenager, but I know that trading is what feeds my family!” Nate could understand his bitterness. With two soldiers escorting Lucius, the men rode on. The sun was getting even hotter as they passed a wide field of wheat. But soon, far ahead, they spotted a cloud of dust on the road. Nate and the soldiers galloped faster towards the cloud, discovering it came from a trotting grey horse and its shaggy-haired rider. The man's clothes were covered with dust, which had even dirtied his long, shaggy hair. “My name's Benjamin,” the man said. “Can I help you?” he asked politely. Nate was pleased that Benjamin was much more friendly than the last traveler they'd met. Benjamin said he planned to travel the road all the way to Charleston so he could visit his nephew. “It's a long way, but I figured I'd take my time,” he laughed. “I'm going just until I can find a shady tree to eat lunch under!” It did sound like a reasonable plan. But when Nate looked down the road ahead, he thought he'd spotted the fourth traveler. Leaving two soldiers behind, Nate and the others rode their horses up the road. They were soon greeted by a young man in his twenties, walking slowly down the road. Nate eyed him suspiciously, but the man seemed friendly enough. “Hello!” he said as Nate approached. “My name's Nate.” “Well, my name's Jonathan!” He extended his hand for a hearty handshake. Jonathan had short, yellow hair, and he shielded his eyes as he looked up at Nate. The midday sun was bright, as it was now nearly noon; but Jonathan's eyes were also red, and lined with dark circles. Jonathan said he was traveling to the Virginia coast, where he hoped to find work as a sailor. “It's a hard road to travel,” said Jonathan. “But an honest road.” Nate sat on his horse, thinking about the four travelers they'd met. The American army might be destroyed unless he determined which traveler was secretly a major in the British army. As the soldiers gathered the suspects, his eyes lit up with excitement, “I know who has the traitor's map!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What we already know  \n •  A British major, carrying a map of West Point, set off AT MIDNIGHT.  \n •  He hid the map “in his boot,” put on American clothes, and “travelled all night on a secret path through the woods.”  \n •  “As the sun rose he was spotted ON FOOT,” and now, a few hours later, he must still be somewhere on this very road.  \n\n2. What that tells us to look for  \n •  Someone who is still travelling on foot (the messenger never said he found a horse).  \n •  Someone who is wearing BOOTS in which a map could still be hidden.  \n •  Someone who shows the physical effects of having been awake and moving all night through woods – dust, exhaustion, red eyes, etc.  \n •  Someone whose present destination would make sense for a British officer who needs to reach a BRITISH SHIP (the coast).\n\n3. Examine the four people Nate meets\n\n Edward – Bare-foot farmer, shirt soaked with sweat, trousers muddy.  No boots → no hiding place for the map.  Lives along the road 15 years, complains about mosquitoes; nothing indicates an all-night trek through woods.\n\n Lucius – 17-year-old merchant’s son.  Angry, openly pro-British, but far too young to be “a MAJOR.”  No sign of extreme fatigue; clothes are clean enough to have come only from the road, not a night in thick woods.\n\n Benjamin – Middle-aged man on a grey horse, clothes and hair dusty.  He is riding, joking, taking “his time,” intends to stop for lunch.  Someone who has just walked all night would not have the strength to mount and then trot a horse for hours and still be light-hearted.  (He could have stolen the horse, but there is no sign of urgency and he gives a long-distance story – “all the way to Charleston” – that would not get the map to the British quickly.)\n\n Jonathan – Young man in his twenties, travelling ON FOOT.  Short yellow (blond) hair is dusty; eyes are “red and lined with dark circles” – classic signs of no sleep.  He shields his eyes from “the bright midday sun” after an all-night march.  His chosen goal is “the Virginia coast,” exactly where His Majesty’s fleet is operating.  He still has the heavy boots a soldier would wear; perfect place to keep the hidden map.\n\n4. Historical echo  \n All the details match the real 1780 incident in which Major JOHN ANDRÉ, travelling under the alias “John Anderson,” was caught with Benedict Arnold’s West Point plans in his boot.  “Jonathan” is almost the same first name, and his appearance (tired, on foot, heading for the coast) fits André far better than any other traveller.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n Only Jonathan satisfies ALL of the required conditions simultaneously: on foot, wearing boots, visibly exhausted from a night march through rough country, and moving toward the British lines on the coast.  Therefore Jonathan must be the disguised British major.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEdward, Lucius, Benjamin, Jonathan\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJonathan  (real identity: Major John André, alias “Jonathan”)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Shortly after midnight Major John André met Benedict Arnold, received the plan of the West Point fortifications, folded it and hid it inside his boot, then put on plain American clothes.  \n•  He spent the rest of the night picking his way along a little-used woodland path that joins the main road.  \n•  At sunrise local patriots glimpsed a lone man on foot emerging from the woods; one of them rode off to warn Washington.  \n•  André continued down the main road, exhausted but determined to reach the Virginia coast, where a British ship could carry him and the plans to safety.  \n•  Nate Jackson, riding toward Washington, unknowingly passed André soon after dawn.  \n•  A messenger reached Washington, who immediately dispatched Nate and a squad of dragoons back along the road.  \n•  The first three travellers they encountered were ordinary civilians.  \n•  The fourth traveller—“Jonathan”—was in fact André.  His red-rimmed, sleepless eyes, dusty clothes, soldier’s boots, and declared destination gave him away.  When the soldiers arrest him and search his boots they will find the map and expose the plot.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nEdward – He is barefoot; the map was said to be hidden in a boot.  A man who has farmed along the road for 15 years and complains about the weather has no motive or opportunity to have slipped out of West Point at midnight.\n\nLucius – He is openly a Loyalist, but only seventeen years old—too young to be a British major.  He shows no sign of having walked through woods all night, and his clothes are clean compared with Jonathan’s and Benjamin’s.\n\nBenjamin – Although his clothes are dusty, he is on horseback and perfectly cheerful, not the least bit sleep-deprived.  Someone who had trudged through rough woods all night would be exhausted, sore-footed, and unlikely to mount and trot miles on a strange horse.\n\nJonathan – matches every physical and situational clue; therefore the other three, lacking one or more key elements (boots, rank, fatigue, destination), must be innocent.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

The messenger who warned us said that our British major tucked the map into his boot.”\n“Perhaps the third traveler, Benjamin, isn't really traveling to Charleston,” another soldier suggested, “and instead of a shady tree, he's galloping straight towards his British commander!”\n“But he was riding a horse,” Nate pointed out. “Our British major has been traveling by foot, according to the messenger. And, in fact, he told us that the major has been traveling since midnight, with no time for sleeping. I bet he's tired now, and he's got bloodshot eyes surrounded by dark circles.”\nHe pointed the men towards Jonathan, who ran as he saw the soldiers approaching. But the men on horseback quickly surrounded him, searched his boots, and discovered the map to the fort. They also discovered a letter he'd received from an American general named Benedict Arnold. Arnold bragged that he's had himself placed in command of the fort — but only so he could surrender it to the British!\nIt would've been a horrible setback for the American cause.

When they asked him where he was headed, he replied: “What business is it of yours?” He seemed like the wealthy son of a merchant. “What's your name?” Nate asked politely. “Lucius,” he said, sullenly, but he was clearly angry with the soldiers. “How old are you?” “Seventeen, and I hope the British beat your army,” he declared, “and soon!” “You're supporting the British?\" Nate asked. “Lots of people do,” Lucius replied. “About one out of every six people is supporting the British. War disrupts trading. I may be only a teenager, but I know that trading is what feeds my family!” Nate could understand his bitterness. With two soldiers escorting Lucius, the men rode on. The sun was getting even hotter as they passed a wide field of wheat. But soon, far ahead, they spotted a cloud of dust on the road. Nate and the soldiers galloped faster towards the cloud, discovering it came from a trotting grey horse and its shaggy-haired rider. The man's clothes were covered with dust, which had even dirtied his long, shaggy hair. “My name's Benjamin,” the man said. “Can I help you?” he asked politely. Nate was pleased that Benjamin was much more friendly than the last traveler they'd met. Benjamin said he planned to travel the road all the way to Charleston so he could visit his nephew. “It's a long way, but I figured I'd take my time,” he laughed. “I'm going just until I can find a shady tree to eat lunch under!” It did sound like a reasonable plan. But when Nate looked down the road ahead, he thought he'd spotted the fourth traveler. Leaving two soldiers behind, Nate and the others rode their horses up the road. They were soon greeted by a young man in his twenties, walking slowly down the road. Nate eyed him suspiciously, but the man seemed friendly enough. “Hello!” he said as Nate approached. “My name's Nate.” “Well, my name's Jonathan!” He extended his hand for a hearty handshake. Jonathan had short, yellow hair, and he shielded his eyes as he looked up at Nate. The midday sun was bright, as it was now nearly noon; but Jonathan's eyes were also red, and lined with dark circles. Jonathan said he was traveling to the Virginia coast, where he hoped to find work as a sailor. “It's a hard road to travel,” said Jonathan. “But an honest road.” Nate sat on his horse, thinking about the four travelers they'd met. The American army might be destroyed unless he determined which traveler was secretly a major in the British army. As the soldiers gathered the suspects, his eyes lit up with excitement, “I know who has the traitor's map!”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Benjamin; (b) Edward; (c) Jonathan; (d) Lucius",
      "answer": "(c) Jonathan",
      "outcome": "“It must be Lucius,” said one soldier, “since he hates the American rebels.”\n“But if I were trying to escape, I wouldn't reveal that I supported the British,” Nate said. “Besides, he was clearly just 17 years old. He's too young to be a major in the British army!”\n“I thought Edward looked suspicious,” another soldier suggested, “since he kept trying to remind us how long he'd been farming.”\n“He's a hard-working farmer,” Nate replied, “and besides, he's traveling in his bare feet. The messenger who warned us said that our British major tucked the map into his boot.”\n“Perhaps the third traveler, Benjamin, isn't really traveling to Charleston,” another soldier suggested, “and instead of a shady tree, he's galloping straight towards his British commander!”\n“But he was riding a horse,” Nate pointed out. “Our British major has been traveling by foot, according to the messenger. And, in fact, he told us that the major has been traveling since midnight, with no time for sleeping. I bet he's tired now, and he's got bloodshot eyes surrounded by dark circles.”\nHe pointed the men towards Jonathan, who ran as he saw the soldiers approaching. But the men on horseback quickly surrounded him, searched his boots, and discovered the map to the fort. They also discovered a letter he'd received from an American general named Benedict Arnold. Arnold bragged that he's had himself placed in command of the fort — but only so he could surrender it to the British!\nIt would've been a horrible setback for the American cause. But now that they'd recovered the map and discovered Arnold's secret plan, the fort at West Point would remain safe from attack; and so would the American army.\nBut as the sun crept higher into the Virginia sky, Nate was happy for another reason: He finally had some good news to bring to General Washington."
