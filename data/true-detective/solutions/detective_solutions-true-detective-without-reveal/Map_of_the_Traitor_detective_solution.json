    "full_text": "The sun rose as George Washington rode by – tall, proud, and respected by his men. Nate rode slowly towards him, delivering an important message from the Virginia militia. In the woods, an owl hooted as the American soldiers passed on their horses, disturbing its sleep. It was early on a hot morning in July, 1780. “The British would split our army into two smaller pieces,” General Washington was saying. “But they can't! They can't travel up the river, since we've fortified the fort at West Point.” Bright sunshine sparkled on a lake as Nate approached with his message. Like everyone, Nate revered General Washington. Nearly 6,000 British soldiers had surrendered to Washington's troops at the battle of Saratoga three years earlier. But now Nate was bringing the General bad news, and as his horse clomped up the muddy farmland road, he nervously hoped that it wouldn't make his leader angry. As Nate approached, he recognized the famous general from his blue coat and three-cornered hat. “What's your name?” the general asked. “Jate Nackson,” he said nervously. “I mean, Nate Jackson.” General Washington smiled and asked if the Virginia militia was sending more troops. “Only 200, sir.” Nate saw little hint of disappointment in the general's face. It seemed Washington's success always depended on his strategy, not his resources. But suddenly, they spotted a messenger galloping towards them on a white horse. “Sir!” the messenger shouted. “The British are planning to attack our West Point fort tonight.” “But how?” “A traitor has given them a detailed map!” General Washington was alarmed, and asked for more information. Panting for breath, the messenger told his story: “It was midnight in the woods when the British major received the map,” he said quickly. “The major hid the map in his boot and disguised himself in American clothing, traveling all night on a secret path through the woods.” A worried silence fell over the group of soldiers. “As the sun rose, he was spotted making his escape on foot. And he's traveling down this very road!” General Washington turned suddenly to Nate. “Did you spend this morning riding towards us on this road?” Nate nodded quickly. “Then you must've passed the British major. We can still capture him – if we know what he looks like!” “But General,” Nate stammered, “I passed four men on the road! Any one of them could've been the British major in disguise.” He hated to disappoint General Washington again, but unfortunately, it was the truth. “There's only one thing to do,” the messenger said. “The fate of the American army depends on it, and maybe the fate of America itself. We must identify and capture the British major – and fast.” Within minutes, Nate was galloping down the road with some of General Washington's best soldiers. But could they locate the traitor's map? Suddenly, they spotted the first traveler on the road. Nate remembered seeing this man. He was traveling fast, and wearing a heavy cotton shirt. “Good morning,” the soldiers called out. “What's good about it?” the old man complained. “This heat brings mosquitoes. I only hope I don't catch a disease!” Sweat had soaked his shirt, and mud covered his humble trousers and bare feet. The soldiers laughed politely at the man's obvious discomfort. The man said his name was Edward, and that he'd been farming the land along the road for 15 years. “And I still don't like this weather!” “Look!” said Nate, pointing to another traveler, just a half mile up the road. They had barely noticed him, since his brown shirt blended with the mud around him. Leaving two soldiers to bring Edward behind them, Nate galloped quickly towards the figure with the rest of the soldiers. They discovered a young man in a thin brown shirt and leather vest. He glared at the soldiers as they arrived, and seemed uninterested in their mission. When they asked him where he was headed, he replied: “What business is it of yours?” He seemed like the wealthy son of a merchant. “What's your name?” Nate asked politely. “Lucius,” he said, sullenly, but he was clearly angry with the soldiers. “How old are you?” “Seventeen, and I hope the British beat your army,” he declared, “and soon!” “You're supporting the British?\" Nate asked. “Lots of people do,” Lucius replied. “About one out of every six people is supporting the British. War disrupts trading. I may be only a teenager, but I know that trading is what feeds my family!” Nate could understand his bitterness. With two soldiers escorting Lucius, the men rode on. The sun was getting even hotter as they passed a wide field of wheat. But soon, far ahead, they spotted a cloud of dust on the road. Nate and the soldiers galloped faster towards the cloud, discovering it came from a trotting grey horse and its shaggy-haired rider. The man's clothes were covered with dust, which had even dirtied his long, shaggy hair. “My name's Benjamin,” the man said. “Can I help you?” he asked politely. Nate was pleased that Benjamin was much more friendly than the last traveler they'd met. Benjamin said he planned to travel the road all the way to Charleston so he could visit his nephew. “It's a long way, but I figured I'd take my time,” he laughed. “I'm going just until I can find a shady tree to eat lunch under!” It did sound like a reasonable plan. But when Nate looked down the road ahead, he thought he'd spotted the fourth traveler. Leaving two soldiers behind, Nate and the others rode their horses up the road. They were soon greeted by a young man in his twenties, walking slowly down the road. Nate eyed him suspiciously, but the man seemed friendly enough. “Hello!” he said as Nate approached. “My name's Nate.” “Well, my name's Jonathan!” He extended his hand for a hearty handshake. Jonathan had short, yellow hair, and he shielded his eyes as he looked up at Nate. The midday sun was bright, as it was now nearly noon; but Jonathan's eyes were also red, and lined with dark circles. Jonathan said he was traveling to the Virginia coast, where he hoped to find work as a sailor. “It's a hard road to travel,” said Jonathan. “But an honest road.” Nate sat on his horse, thinking about the four travelers they'd met. The American army might be destroyed unless he determined which traveler was secretly a major in the British army. As the soldiers gathered the suspects, his eyes lit up with excitement, “I know who has the traitor's map!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Information from the messenger  \n   • The British officer is a MAJOR – therefore an adult, not a 17-year-old boy.  \n   • He received the map at midnight, hid it in his BOOT and then walked through the woods.  \n   • At sunrise he was seen “making his escape on foot” down the same road Nate had just ridden.  \n   • If he has marched all night he will be very tired, his eyes blood-shot and ringed.\n\n2. What Nate remembers about each traveller  \n\n   Edward – barefoot, old farmer, complaining about heat and mosquitoes.  No boot → nowhere to hide the map.  \n   Lucius – 17, openly pro-British, sulky but much too young to be a major.  May wear shoes, but no indication of marching all night.  \n   Benjamin – riding a grey horse, long shaggy hair, cheerful, says he is “taking his time”.  The man who was spotted “on foot” at sunrise would hardly have had time to find, saddle and dust-up a horse and still be this far ahead; besides, an officer in disguise would probably cut his hair, not wear it long.  \n   Jonathan – mid-twenties, walking, short hair, red and sleepless eyes, moving slowly because he is exhausted.  The only traveller whose appearance matches “walked all night”.  Old enough to be a major and almost certainly wearing marching boots (a sailor-to-be would need them).  He also slips when giving his name – begins with “My name’s Nate” (perhaps repeating the name he heard earlier) and instantly corrects it to “Jonathan”, just the kind of stumble a man using a false identity makes.\n\n3. Opportunity & motive  \n   Edward and Lucius have no obvious opportunity or rank.  Benjamin’s story takes him hundreds of miles off the strategic route; the British need the map near West Point, not in Charleston.  \n   Jonathan, however, is heading toward the Virginia coast – the quickest way to reach British ships that can sail back up the Hudson and attack West Point.\n\n4. Physical evidence  \n   • Bare feet remove Edward from consideration.  \n   • Jonathan is the only walker whose boots could still conceal the map.  \n   • His lack of sleep and short hair square perfectly with the messenger’s description.\n\nLogical deduction: the traveller whose age, condition, footwear and urgency match every part of the messenger’s account is Jonathan – therefore he is the British major.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEdward, Lucius, Benjamin, Jonathan\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJonathan (alias “Nate”; real identity – British Major)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nJust before midnight a British major met a spy in the woods near West Point and was given a detailed map of the fort’s defences.  He hid the map in one of his boots, put on common American clothes, cut his hair short and started south on foot, hoping to reach the coast and a British ship.\n\nHe trudged all night through the forest track and reached the main road at dawn – the moment an American patrol spotted “a stranger on foot”.  A little later he passed Nate Jackson, who was riding the same road toward General Washington.  Too tired to keep up his earlier pace, the major slowed to a weary walk; by noon his eyes were blood-shot and ringed with dark circles.\n\nWhen Washington’s men came after him, they overtook the other three travellers first – Edward (barefoot farmer), Lucius (teenage Tory), and Benjamin (easy-going horseman).  Finally they reached the real quarry: the exhausted young man who called himself “Jonathan”.  A search of his boots would produce the hidden map and prove his identity as the British major in disguise.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Edward – Barefoot; without boots he could not hide the map.  Age and manner fit a local farmer, not a British officer.  \n• Lucius – Only seventeen; far too young to hold the rank of major.  He voices his loyalty openly, something a spy would never risk.  \n• Benjamin – On horseback and in no hurry; his long shaggy hair does not fit a man who has just donned a soldier’s disguise.  The major was last seen on foot, not on a horse.  \nTherefore none of these three match the description or circumstances of the traitor; only Jonathan does.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

The messenger who warned us said that our British major tucked the map into his boot.”\n“Perhaps the third traveler, Benjamin, isn't really traveling to Charleston,” another soldier suggested, “and instead of a shady tree, he's galloping straight towards his British commander!”\n“But he was riding a horse,” Nate pointed out. “Our British major has been traveling by foot, according to the messenger. And, in fact, he told us that the major has been traveling since midnight, with no time for sleeping. I bet he's tired now, and he's got bloodshot eyes surrounded by dark circles.”\nHe pointed the men towards Jonathan, who ran as he saw the soldiers approaching. But the men on horseback quickly surrounded him, searched his boots, and discovered the map to the fort. They also discovered a letter he'd received from an American general named Benedict Arnold. Arnold bragged that he's had himself placed in command of the fort — but only so he could surrender it to the British!\nIt would've been a horrible setback for the American cause. But now that they'd recovered the map and discovered Arnold's secret plan, the fort at West Point would remain safe from attack; and so would the American army.\nBut as the sun crept higher into the Virginia sky, Nate was happy for another reason: He finally had some good news to bring to General Washington.",

Nate and the soldiers galloped faster towards the cloud, discovering it came from a trotting grey horse and its shaggy-haired rider. The man's clothes were covered with dust, which had even dirtied his long, shaggy hair. “My name's Benjamin,” the man said. “Can I help you?” he asked politely. Nate was pleased that Benjamin was much more friendly than the last traveler they'd met. Benjamin said he planned to travel the road all the way to Charleston so he could visit his nephew. “It's a long way, but I figured I'd take my time,” he laughed. “I'm going just until I can find a shady tree to eat lunch under!” It did sound like a reasonable plan. But when Nate looked down the road ahead, he thought he'd spotted the fourth traveler. Leaving two soldiers behind, Nate and the others rode their horses up the road. They were soon greeted by a young man in his twenties, walking slowly down the road. Nate eyed him suspiciously, but the man seemed friendly enough. “Hello!” he said as Nate approached. “My name's Nate.” “Well, my name's Jonathan!” He extended his hand for a hearty handshake. Jonathan had short, yellow hair, and he shielded his eyes as he looked up at Nate. The midday sun was bright, as it was now nearly noon; but Jonathan's eyes were also red, and lined with dark circles. Jonathan said he was traveling to the Virginia coast, where he hoped to find work as a sailor. “It's a hard road to travel,” said Jonathan. “But an honest road.” Nate sat on his horse, thinking about the four travelers they'd met. The American army might be destroyed unless he determined which traveler was secretly a major in the British army. As the soldiers gathered the suspects, his eyes lit up with excitement, “I know who has the traitor's map!”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Benjamin; (b) Edward; (c) Jonathan; (d) Lucius",
      "answer": "(c) Jonathan",
      "outcome": "“It must be Lucius,” said one soldier, “since he hates the American rebels.”\n“But if I were trying to escape, I wouldn't reveal that I supported the British,” Nate said. “Besides, he was clearly just 17 years old. He's too young to be a major in the British army!”\n“I thought Edward looked suspicious,” another soldier suggested, “since he kept trying to remind us how long he'd been farming.”\n“He's a hard-working farmer,” Nate replied, “and besides, he's traveling in his bare feet. The messenger who warned us said that our British major tucked the map into his boot.”\n“Perhaps the third traveler, Benjamin, isn't really traveling to Charleston,” another soldier suggested, “and instead of a shady tree, he's galloping straight towards his British commander!”\n“But he was riding a horse,” Nate pointed out. “Our British major has been traveling by foot, according to the messenger. And, in fact, he told us that the major has been traveling since midnight, with no time for sleeping. I bet he's tired now, and he's got bloodshot eyes surrounded by dark circles.”\nHe pointed the men towards Jonathan, who ran as he saw the soldiers approaching. But the men on horseback quickly surrounded him, searched his boots, and discovered the map to the fort. They also discovered a letter he'd received from an American general named Benedict Arnold. Arnold bragged that he's had himself placed in command of the fort — but only so he could surrender it to the British!\nIt would've been a horrible setback for the American cause. But now that they'd recovered the map and discovered Arnold's secret plan, the fort at West Point would remain safe from attack; and so would the American army.\nBut as the sun crept higher into the Virginia sky, Nate was happy for another reason: He finally had some good news to bring to General Washington."
