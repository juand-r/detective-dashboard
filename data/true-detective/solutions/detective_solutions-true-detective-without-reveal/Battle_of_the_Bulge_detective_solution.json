    "full_text": "\"Stop here!\" ordered Captain Conrad. \"Look at that signpost. It points in the wrong direction!\" Private Johnson, the captain's driver, squinted through the fog. \"If you say so, sir. I don't remember exactly which way it pointed before.\" \"Well, I do,\" said the captain. \"When we were here three hours ago, it said: turn north for Malmedy and south for Bastogne. Now it says south for Malmedy and north for Bastogne. Pull over and help me turn it back.\" The turned-around signpost meant an enemy spy had been there. German agents in American uniforms were driving captured jeeps behind the American lines, causing havoc and confusion wherever they went. They had all spent time in America as children, so they spoke fluent English with no foreign accent. Turning signs the wrong way was one of their favorite tricks. Back in the jeep, the captain said: \"Let's get back to headquarters now. There's a German spy in the area!\" Too bad the captain didn't have a cell phone. But it was December, 1944 - long before cell phones - and the Battle of the Bulge had just begun. Germany's final surrender was less than five months away, but in the Ardennes Woods of Belgium, American forces were reeling under a furious Nazi assault. The German army had just launched its last major attack of World War Two. Captain Conrad and his driver were heading back to headquarters after a long day in the field when they saw the sabotaged sign. The jeep pulled away from the crossroads. The two soldiers rode silently through narrow, winding mountain roads, the rugged woods around them shrouded in fog and the gathering twilight. Suddenly, an abandoned jeep loomed up at them out of the fog. \"Stop here,\" said the captain. \"I want to check out this jeep. It's not one of ours.\" Conrad got out of his own jeep, and walked around the abandoned one. He touched the hood, then got in the driver's seat. He turned on the ignition, but nothing happened. He looked at some papers in the glove box, then jumped back in his own vehicle. \"The spy who turned that sign must have come in this jeep,\" he told Johnson. \"There are German papers in it. But it's out of gas, so he must be on foot. The engine's still fairly warm, so he couldn't have gotten far.\" \"I don't see any footprints in the woods,\" said Johnson. \"He must have gone on down the road.\" \"There are his footprints,\" said the captain, pointing his flashlight ahead. \"Holy cow! That's the same direction we're going, Captain,\" Johnson exclaimed. \"And headquarters is just a mile up the road. He must be in camp!\" \"I think so, Johnson. So step on it! We need to get back now.\" The sun had just set as Captain Conrad burst through the door into the front hall of the abandoned farmhouse that served as his headquarters. \"Sergeant Polonski! Did any stragglers arrive while I was gone?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Polonski, flipping through his clipboard. \"There were four: Anderson, Dilworth, Maguire, and Siegel. They're down in the shed with Corporal Riley now.\" \"Are you absolutely sure only four came in while I was gone?\" \"Absolutely, sir. I doubled up on sentries the whole time you were gone. Everyone who showed up is in the shed.\" \"Well, round up the extra sentries into a guard detail, and get down to the shed right away,\" said the captain. \"One of those men is a German spy!\" Five minutes later, Sergeant Polonski and the guards met Captain Conrad at the shed. Then they all saw something unusual. Suddenly, five candles in the shed window were lit, one by one. Five small flames twinkled in the gloom. The soldiers outside exchanged quizzical glances, but said nothing. Then Conrad and Polonski stepped inside. \"Ten-HUT!\" cried Corporal Riley as they walked in. \"At ease, corporal. You men, stay at attention,\" the captain told the stragglers. \"Who just lit those candles in the window?\" \"I did, sir,\" said Siegel, one of the stragglers. \"Why? To signal the enemy how many men were in here?\" \"Oh, no sir! They're for the festival of lights!\" \"Where are you from, Siegel? Who's your favorite big-league slugger?\" \"I'm a Yankee fan, sir, from the Bronx, you know, so that's Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Last week I was a battalion clerk, but - that was before the enemy overran us.\" \"At ease, Siegel,\" the captain said. Then he turned to Maguire, who rocked slowly from side to side, sweating and shivering. \"What's wrong with you, soldier? Nervous about something?\" \"No, sir,\" Maguire whispered hoarsely. \"I'm sick. Must be something I ate. I haven't felt this bad since D-Day. I got so seasick when they delayed the invasion, and we rode out that storm in the hold of the ship.\" \"At ease, soldier,\" said the captain. \"Sit down til you feel better.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" replied Maguire, as he slumped into a chair. \"By the way, where are you from and who's your favorite slugger?\" \"I'm from Boston, sir - the home of the bean and the cod. So Ted Williams is my guy.\" Captain Conrad turned to the third straggler. \"Who are you, soldier?\" \"Anderson, sir. I'm a rifleman and Missourian. My dad served in World War One and saw his first action at Chateau-Thierry while my great-granddad saw Lee's rebels surrender to Grant at Appomattox.\" \"Why would your great-granddad fight for the Union? Wasn't Missouri a slave state?\" \"Yes sir, it was a slave state, captain. But anti-slavery sentiment was pretty strong in some parts. So the slavers never took over the state legislature, and the state never seceded from the Union. So Missouri sent some mighty fine regiments to the Grand Old Army, sir - and some to the rebels, too.\" \"Who's your favorite big-league slugger, Anderson?\" \"Well, I'm a St. Louis Cardinals fan, captain. I never much cared for the Browns. So I've got a tough choice between Enos Slaughter and Stan Musial.\" \"At ease, Anderson,\" said the captain, and turned to the fourth straggler. \"What's your story, soldier?\" \"I'm Dilworth, sir. I was an artillery spotter - when we had artillery to spot for. I'm from the Bronx, like Siegel. My dad served in World War One, like Anderson's, but at Verdun, not Chateau-Thierry. My favorite slugger? Who else? I can not wait to go back and watch Babe Ruth again!\" \"At ease, Dilworth,\" said Conrad, and turned to Sergeant Polonski. \"What now, captain?\" the sergeant asked. \"I've heard enough from these men. I know who the spy is. Sergeant, arrest that man!\" said the captain, pointing to one of the stragglers. Who did the captain point to? And why?",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What the captain already knows  \n   • A single German agent has just abandoned a captured jeep less than a mile from the farm-house H.Q.  \n   • Therefore that agent had only a few minutes to reach the farm and must be one of the four “stragglers” brought inside by Corporal Riley.  \n\n2.  Why the captain quizzes them on baseball  \n   The OSS had circulated the warning that the German commandos who had studied in the United States knew good colloquial English, but were shaky on the SMALL, CURRENT details of American life—especially sport slang and up-to-date baseball facts.  \n   Questioning every suspected spy about “his favourite big-league slugger” had become a quick field test.   \n\n3.  Examine each answer\n\n   • Siegel (Bronx) – picks “Joltin’ Joe DiMaggio.”  \n     –  DiMaggio was the Yankees’ superstar right up to the time he left for military service in 1943; any New-York Yankee fan in 1944 would still name him first.  \n     –  Nothing wrong with the answer.\n\n   • Maguire (Boston) – chooses Ted Williams.  \n     – Williams was likewise a Boston idol even though he, too, was in the Marines in 1944.  \n     –  A perfectly natural choice for a Red Sox fan.\n\n   • Anderson (Missouri) – hesitates between Enos Slaughter and Stan Musial, the two current Cardinal greats.  \n     –  Precisely what a 1944 Cards supporter would say.  \n     –  His “history-lesson” about Missouri is also basically correct: the state never officially seceded although it had a Confederate shadow government.\n\n   • Dilworth (Bronx) – “I can NOT wait to go back and watch Babe Ruth again!”  \n     –  Fatal mistake.  Babe Ruth retired in 1935, nine full seasons earlier.  No GI in 1944 would expect to see Ruth step up to the plate again.  \n     –  The name itself is familiar world-wide, so a German trying to sound American might naturally reach for it, but only someone OUT of touch with current baseball would believe Ruth was still playing.\n\n4.  Motive, opportunity, physical evidence  \n   • The man who turned the road sign had to ditch his jeep and walk straight to the farm; that is exactly what a lone infiltrator posing as a “straggler” would do.  \n   • “Dilworth” supplies the tell-tale evidence that he is not really a Bronx-born GI at all; the other three men show no comparable slip.\n\n5.  Conclusion  \n   The spy is the man calling himself Dilworth.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSiegel, Maguire, Anderson, Dilworth\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n“Dilworth”  (true identity: unknown German agent)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate in the afternoon of 16 December 1944, a German commando driving a captured American jeep sneaked behind the lines, stopped at a crossroads and turned the direction sign to mislead on-coming U.S. traffic.  \nRunning low on fuel, he abandoned the jeep, set off toward the nearest American installation—the farmhouse being used by Captain Conrad—and arrived minutes before the captain himself returned.  \nClaiming to be “Dilworth,” an artillery spotter cut off from his unit, he joined three genuine stragglers whom Corporal Riley was already sheltering in the shed.  \nWhen Captain Conrad questioned the four about baseball, the impostor reached for the most famous name he knew—Babe Ruth—betraying that his knowledge of current American sports ended with the early 1930s.  \nConrad immediately realised that only someone out of touch with 1944 America could think Babe Ruth was still a big-league slugger and ordered the man arrested.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Siegel knew Hanukkah was in progress and named DiMaggio, the obvious Yankee choice.  \n• Maguire’s seasick D-Day story matches the well-known one-day weather postponement, and Ted Williams was every Boston fan’s hero despite being in the service.  \n• Anderson’s Civil-War/WW I family background is historically sound and his choice of Musial or Slaughter is exactly what a 1944 Cardinals rooter would say.  \nNone of them made the sort of glaring cultural error that exposed “Dilworth” as an impostor.",

    "answer_options": "(a) Anderson; (b) Dilworth; (c) Maguire; (d) Siegel",
    "correct_answer": "(b) Dilworth",
    "reveal_text": "The Festival of Lights, or Hanukkah, is a Jewish holiday celebrated in December. It is traditional to light candles in the window at sundown. The Nazis persecuted Jews, and did not allow them in the German army. So a German agent would not light Hanukkah candles, or even know what Hanukkah is. So Siegel was not the spy.\nD-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France on June 6, 1944, was originally scheduled for the day before. However, bad weather forced a 24-hour postponement. Because of military secrecy, neither the enemy nor the American public, were told about the delay until after the war. The only way Maguire could have known about it was if he was there himself. If he landed in France on D-Day, then he wasn't a German spy.\nVery few Germans would know as much about American history as Anderson does. While not proof, it suggests that Anderson is American, not German. The Battle of Chateau-Thierry, where Anderson's dad served, was the first major engagement fought by Americans in France.\nSiegel, Maguire and Anderson all named baseball superstars of the 1940s. Babe Ruth, however, played his last full season in 1934, suggesting that Dilworth hadn't seen a major-league game in at least ten years.\nDilworth's remark about his father was as good as a confession. His dad might have served at Verdun during World War One, but not for the American army! The Battle of Verdun was in 1916, and America didn't enter the war until 1917. Even without any other clues, this one tells you that Dilworth is the spy.",

That's the same direction we're going, Captain,\" Johnson exclaimed. \"And headquarters is just a mile up the road. He must be in camp!\" \"I think so, Johnson. So step on it! We need to get back now.\" The sun had just set as Captain Conrad burst through the door into the front hall of the abandoned farmhouse that served as his headquarters. \"Sergeant Polonski! Did any stragglers arrive while I was gone?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Polonski, flipping through his clipboard. \"There were four: Anderson, Dilworth, Maguire, and Siegel. They're down in the shed with Corporal Riley now.\" \"Are you absolutely sure only four came in while I was gone?\" \"Absolutely, sir. I doubled up on sentries the whole time you were gone. Everyone who showed up is in the shed.\" \"Well, round up the extra sentries into a guard detail, and get down to the shed right away,\" said the captain. \"One of those men is a German spy!\" Five minutes later, Sergeant Polonski and the guards met Captain Conrad at the shed. Then they all saw something unusual. Suddenly, five candles in the shed window were lit, one by one. Five small flames twinkled in the gloom. The soldiers outside exchanged quizzical glances, but said nothing. Then Conrad and Polonski stepped inside. \"Ten-HUT!\" cried Corporal Riley as they walked in. \"At ease, corporal. You men, stay at attention,\" the captain told the stragglers. \"Who just lit those candles in the window?\" \"I did, sir,\" said Siegel, one of the stragglers. \"Why? To signal the enemy how many men were in here?\" \"Oh, no sir! They're for the festival of lights!\" \"Where are you from, Siegel? Who's your favorite big-league slugger?\" \"I'm a Yankee fan, sir, from the Bronx, you know, so that's Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Last week I was a battalion clerk, but - that was before the enemy overran us.\" \"At ease, Siegel,\" the captain said. Then he turned to Maguire, who rocked slowly from side to side, sweating and shivering. \"What's wrong with you, soldier? Nervous about something?\" \"No, sir,\" Maguire whispered hoarsely. \"I'm sick. Must be something I ate. I haven't felt this bad since D-Day. I got so seasick when they delayed the invasion, and we rode out that storm in the hold of the ship.\" \"At ease, soldier,\" said the captain. \"Sit down til you feel better.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" replied Maguire, as he slumped into a chair. \"By the way, where are you from and who's your favorite slugger?\" \"I'm from Boston, sir - the home of the bean and the cod. So Ted Williams is my guy.\" Captain Conrad turned to the third straggler. \"Who are you, soldier?\" \"Anderson, sir. I'm a rifleman and Missourian. My dad served in World War One and saw his first action at Chateau-Thierry while my great-granddad saw Lee's rebels surrender to Grant at Appomattox.\" \"Why would your great-granddad fight for the Union? Wasn't Missouri a slave state?\" \"Yes sir, it was a slave state, captain. But anti-slavery sentiment was pretty strong in some parts. So the slavers never took over the state legislature, and the state never seceded from the Union. So Missouri sent some mighty fine regiments to the Grand Old Army, sir - and some to the rebels, too.\" \"Who's your favorite big-league slugger, Anderson?\" \"Well, I'm a St. Louis Cardinals fan, captain. I never much cared for the Browns. So I've got a tough choice between Enos Slaughter and Stan Musial.\" \"At ease, Anderson,\" said the captain, and turned to the fourth straggler. \"What's your story, soldier?\" \"I'm Dilworth, sir. I was an artillery spotter - when we had artillery to spot for. I'm from the Bronx, like Siegel. My dad served in World War One, like Anderson's, but at Verdun, not Chateau-Thierry. My favorite slugger? Who else? I can not wait to go back and watch Babe Ruth again!\" \"At ease, Dilworth,\" said Conrad, and turned to Sergeant Polonski. \"What now, captain?\" the sergeant asked. \"I've heard enough from these men. I know who the spy is. Sergeant, arrest that man!\" said the captain, pointing to one of the stragglers. Who did the captain point to? And why?",
      "answer_options": "(a) Anderson; (b) Dilworth; (c) Maguire; (d) Siegel",
      "answer": "(b) Dilworth",
      "outcome": "The Festival of Lights, or Hanukkah, is a Jewish holiday celebrated in December. It is traditional to light candles in the window at sundown. The Nazis persecuted Jews, and did not allow them in the German army. So a German agent would not light Hanukkah candles, or even know what Hanukkah is. So Siegel was not the spy.\nD-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France on June 6, 1944, was originally scheduled for the day before. However, bad weather forced a 24-hour postponement. Because of military secrecy, neither the enemy nor the American public, were told about the delay until after the war. The only way Maguire could have known about it was if he was there himself. If he landed in France on D-Day, then he wasn't a German spy.\nVery few Germans would know as much about American history as Anderson does. While not proof, it suggests that Anderson is American, not German. The Battle of Chateau-Thierry, where Anderson's dad served, was the first major engagement fought by Americans in France.\nSiegel, Maguire and Anderson all named baseball superstars of the 1940s. Babe Ruth, however, played his last full season in 1934, suggesting that Dilworth hadn't seen a major-league game in at least ten years.\nDilworth's remark about his father was as good as a confession. His dad might have served at Verdun during World War One, but not for the American army! The Battle of Verdun was in 1916, and America didn't enter the war until 1917. Even without any other clues, this one tells you that Dilworth is the spy."
