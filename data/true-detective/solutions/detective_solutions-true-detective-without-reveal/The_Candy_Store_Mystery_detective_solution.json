    "full_text": "Katie Johnson and Alicia Cates were best friends. The women were genuinely fond of one another, and their friendship had an added benefit: The Cates and Johnson families lived next door to each other, and so the two mothers often teamed up when working with the children and their various church and school activities. One sunny day in early spring, the moms planned a fun outing for the five kids. Katie had two girls, Emilee and Olivia, ages nine and three, respectively. Alicia had two boys and one girl: Trevor was the oldest at age six, followed by four-year-old Justin and two-year-old Brianna. Since school was out for Emilee, Katie and Alicia promised the kids a trip to the candy store at the mall. Darby’s Confectionary was not just any candy store. It was huge, with lots of floor space divided into sections that carried just about every type of sweets in existence. It even had an “Old Time Candy” department which Katie’s husband Carl loved to frequent. In fact, Katie planned to purchase a couple of packages of Sixties-era clove flavored chewing gum for him while she, Alicia and the kids visited the store. Around mid-morning, everyone piled into the Johnson SUV and headed toward the mall and Darby’s Confectionary. The children were excited, even though Katie and Alicia had set a firm rule: No candy until after lunch. They were going to the Confectionary to purchase only, and would need to save the treats for later in the afternoon. The mothers were agile young women, very quick on their feet—they needed to be when in the candy store with the children. As soon as the pleasant smell of sweets hit their little noses, the kids quickly began to spread out to explore. Katie and Alicia weren’t worried; they knew from previous experience that this was not as much of a problem as it seemed. The store was well-lit with wide aisles, and most of the candy was either behind counters or stored high enough that young children could not reach it. Besides, they had been clear about their rules for this outing, and they trusted their little ones to be respectful. The moms took their time going to the gum counter to make Katie’s purchase for Carl. Livvie, Katie’s three-year-old, went with them. Livvie had a nasty head cold and didn’t feel well, but Katie knew that missing a trip to the Confectionary would break the little girl’s heart. Livvie had suffered from the cold for several days and her mother hoped that getting out of the house and breathing some fresh air would make her feel better and restore her appetite. Emilee had offered to walk Brianna around the store, but being a typical two-year-old, Brianna became distracted by the section of the store where the brownies and cookies were displayed. These items were baked fresh every morning and kept in a glass case with a slide door and a low key lock in the back. Emilee had been distracted herself, looking at the hard candy, imagining they way they’d melt in her mouth. Before noticing that Brianna had wandered off, she considered asking her mom to buy a few ounces of heart-shaped mints. Mr. Darby was working in the hard candy section and asked her if she would like a sample. Emilee was tempted but replied that no, she had better not, as her mother would not like it if she found out. Mr. Darby grinned and told her to her to bring her mother over to see him before leaving and he would give her a small sample to take home. Emilee saw that Brianna had wandered off, and she quickly found her a couple of aisles over, staring at the blonde brownies and chocolate chip cookies. Brianna’s plump little fingers smudged the glass as she pointed out to Emilee the delicious-looking sweets. After grabbing a few packs of Carl’s favorite clove gum and visiting with the woman staffing the Old Time Candy department for a few minutes, the women found Trevor in the licorice section. There was licorice of all flavors and colors displayed but Alicia though it odd that her son would be looking in this area, for he had recently lost a tooth when falling off his bicycle and chewing was very painful. Katie, Alicia, and Trevor then met the girls in the bakery section. Emilee told her mom about her conversation with Mr. Darby, and Katie thanked her for following the no candy until after lunch rule. The last child they rounded up was Justin. Justin was a typical four-year-old boy who had gravitated to the messiest area of the store, the soft chocolate section. The section was partially roped off, as Mr. Darby was remodeling a display on a side wall and had left a step stool, paint drop cloth and some loose pieces of wood on the floor. Mr. Darby kept candy bars and chocolate drops in this area, but they were up just high enough that a small child could not get to them. After rounding up Justin and making several purchases, the moms and kids prepared to leave. They approached Mr. Darby, who was still behind the hard candy counter. “Good, you’ve come back for your free sample,” he said to Emilee, smiling. He looked at the young mothers. “But one of my clerks tells me that somebody had a snack they forgot to pay for.” Alicia and Katie spoke with the children for a few minutes, but none of them admitted to anything. Finally, Alicia said to Mr. Darby, “I know who the guilty party is without you having to tell me!”",

List them here:\n\n<SUSPECTS>\n<names(s) for all suspects here, comma separated>\n</SUSPECTS>\n\nWho is the culprit (or culprits, if more than one) and why? I want you to distinguish between the main culprit(s) and the accomplices (if any). If there are none, write None. If possible, include first and last names, as well as any aliases. Answer in the form:\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n<name(s) here>\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n<name(s) here>\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\nNow write down your reconstruction of the events of what actually happened.\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n<event reconstruction here>\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\nFinally, explain why the other suspects are innocent.\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n<explanation here>\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First find out WHO could not have done it.\n   • Livvie (3) never left her mother’s side because she felt ill and stayed at the gum counter the whole time.  \n     – No opportunity.  \n   • Katie and Alicia were together the whole time as well; neither would steal candy in front of the other.  \n   • Emilee (9) was seen by Mr Darby himself at the hard-candy counter, turned down the free sample, and then immediately went to find Brianna.  \n     – Mr Darby therefore knows she did not take anything; if she had, he would not now be guessing.  \n   • Brianna (2) cannot open the bakery display: it has a rear sliding door that is kept locked.  \n     – She merely smudged the glass while Emilee watched her.  \n   • Trevor (6) was in the licorice section but has a very sore mouth from a newly lost tooth; chewing hurts, so it is extremely unlikely he would risk biting into anything before lunch.  \n\n2. Who DID have both opportunity and ability?\n   • Justin (4) wandered off to the soft-chocolate section, the messiest part of the store, and was the last child rounded up.  \n     – This area was “partially roped off” because Mr Darby was remodeling; a step-stool was standing there.  \n     – The chocolate bars were set just high enough that a small child “could not reach them”---unless he climbed the step-stool.  \n     – A four-year-old boy who loves getting messy would naturally try that.  \n     – Chocolate is easy to bite (unlike licorice) and melts quickly, so a clerk could see him pop it into his mouth.  \n\n3. Why could Alicia identify the culprit instantly?  \n   – She simply eliminated the impossible:  \n     • Livvie was with them, Brianna could not get into a locked case, Trevor would not chew, Emilee was under Mr Darby’s eye and clearly obeying the rule.  \n     – Only Justin had the necessary time alone plus a reachable supply of candy (thanks to the step-stool).  \n   – Therefore the thief had to be Justin; Alicia did not need the clerk to say so.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nKatie Johnson, Alicia Cates, Emilee Johnson, Olivia “Livvie” Johnson, Trevor Cates, Justin Cates, Brianna Cates\n</SUPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJustin Cates\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhile the mothers were buying clove gum, Justin slipped away to the roped-off soft-chocolate section.  \nNoticing the step-stool that Mr Darby had left, he climbed up, reached a chocolate drop or bar, unwrapped it, and ate it on the spot.  \nA store clerk, working in an adjacent aisle, saw the little boy help himself but did not know his name; she reported it to Mr Darby.  \nJustin re-joined the rest of the group just before they left, probably with a chocolate-smeared mouth and fingers.  \nWhen Mr Darby mentioned the unpaid candy, Alicia quickly reviewed where each child had been and realised only her four-year-old son could have done it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Katie Johnson & Alicia Cates – were together the whole time, busy selecting gum and rounding up children; always in one another’s sight.  \n• Emilee Johnson – was personally observed by Mr Darby refusing even a free sample; she obeys the “no candy” rule.  \n• Olivia “Livvie” Johnson – never left her mother’s side because of her head cold; no opportunity.  \n• Brianna Cates – could only stare through the locked bakery glass; she is too small to unlock or reach inside the case.  \n• Trevor Cates – sore mouth from a lost tooth; unlikely to chew anything, and a clerk would have noticed had he tried.  \nTherefore they could not have been the ones who snacked without paying, leaving Justin as the lone viable culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
