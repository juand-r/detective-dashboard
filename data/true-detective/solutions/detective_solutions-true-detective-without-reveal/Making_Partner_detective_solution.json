    "full_text": "“This is boring,” Suzie Shaw said to her boyfriend. Next to her in the front seat of his car, Dan Cartman rolled his eyes. “I told you a million times that this wouldn’t be a date, and that stakeouts aren’t as cool as the cop shows make them seem. But remember, you insisted on coming along anyway.” Suzie sighed. “I know, I know.” She smiled and playfully punched his arm. “But I couldn’t let you sit out here on the mean streets of Dullsville, Florida by yourself.” Dan and Suzie were parked at the side of the road in a nondescript suburban neighborhood on a warm summer’s night. At 7:00 p.m., all was quiet, save for the occasional jogger, baby walker or dog walker. Suzie snuggled up to him. “I know a way we could pass the time.” “This isn’t about passing the time,” Dan said. “I can’t let you distract me. This is the first case my dad’s let me handle on my own. I can’t blow it.” “I’m just teasing.” Suzie settled back into her own seat. “So tell me again why the police haven’t caught this house robber.” “They claim they don’t have any leads. Our client, Mrs. Krantz -- the first victim, a widow who had thousands of dollars worth of jewelry stolen -- insists it’s a guy named Mike Creighton who lives in the neighborhood, and she’s hired us to prove it. Mrs. Krantz says she’s kept her eye on him ever since he moved in.” “Maybe she’s just lonely.” “Maybe, but ... uh ...” A pretty blonde girl jogged toward the car, distracting Dan. And much to Suzie’s annoyance, Dan jumped out to talk to the jogger. Suzie’s window was open, so she eavesdropped on their conversation. “Excuse me,” Dan said. The jogger stopped and gave him a flirtatious smile. “Hi,” she said. “I’m Jill. Are you stalking me or just trying to get my phone number?” “What? Stalking? I, uh--” “I’ve seen you sitting in your car every night this week ...” “Oh, that, well, I’m a private detective and--” Jill smiled. “Oh, how exciting! Are you on a stakeout?” Dan grinned ear to ear, loving the attention. “Yes, I’m here--” “With his girlfriend,” Suzie said loudly as she exited the car and joined them. Jill gave Suzie a dismissive glance. “I hear there’s been a series of robberies in the neighborhood,” she said to Dan. She touched his muscular arm briefly. “But I feel much safer now that you’re on the case.” Dan cleared his throat, uncomfortable under Suzie’s piercing stare. “Aren’t you worried that your home will be robbed while you’re out jogging?” “No, I have a roommate.” “Have you seen anything suspicious while jogging?” “No, the only thing I noticed-- ” Jill smirked at Suzie, “was you watching me.” “I, uh, had to make sure you weren’t the robber,” Dan said. “Look at me,” she said. Jill raised her arms up to focus Dan’s attention on her small, formfitting clothes and her tan, bare skin. “Don’t even think about asking him to do a strip search,” Suzie said. Jill gave her that annoying smirk again. “Not tonight.” She turned back to Dan, “But maybe next time. See you around, detective man.” She jogged away. Dan watched her go and was rewarded with a not-so-playful punch in the arm from Suzie. “Ow! I had to observe her,” he said. “She could have done something suspicious.” “Uh-huh.” “Seriously. There’s definitely a connection between the walkers and joggers and the crimes. Everyone who’s been hit was out of their house for a short period of time and never went more than a few blocks away on foot.” “Does Mrs. Krantz jog?” Suzie asked. “No, she walks her poodle, and ... there she is!” Suzie turned in the direction Dan pointed. Mrs. Krantz spotted them, too, and approached rapidly. “Any leads, young man?” she asked. “Nothing yet,” Dan said, “but I am, er, watching, a few people other than Creighton.” He nodded his head at Suzie. “This is my girlfriend, Suzie.” “Hi,” said Suzie. “If you don’t mind my asking, why are you so sure this Creighton guy is the robber?” “He’s new to the neighborhood,” Mrs. Krantz said, “and he’s been out walking his dog every time a house was robbed.” “So have you ...” “Exactly! I can testify that he’s been in the vicinity of every crime. Speaking of which, I’ve got to keep moving. One of us has to catch him in the act!” And with that, Mrs. Krantz continued on her way. “Was she implying that she thinks I can’t catch the robber?” Dan asked as he and Suzie got back into the car. “No, I’m sure she wasn’t,” Suzie said reassuringly. “But her reasoning for fingering Creighton sounds pretty flimsy to me.” “Yeah, but she still convinced a cop to question Creighton after the last robbery. Under her watchful eye, the cop practically strip-searched the poor guy on the sidewalk, but all he had on him was a bag of doggy doo-doo.” Dan chuckled. “Mrs. Krantz even had the cop check the dog’s mouth.” “So why are we here again?” “Because Mrs. Krantz paid my father,” Dan said. “And if you want me to be able to afford an engagement ring for you, my father has to make me a full partner in Cartman Investigations, not just a glorified errand boy. So you better hope we catch the real thief tonight.” Suzie raised her arm and admired the sparkly gold bracelet she wore. “You didn’t have any problem affording my beautiful birthday present,” she said. “I got that from a pawn shop, if you must know,” Dan said. Suzie felt bad for embarrassing Dan, but didn’t know what to say. After an awkward silence, Dan said, “Can you keep an eye on things? I’m going to run up the street to the gas station to use their restroom.” “Okay, hurry back,” Suzie said. Nothing happened while Dan was gone, and Suzie’s boredom returned. Then, just as Dan came back into sight, a woman with a double baby stroller exited a stucco house. Dan spoke to her briefly, smiled at her twin babies, and then came back to the car. “That’s Wanda. She’s definitely not the robber,” Dan said. “Not with those two babies demanding her constant attention.” “You sure there’ll even be another robbery tonight?” Suzie asked. “There’s been one every Wednesday since they began, despite the added police patrols of the neighborhood.” A little while later, Dan suddenly pointed out the open window at a man walking toward them on the sidewalk. “Hey, that’s him!” Suzie grabbed his hand and pulled it back in. “Great P.I. you’ll make, pointing at the suspects. Real covert.” “I--” “Shut up and kiss me, silly. Or do you want him to think we’ve been sitting here waiting for him?” Dan didn’t argue. As they kissed, they still watched Creighton walk by with his dog’s leash in one hand and a stinky plastic bag in the other. Once the man was a few houses away, Dan broke off the embrace. “C’mon,” he said as he opened his door, “let’s go for a romantic walk.” They didn’t follow Creighton for long before he ducked behind some tall bushes at the side of the stucco house. “There you go,” Suzie said, “he’s going to rob that house.” Dan pointed at the ground through a gap in the bushes, where the dog was crouched, apparently doing its business. “Just giving his dog some privacy,” he said. “We’re going to have to circle the block or else he’ll notice us.” They circled the block, and as they returned to the stucco house, they saw Mike Creighton heading away from them, and they also saw Mrs. Krantz walking toward them from farther up the street. At the same time, Wanda came from across the street in front of them and went back into her house. A moment later, there came a scream from inside. Dan and Suzie hurried over. Wanda and her babies were fine, but she was on the verge of tears. “I’ve been robbed,” she said. “Someone stole my wedding ring!” “Don’t worry,” Suzie said, “I know who took it.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Look for a pattern.  \n   • Every burglary happens on Wednesday evening while the home-owner is only a few minutes away on foot.  \n   • The thief therefore must be someone who is also routinely out on the street, can spot people leaving, slip inside for a minute or two, and then keep walking without attracting notice.\n\n2. Decide who on the street fits that description.  \n   • Jill the jogger – out every night, but she carries no bag or bulky clothing in which to hide loot.  \n   • Mrs. Krantz – dog walker, but she was the very first “victim”; if she were the thief she would have had to stage a burglary of her own home first, which is an unnecessary complication.  \n   • Mike Creighton – dog walker, new in the neighborhood, always present when a house is hit, and (crucially) always carries an opaque, smelly plastic bag of “doggy doo.”  \n   • Wanda – today’s victim, obviously not today’s thief.  \n   • Dan & Suzie – observers, no motive.\n\n3. Note the built-in hiding place.  \n   • Police once “practically strip-searched” Creighton but did not thoroughly inspect the stinking bag of dog waste.  \n   • Jewelry or other small valuables dropped into that bag would be almost guaranteed not to be examined.\n\n4. Analyse tonight’s time line.  \n   • Suzie & Dan see Creighton let his dog duck behind the shrubbery of Wanda’s stucco house while Wanda is still out with the twins.  \n   • They walk around the block for only a couple of minutes.  \n   • On their return they see:  \n        – Creighton already walking away, still holding the leash and the plastic bag.  \n        – Mrs. Krantz approaching from the far end of the street, too far away to have just been inside Wanda’s house.  \n        – Wanda crossing the street and re-entering her house.  \n   • Seconds later Wanda screams that her wedding ring is gone.  \n   • Therefore the burglary had to occur in the tiny window between Wanda’s departure and her return—exactly the period when Creighton and his dog were hidden behind the shrubbery.\n\n5. Put it together.  \n   • Motive: ordinary theft; he is new, no ties, valuable jewelry easy to pawn.  \n   • Opportunity: alone behind the bushes of an empty house.  \n   • Means & concealment: slips inside through an unlocked door or window, grabs small valuables, drops them into the dog-waste bag.  The smell ensures no one looks inside should he be stopped.  \n   • Prior incidents fit the same method; that is why he has been “in the vicinity” of every crime yet nothing incriminating is ever found on him.\n\nConclusion: Mike Creighton is the only person who could have committed tonight’s crime and the only one whose routine provides the perfect hiding place for stolen jewelry.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMike Creighton, Jill (the jogger), Mrs. Krantz, Wanda, Dan Cartman, Suzie Shaw\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMike Creighton\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nCreighton times his evening dog walks to coincide with neighbors taking short strolls or jogs.  \nWhen he sees someone leave, he lets the dog “do its business” near the target house, quickly slips inside through an unlocked door or window, grabs small, high-value items and drops them into the plastic bag already containing dog droppings.  \nBecause very few people – police included – want to poke through a bag of excrement, he can be searched on the sidewalk and still appear clean.  \nTonight he watched Wanda push the double stroller away.  He led his dog behind the shrubbery of her stucco house, jimmied the door, took the wedding ring from a convenient dish or dresser, buried it in the poop bag, and walked off.  \nDan and Suzie arrived back a minute later, saw him leaving, and seconds after that Wanda discovered the loss.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Jill: No bag, pack or bulky clothing to hide stolen objects; nowhere near the house at the critical moment.  \n• Mrs. Krantz: Was the first reported victim and was still coming down the street when Wanda re-entered; she could not have broken in and returned that quickly.  \n• Wanda: She was pushing two babies across the street at the time her own house was entered.  \n• Dan & Suzie: Together and in plain sight the whole evening; their actions are accounted for and they had no motive.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "As they waited for the police to arrive, Dan took Suzie aside and said, “How do you know?”\n“Don’t worry, I’ll let you take full credit.”\n“So you don’t think I did it?”\n“Why?” Suzie asked. She jiggled the bracelet he’d given her. “Because of this? No. Besides, you were with me the whole time Wanda was out of her house.”\n“I hope you’re not planning on telling the police Jill did it, just because you’re jealous.”\n“She should be arrested for indecent exposure,” Suzie said. “But for that same reason, I know she’s innocent of this crime because she had nowhere to hide the stolen jewelry.”\n“And certainly you don’t think Mrs. Krantz is the thief?” Dan asked.\n“Faking her own robbery and then hiring a private detective would be a clever way to divert suspicion from herself,” Suzie said, “but she was coming toward the house from a distance shortly after the crime took place. She’s a fast walker, but not that fast.”\n“So obviously you think it’s Creighton,” Dan said, “but we have no proof.”\nAnd a minute later, Mike Creighton himself said the same thing to the police officer -- who’d already been patrolling the neighborhood and came upon Mrs. Krantz attempting to make a citizen’s arrest on Creighton near the crime scene.\nSuzie whispered in Dan’s ear, and he relayed the message to the officer: “Make him empty out his bag.”\n“I already checked,” the officer said. “It’s full of dog--”\n“Did you look under ...”\n“No.”\nThe cop instructed Creighton to empty the bag. And there, sealed in a sandwich bag, was Wanda’s diamond ring.\nSuzie whispered in Dan’s ear again: “Now that you’ve solved your first case, I expect my ring to be just a big as that one.”\nWhile the officer arrested Creighton, Dan smiled in wonder at his girlfriend. “How did you know where to look?” he asked.\n“Didn’t you get a whiff of what was in his plastic bag as he walked by the car?”\n“Yeah, so?”\nSuzie grinned. “Since your prime suspect’s bag was already full of doggy doo-doo when he walked behind the bushes next to Wanda’s house, I realized that he, not his dog, wanted to add something to it.”",

      "mystery_text": "“This is boring,” Suzie Shaw said to her boyfriend. Next to her in the front seat of his car, Dan Cartman rolled his eyes. “I told you a million times that this wouldn’t be a date, and that stakeouts aren’t as cool as the cop shows make them seem. But remember, you insisted on coming along anyway.” Suzie sighed. “I know, I know.” She smiled and playfully punched his arm. “But I couldn’t let you sit out here on the mean streets of Dullsville, Florida by yourself.” Dan and Suzie were parked at the side of the road in a nondescript suburban neighborhood on a warm summer’s night. At 7:00 p.m., all was quiet, save for the occasional jogger, baby walker or dog walker. Suzie snuggled up to him. “I know a way we could pass the time.” “This isn’t about passing the time,” Dan said. “I can’t let you distract me. This is the first case my dad’s let me handle on my own. I can’t blow it.” “I’m just teasing.” Suzie settled back into her own seat. “So tell me again why the police haven’t caught this house robber.” “They claim they don’t have any leads. Our client, Mrs. Krantz -- the first victim, a widow who had thousands of dollars worth of jewelry stolen -- insists it’s a guy named Mike Creighton who lives in the neighborhood, and she’s hired us to prove it. Mrs. Krantz says she’s kept her eye on him ever since he moved in.” “Maybe she’s just lonely.” “Maybe, but ... uh ...” A pretty blonde girl jogged toward the car, distracting Dan. And much to Suzie’s annoyance, Dan jumped out to talk to the jogger. Suzie’s window was open, so she eavesdropped on their conversation. “Excuse me,” Dan said. The jogger stopped and gave him a flirtatious smile. “Hi,” she said. “I’m Jill. Are you stalking me or just trying to get my phone number?” “What? Stalking? I, uh--” “I’ve seen you sitting in your car every night this week ...” “Oh, that, well, I’m a private detective and--” Jill smiled. “Oh, how exciting! Are you on a stakeout?” Dan grinned ear to ear, loving the attention. “Yes, I’m here--” “With his girlfriend,” Suzie said loudly as she exited the car and joined them. Jill gave Suzie a dismissive glance. “I hear there’s been a series of robberies in the neighborhood,” she said to Dan. She touched his muscular arm briefly. “But I feel much safer now that you’re on the case.” Dan cleared his throat, uncomfortable under Suzie’s piercing stare. “Aren’t you worried that your home will be robbed while you’re out jogging?” “No, I have a roommate.” “Have you seen anything suspicious while jogging?” “No, the only thing I noticed-- ” Jill smirked at Suzie, “was you watching me.” “I, uh, had to make sure you weren’t the robber,” Dan said. “Look at me,” she said. Jill raised her arms up to focus Dan’s attention on her small, formfitting clothes and her tan, bare skin. “Don’t even think about asking him to do a strip search,” Suzie said. Jill gave her that annoying smirk again. “Not tonight.” She turned back to Dan, “But maybe next time. See you around, detective man.” She jogged away. Dan watched her go and was rewarded with a not-so-playful punch in the arm from Suzie. “Ow! I had to observe her,” he said. “She could have done something suspicious.” “Uh-huh.” “Seriously. There’s definitely a connection between the walkers and joggers and the crimes. Everyone who’s been hit was out of their house for a short period of time and never went more than a few blocks away on foot.” “Does Mrs. Krantz jog?” Suzie asked. “No, she walks her poodle, and ... there she is!” Suzie turned in the direction Dan pointed. Mrs. Krantz spotted them, too, and approached rapidly. “Any leads, young man?” she asked. “Nothing yet,” Dan said, “but I am, er, watching, a few people other than Creighton.” He nodded his head at Suzie. “This is my girlfriend, Suzie.” “Hi,” said Suzie. “If you don’t mind my asking, why are you so sure this Creighton guy is the robber?” “He’s new to the neighborhood,” Mrs. Krantz said, “and he’s been out walking his dog every time a house was robbed.” “So have you ...” “Exactly! I can testify that he’s been in the vicinity of every crime. Speaking of which, I’ve got to keep moving. One of us has to catch him in the act!” And with that, Mrs. Krantz continued on her way. “Was she implying that she thinks I can’t catch the robber?” Dan asked as he and Suzie got back into the car. “No, I’m sure she wasn’t,” Suzie said reassuringly. “But her reasoning for fingering Creighton sounds pretty flimsy to me.” “Yeah, but she still convinced a cop to question Creighton after the last robbery. Under her watchful eye, the cop practically strip-searched the poor guy on the sidewalk, but all he had on him was a bag of doggy doo-doo.” Dan chuckled. “Mrs. Krantz even had the cop check the dog’s mouth.” “So why are we here again?” “Because Mrs. Krantz paid my father,” Dan said. “And if you want me to be able to afford an engagement ring for you, my father has to make me a full partner in Cartman Investigations, not just a glorified errand boy. So you better hope we catch the real thief tonight.” Suzie raised her arm and admired the sparkly gold bracelet she wore. “You didn’t have any problem affording my beautiful birthday present,” she said. “I got that from a pawn shop, if you must know,” Dan said. Suzie felt bad for embarrassing Dan, but didn’t know what to say. After an awkward silence, Dan said, “Can you keep an eye on things? I’m going to run up the street to the gas station to use their restroom.” “Okay, hurry back,” Suzie said. Nothing happened while Dan was gone, and Suzie’s boredom returned. Then, just as Dan came back into sight, a woman with a double baby stroller exited a stucco house. Dan spoke to her briefly, smiled at her twin babies, and then came back to the car. “That’s Wanda. She’s definitely not the robber,” Dan said. “Not with those two babies demanding her constant attention.” “You sure there’ll even be another robbery tonight?” Suzie asked. “There’s been one every Wednesday since they began, despite the added police patrols of the neighborhood.” A little while later, Dan suddenly pointed out the open window at a man walking toward them on the sidewalk. “Hey, that’s him!” Suzie grabbed his hand and pulled it back in. “Great P.I. you’ll make, pointing at the suspects. Real covert.” “I--” “Shut up and kiss me, silly. Or do you want him to think we’ve been sitting here waiting for him?” Dan didn’t argue. As they kissed, they still watched Creighton walk by with his dog’s leash in one hand and a stinky plastic bag in the other. Once the man was a few houses away, Dan broke off the embrace. “C’mon,” he said as he opened his door, “let’s go for a romantic walk.” They didn’t follow Creighton for long before he ducked behind some tall bushes at the side of the stucco house. “There you go,” Suzie said, “he’s going to rob that house.” Dan pointed at the ground through a gap in the bushes, where the dog was crouched, apparently doing its business. “Just giving his dog some privacy,” he said. “We’re going to have to circle the block or else he’ll notice us.” They circled the block, and as they returned to the stucco house, they saw Mike Creighton heading away from them, and they also saw Mrs. Krantz walking toward them from farther up the street. At the same time, Wanda came from across the street in front of them and went back into her house. A moment later, there came a scream from inside. Dan and Suzie hurried over. Wanda and her babies were fine, but she was on the verge of tears. “I’ve been robbed,” she said. “Someone stole my wedding ring!” “Don’t worry,” Suzie said, “I know who took it.”",
