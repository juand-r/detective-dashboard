    "full_text": "Steve Clairborne stretched his long arms up over his head and yawned. Another morning of tedious audit work had at last gone by the wayside. “How ‘bout lunch, guys?” the pencil-thin, red-topped young man asked. As senior accountant in charge of the audit staff, he set the pace. “Let’s do it!” Shel Jonas yelped, slamming his pencil down onto his desk. The rotund first-year staff assistant liked his food. Tro Nguyen and Steve laughed. Anything to break the tension of the grueling ten-hour workdays that were the norm for public accounting staffs at their clients’ businesses during the fiscal year-end ‘busy season’. Cynthia Kirwan, a born accountant in both appearance and attitude, didn’t share in the laughter. Tro carefully placed the gold-trimmed mechanical pencil his parents had given him as a university graduation present down on his desk. “You can lock up the room, can’t you, Steve?” he asked. “Don’t sweat it, Tro,” Steve replied. “I got a key from Benjamin a couple of hours ago, so you won’t have to take your pencil out to lunch with you.” “Yeah, but I’ve kind of had my eye on that expensive writing instrument,” Shel winked. “I doubt it,” Tro retorted, smiling at his colleague. The size-large auditor laughed. Clumsy and heavy-handed, he was still an ace when it came to his accounting and auditing work. “Yeah,” he admitted, “those mechanical jobbies are way too delicate for me – I keep breaking the lead. Just give me a fistful of #4’s and a good sharpener and a big eraser and I’m ready to tick and bop the books ‘til the end of busy season.” “Graphite smears,” Cynthia sniffed, “and gets on my fingers; that’s why I always use my mini-computer to take notes or a ballpoint pen to make notations.” “Fascinating,” Shel teased. “Okay everybody,” Steve said, “let’s get out of this walk-in closet and get some lunch.” Benjamin Trodger, the controller at the company Steve and his staff were auditing, had allowed the auditors to use the company mail/supply room as their base of operations. It was a small, narrow room, and the five desks brought in for Steve’s team had to be lined up one after the other single file-style, like a school classroom row. Tro’s desk was the one closest the door, Steve’s the furthest one back. It was a tight fit, and there wasn’t much room between and on either of the side of the desks. But at least the auditors had ready access to the company accounting staff housed in the one-storey office building. “Is Dan still grilling Benjamin about those over 90 days receivables?” Steve asked, after everyone had arisen and moved towards the door. “Or vise versa,” Tro cracked from the doorway. Dan Skinner, a wry, wiry guy with unkempt brown hair, was the other student on the staff working under Steve’s direction. He’d been given the assignment of examining the client company’s revenue and accounts receivable systems and reported results for the year. As company controller, Benjamin Trodger bore the brunt of the questioning from the auditors. But the sour, middle-aged man liked to give as good as he got, constantly asking his inquisitors: What’s the point of that question? Why do you need that, anyway? When are you going to finish the audit and leave? Steve followed Tro, Shel and Cynthia out the door. Then Tro peeked his head back into the room, looking at his mechanical pencil lying on his desk. Steve moved the young man aside and locked the door. “See,” he said, holding up the key, “all secure.” They walked along the outer edge of the cubicle farm that was home to most of the company’s accounting staff and found Dan flipping through a delinquent accounts ledger he’d propped up on top of a filing cabinet. “Lunch?” he said, looking hopefully at the group. “Lunch!” Shel responded, slapping the guy on the back. “What happened to your Q&A session with Benjamin?” Steve asked. Dan grunted. “Mr. Seldon happened. He called Benjamin into his office for a ‘lunch conference’ just as I was getting going with the guy. Benjamin grabbed up a brown bag and ran out of his own office so fast I almost got a windburn.” Mr. Seldon was the company president. He ran the steelmaking operation with an iron fist. Dan made a quick note on a piece of green 7-column paper, and the lead in his mechanical pencil snapped. “Cheap piece of junk,” he growled, pumping the end of the pencil with his thumb to get some more lead out the tip. But the lead jammed inside of the pencil, rendering it useless until it could be disassembled and fixed. “Let’s go,” Dan said, shrugging. He folded the paper and stuck it in his pants pocket, then clipped the pencil to his shirt pocket. The auditors walked down an office-lined hallway towards the rear doors of the building which opened out onto the company parking lot. They all caught a brief glimpse of Benjamin Trodger inside Mr. Seldon’s office. The controller was perched on a chair next to the company president’s desk, a cheese sandwich and apple laid out in front of him. It sounded like Mr. Seldon was giving the accounting man a rather rough interpretation of what he saw in the company’s most recent monthly revenue and expense report. The controller cast a sour glance at the auditors as they trooped by. Shel inhaled a medium meat lover’s pizza for lunch, while Tro, Steve and Dan downed cheeseburgers. Cynthia picked over a mandarin orange salad, which she’d almost insisted on showing the cook at the local restaurant how to prepare. With their stomachs topped up and their sixty minutes of budgeted lunch time over, the auditors headed back to their client’s building down the street. They walked past the president’s office again and saw that Benjamin was still in conference with Mr. Seldon. The controller was perched in exactly the same position as before, the only change being that his sandwich and apple were now gone. “They’ve been at it for over an hour non-stop,” Mary Thomason, Mr. Seldon’s secretary, whispered to Steve, shaking her head. “Here, you open up the audit room, Dan,” Steve said, once they were back on the outskirts of the accounting cubicle farm out front. “I’ve got to go to the bathroom.” He tossed the key to the young man at the head of the column of auditors. Dan caught the key and briskly strode on to the audit room door, opened it up and entered the narrow, cramped room, followed shortly thereafter by Tro, Cynthia and Shel. “My pencil’s gone!” Tro cried, loud enough for Steve to hear just as he was rounding a corner for the bathroom. He ran back to the audit room, closing the door behind him so that the client staff didn’t hear any more. “You sure?” he asked Tro. “Yes! It was lying right on my desk at the front when we left. You saw it. Now it’s gone!” “Someone must’ve swiped it while we were out to lunch,” Shel said. “You sure you have the only key to this room, Steve?” Steve ruefully rubbed his chin. “I said I had a key. Not the only one. Benjamin has another.” Tro’s eyebrows shot up. “You think-” “Yes, I think I know exactly who took your mechanical pencil,” Steve responded.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Who had a reason to want Tro’s gold-trimmed mechanical pencil?\n    •  Shel Jonas – joked about it but also admitted he can’t use delicate mechanical pencils.  Motive weak.\n    •  Cynthia Kirwan – disdains pencils and prefers a computer or pen.  Motive none.\n    •  Steve Clairborne – already has a key and authority; no sign he needs a pencil.\n    •  Benjamin Trodger – owns another key, but has no known interest in the pencil.\n    •  Dan Skinner – his own mechanical pencil jammed and he called it a “cheap piece of junk.”  He suddenly needed a new pencil and admired Tro’s.\n\n2.  Who could get into the locked audit room?\n    •  Only two keys exist: one with Steve, one with Benjamin.\n    •  At lunch Steve carried his key out of the building; Benjamin carried the other key.\n    •  The audit room was *locked* with Tro’s pencil still visible.  \n    •  During the entire lunch period Benjamin was seen inside the president’s office both when the auditors left and when they returned.  Mr. Seldon’s secretary confirmed the interview had been “non-stop for over an hour,” giving Benjamin a solid alibi.\n    •  Therefore nobody entered the audit room while the group was away.\n\n3.  When could the theft have taken place?\n    •  Not before lunch – the pencil was on the desk when Steve locked the door and everyone saw it.\n    •  Not during lunch – nobody with a key was free except Steve, who was with the team; Benjamin was in conference.\n    •  That leaves only the moment of *re-entry*.\n\n4.  Who was alone in the room, even for a moment, at re-entry?\n    •  Steve tossed his key to Dan and told him to open up.\n    •  Dan reached the door first, unlocked it, and stepped inside ahead of the others.\n    •  Tro, directly behind, discovered the pencil missing only seconds later.\n\n5.  Logical deduction\n    •  The room could not have been opened until Dan used Steve’s key.\n    •  The pencil disappeared between Dan’s unlocking the door and Tro’s next step into the room—a span of only a couple of seconds when Dan was the sole person inside.\n    •  Dan had the strongest motive (his own jammed pencil) and the exclusive opportunity.  \n    •  Hence Steve could state immediately, “Yes, I think I know exactly who took your mechanical pencil.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSteve Clairborne, Shel Jonas, Cynthia Kirwan, Dan Skinner, Benjamin Trodger, Mary Thomason, Mr. Seldon\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nDan Skinner\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Late morning:  Tro leaves his expensive graduation-gift mechanical pencil on his front desk.  \n•  Noon:  Steve locks the audit room with Tro’s pencil still in plain sight.  He and the other four auditors go to lunch.  \n•  During lunch Dan’s own mechanical pencil breaks; he curses the “cheap piece of junk” and mentally notes Tro’s better pencil.  \n•  The only two keys to the audit room are with Steve (at lunch with the group) and Benjamin (trapped in the president’s office).  Therefore the room stays undisturbed.  \n•  After lunch Steve tosses his key to Dan so Dan can open the audit room while Steve detours to the restroom.  \n•  Dan reaches the door first, unlocks it, slips inside alone, takes Tro’s gold-trimmed pencil off the nearest desk, and pockets it—only a second or two before Tro follows him in.  \n•  Tro immediately notices the pencil’s absence.  Steve re-enters, realises the room was inaccessible until Dan unlocked it, recalls Dan’s expressed need for a new pencil, and instantly deduces that Dan is the thief.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Steve Clairborne – Held one key but was never alone in the room after locking it, and he gave the key away only moments before the discovery.  He also had no motive.\n•  Shel Jonas – Joked about the pencil but admits mechanical pencils are useless to him; moreover he was never in the room alone.\n•  Cynthia Kirwan – Dislikes pencils entirely and stayed with the group the whole time.\n•  Benjamin Trodger – Possesses the second key but had an iron-clad alibi: multiple witnesses saw him in the president’s office during the entire lunch period.\n•  Mary Thomason & Mr. Seldon – No known motive, no key, and never approached the audit room.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

But the sour, middle-aged man liked to give as good as he got, constantly asking his inquisitors: What’s the point of that question? Why do you need that, anyway? When are you going to finish the audit and leave? Steve followed Tro, Shel and Cynthia out the door. Then Tro peeked his head back into the room, looking at his mechanical pencil lying on his desk. Steve moved the young man aside and locked the door. “See,” he said, holding up the key, “all secure.” They walked along the outer edge of the cubicle farm that was home to most of the company’s accounting staff and found Dan flipping through a delinquent accounts ledger he’d propped up on top of a filing cabinet. “Lunch?” he said, looking hopefully at the group. “Lunch!” Shel responded, slapping the guy on the back. “What happened to your Q&A session with Benjamin?” Steve asked. Dan grunted. “Mr. Seldon happened. He called Benjamin into his office for a ‘lunch conference’ just as I was getting going with the guy. Benjamin grabbed up a brown bag and ran out of his own office so fast I almost got a windburn.” Mr. Seldon was the company president. He ran the steelmaking operation with an iron fist. Dan made a quick note on a piece of green 7-column paper, and the lead in his mechanical pencil snapped. “Cheap piece of junk,” he growled, pumping the end of the pencil with his thumb to get some more lead out the tip. But the lead jammed inside of the pencil, rendering it useless until it could be disassembled and fixed. “Let’s go,” Dan said, shrugging. He folded the paper and stuck it in his pants pocket, then clipped the pencil to his shirt pocket. The auditors walked down an office-lined hallway towards the rear doors of the building which opened out onto the company parking lot. They all caught a brief glimpse of Benjamin Trodger inside Mr. Seldon’s office. The controller was perched on a chair next to the company president’s desk, a cheese sandwich and apple laid out in front of him. It sounded like Mr. Seldon was giving the accounting man a rather rough interpretation of what he saw in the company’s most recent monthly revenue and expense report. The controller cast a sour glance at the auditors as they trooped by. Shel inhaled a medium meat lover’s pizza for lunch, while Tro, Steve and Dan downed cheeseburgers. Cynthia picked over a mandarin orange salad, which she’d almost insisted on showing the cook at the local restaurant how to prepare. With their stomachs topped up and their sixty minutes of budgeted lunch time over, the auditors headed back to their client’s building down the street. They walked past the president’s office again and saw that Benjamin was still in conference with Mr. Seldon. The controller was perched in exactly the same position as before, the only change being that his sandwich and apple were now gone. “They’ve been at it for over an hour non-stop,” Mary Thomason, Mr. Seldon’s secretary, whispered to Steve, shaking her head. “Here, you open up the audit room, Dan,” Steve said, once they were back on the outskirts of the accounting cubicle farm out front. “I’ve got to go to the bathroom.” He tossed the key to the young man at the head of the column of auditors. Dan caught the key and briskly strode on to the audit room door, opened it up and entered the narrow, cramped room, followed shortly thereafter by Tro, Cynthia and Shel. “My pencil’s gone!” Tro cried, loud enough for Steve to hear just as he was rounding a corner for the bathroom. He ran back to the audit room, closing the door behind him so that the client staff didn’t hear any more. “You sure?” he asked Tro. “Yes! It was lying right on my desk at the front when we left. You saw it. Now it’s gone!” “Someone must’ve swiped it while we were out to lunch,” Shel said. “You sure you have the only key to this room, Steve?” Steve ruefully rubbed his chin. “I said I had a key. Not the only one. Benjamin has another.” Tro’s eyebrows shot up. “You think-” “Yes, I think I know exactly who took your mechanical pencil,” Steve responded.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Benjamin Trodger; (b) Cynthia Kirwan; (c) Dan Skinner; (d) Shel Jonas",
      "answer": "(c) Dan Skinner",
      "outcome": "Dan Skinner took Tro Nguyen’s mechanical pencil. He was the first one back into the audit room after lunch and simply picked the pencil up off Tro’s desk at the head of the row while his colleagues filed in behind him, unable to see what he was doing in the narrow room.\nSince the pencil was clearly on Tro’s desk when the auditors left for lunch and locked the door to their room, the only other person who could’ve taken it was the company controller, Benjamin Trodger, because he had another key to the room. But he was tied up with Mr. Seldon, the company president, the entire time that the auditors were gone – as they witnessed on their way out of and back into the building, and as Mary Thomason, Mr. Seldon’s secretary, verbally confirmed."
