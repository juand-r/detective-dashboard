    "full_text": "Ed and Ellen McAnn lived in a semi-rural area. There were rows of houses on both sides of the street but, once you left the small neighborhood they had lived in for almost ten years, you had to travel over a mile to get to the next populated suburb. Ed and Ellen liked the semi–privacy of being out, but not too far out, from the edge of the town. They never knew what to expect on Halloween. Some years, they had numerous costumed children come to their door, happily shouting to them, “Trick or Treat! In other years there was only a handful. Ed, a detective with the City Police Department, never could figure out why this was the way it was. But, on this night, he didn’t care. Ellen had agreed to answer the door and pass out treats to the many or few who would visit their home. He had a favorite movie to watch on television. The evening was crystal clear and beautiful. The moon was shining bright above their home, which sat on the north side of a street which ran east and west. In their neighborhood where there were few trees, there was more than ample lighting for children walking over lawns and across public streets. Ed and Ellen’s daughter Crystal brought their grandsons over just after dark. She didn’t see Crystal pull her car into the driveway, as it sat to the extreme west of the property and out of view of the front door. They were the first trick or treat customers and Ellen was not only surprised but delighted. This year, she was handing out starlight mints. She knew this wasn’t much but there had been the death of her aged uncle last week and there had been little time to shop and prepare for Halloween. She felt badly but there was nothing she could do about it. Ellen soon realized this would probably be a year of few children coming to the door. It was almost an hour later before the first one arrived at the front door and, over the course of the next couple of hours, there would be only four more. She turned off the porch light and closed the door just after 9:00 p.m. She and Ed thought no more about Trick or Treat night until the next morning. As Ed opened the garage door to leave for work, he noticed something propped up on the driveway, close to the door and blocking his exit. It was a small model tombstone, which bore the inscription: Few treats in this house, I fear; Tricks to all who live here! Beside the tombstone, there were a couple of broken eggs that created a small but inconvenient mess to clean up. The garage doors sat several feet back from the front of the house and anyone wishing to pull a prank by the door would do so unnoticed. Ed remembered his wife’s concern over the lack of goodies to pass out. It seems one child resented the modest starlight mint treat and wished for more. After assisting Ellen with the cleanup, he told her they would discuss it after he returned from work. That night, Ed and Ellen relaxed after dinner. He said, “Tell me about last night.” Ellen answered, “We only had five kids come to the door. I’d like to know which one pulled the “trick” on us. I recognized all of them and would like to call the parents.” Ed said, “Keep talking.” “Well, the first child, dressed as a witch, hurriedly appeared from the direction of the Smiths, our neighbors to the east and left going towards our neighbors to the west. After listening for the traditional “Trick or Treat,” I dropped a mint into the witch’s brew pot and the child skipped away. I was a little concerned for the witch because her costume was so baggy and loose fitting that I feared she would trip and hurt herself.” “Next came the lion. He was very small and with his father. After thanking me I saw them head toward the Smith home. They didn’t seem unhappy with the small treat.” “A little while later the ghost appeared. The ghost was very real looking in the moonlight as the slight breeze kept blowing the sheet, which served as the costume. The ghost came from the direction of the driveway and headed east after thanking me for the starlight mint.” Ellen continued as Ed intently listened. “Next came Superman. This boy was a little older and the tight fitting costume showed off a developing, muscular physique. He didn’t seem unhappy with his treat, either.” “Last was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. Before leaving our door, her little dog, dressed as Toto, ran into the street to chase a rabbit in the moonlight. I went outside to make certain everything was OK. ‘Dorothy’ didn’t retrieve her dog until they were several houses up the street.” Which direction did they go? ” “West.” Ed thought a minute and smiled. He said to his wife, “You think you know who all of the five children were? “Yes, I’m certain of it. I know them all from volunteering at the school.” “Good. I know whose parents you need to call.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Where could the tomb-stone and the eggs have been put without being seen?\n    – They were left in the recessed part of the driveway, beside the garage doors, an area that cannot be observed from the front door when Ellen is handing out candy.\n\n2. Who, while coming to the door, actually passed through the driveway area?\n    a. The Witch ‑ approached from the east (the Smiths), crossed the front lawn and walkway, not the driveway.  \n    b. The Lion ‑ was walking with his father along the sidewalk; they, too, came from the front, not the driveway.  \n    c. The Ghost ‑ Ellen says expressly: “The ghost came from the direction of the driveway.”  \n    d. Superman ‑ no approach direction is mentioned.  \n    e. Dorothy ‑ came up the normal front walk (Ellen was able to follow her back down the walk when Toto bolted).\n\n   Only the Ghost is said to have come out of (and therefore already been in) the driveway area, precisely where the prank was later discovered.\n\n3. Could the culprit have planted the tomb-stone before tasting the “meagre” treat?\n    – Yes.  A mischievous child could have arrived with the prop already in hand, set it down unseen in the shadow of the garage, then continued on to the door for candy.  (The egg carton could be hidden under the sheet.)  It would take only seconds, and Ellen’s line of sight never reaches that spot.\n\n4. Why not leave the tomb-stone after receiving the candy?\n    – Because the Ghost left heading east toward the next house; he never returned to the driveway after the visit.  Planting it on the way in is the only moment he was beside the garage.\n\n5. Motive\n    – The verse on the tomb-stone complains about “few treats.”  Any disappointed youngster might do it, but the only one with an undetected opportunity is the Ghost.\n\n6. Alibis\n    – Lion’s father was with him (unlikely to allow egg-throwing).  \n    – Dorothy was pursued and watched by Ellen well down the street.  \n    – Witch and Superman never entered the driveway zone at all.\n\nTherefore the logical deduction is that the child in the Ghost costume had both motive and the unique opportunity, and no one else did.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nThe Witch, The Lion, The Ghost, Superman, Dorothy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nThe child who was dressed as the Ghost (name known to Ellen from school)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nCarrying a small Styrofoam “grave-stone” and two eggs hidden under the loose sheet, the child dressed as a Ghost cut across the McAnns’ driveway on the way to the front porch.  The recessed garage doors shielded him from Ellen’s view.  He set the grave-stone upright in front of the left-hand garage door and tossed the two eggs at it, letting them break and run.  He then walked the remaining few yards to the porch, called out “Trick or Treat,” received a single starlight mint, thanked Ellen, and continued east to the next house as though nothing had happened.  The prank was discovered the following morning when Ed opened the garage door to leave for work.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• The Witch: approached from the east and never went near the driveway; Ellen could see her the whole time.  \n• The Lion: was accompanied by his father, who would not have allowed vandalism and who also never entered the driveway.  \n• Superman: we are given no indication he was ever in the driveway, so he lacked the unobserved opportunity that the Ghost had.  \n• Dorothy: Ellen actually stepped outside and watched her for some distance while she retrieved Toto; she was in full view and could not have slipped back to the driveway unnoticed.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

But, between sips she said, “So, it has to be the witch.”\n“Yes, it does.
