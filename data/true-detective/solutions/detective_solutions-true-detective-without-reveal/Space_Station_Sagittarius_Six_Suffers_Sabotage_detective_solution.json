    "full_text": "Lt. Commander Cecelia Holman was jolted awake by the screech of the security siren. She leapt out of her bunk, donned her skinsuit, dashed down the corridor and was in the station security office in 15 minutes flat. “Report, Sergeant,” she ordered as she slipped into her command chair. “Ma'am! Engineering reports a security breach in the shield generator compartment. Shield status has gone from standby to inoperative. Fault diagnostics determined the shield structure control unit had failed. Lt. Erikson ordered the spare from stores before heading for the compartment. The Stores computer informs us the spare is no longer in inventory and Lt. Erikson has found that the SSCU hasn't failed, but has been removed, Ma'am. The security alarm was immediately activated and the station military section has been sealed.” Before Cecilia could respond, the security alarm changed to the deep tones of “Battle Stations” and her console lit with an incoming call from the station's military exec, Captain Phillips. Cecilia keyed acceptance and his craggy face appeared on the screen. “Commander, we have multiple, unscheduled hyperspace arrivals. The timing is highly suspicious. We need full shield capability. They’ll reach controlled missile range in six hours. I need you to do your Sherlock Holmes act, Holman. First priority: find one of the control units. Second: find and lock down our saboteur.\" He paused a moment, then, \"Do your best, Ceci, we're relying on you.” “Aye, aye, Skipper!” Cecelia responded. Cutting the connection, Cecilia looked at her team leaders and began issuing orders. *** Two hours later, they gathered in the security conference room to review progress. “Sergeant Benson, your team had personnel checks. Status, please?” “Ma'am, 18 personnel have the expertise to remove the SSCU without setting off security alerts. Fifteen of these have alibis for the time period in question. The remaining three are Lt. Erikson’s duty techs, Valance and Bennington, and Master Sgt. O'Hennessey. I also brought in Lt. Erikson since she missed the alert. They’re all in detention, Ma'am.” “What do we have on their backgrounds?” “Nothing indicative, Ma'am. Valance was commended for bravery when the Ravshek took Herstog. His wife and son didn't get off-planet. He hates the Ravers – not a surprise since they eat human flesh! CIT has verified the incoming ships as Ravshek, so it's unlikely he's our saboteur. “He and Bennington were working on a control shunt in corridor B32 that has been causing problems for the last four days. Both have insulation smears on hands and uniform sleeves that confirm this and Valance says Bennington was there the whole time. They’re only still suspects because both have the capability and are each others' alibi.” “The others?” “O'Hennessey is in for his fourth five-year stretch. Excellent duty ratings, but some black marks for off-duty public brawling and operating a still.” “Erikson and Bennington?” “The lieutenant was a corporal, Ma'am, sent to OTC on the recommendation of her battalion CO Major Hilton. She was 47th in her class of 100. There's nothing official, but the secured section of her personnel dossier includes a suspicion that her relationship with the Major may have breeched fraternization regulations. “Bennington's ratings indicate a so-so technical ability; it's questionable he could have removed the SSCU without setting off alarms. He has a reputation as a ladies' man.” “I see. Have Erikson, Valance and Bennington placed in an interview room together and O’Hennessey in a separate interview room.\" Cecilia turned to her next team leader. “Sergeant Devallier, civilian activity?” “We've interviewed all civilians that entered the military sector bar one, a Villiasoo trader called Scrivine. He had a meeting with the quartermaster at 0300 hours; wanted to sell some luxury foodstuffs for the officer's mess. Came in on the 'Cheeanie' seven hours ago and requested an immediate meeting on the basis of a tight shipping schedule. He had a security detail from reception to the quartermaster's and back. He left the military sector at 0324 hours. Cpl. Devon, who led the detail, says Scrivine had no unescorted access anywhere. He confirms that Valance and Bennington who were working in corridor B32 when they passed. Scrivine did chat with and give samples to some of the crew, including Valance.” “Hmmm ... the Villiasoo are supposedly neutral, but I've heard they're more 'neutral' towards the Ravshek than to us. Sgt. Billings, what have you managed to put together from the logs?” “Ma'am, the SSCU was disabled at 0346 hours. Lt. Erikson was on duty but somehow missed it at that time. She posted her inventory request for the spare at 0401, in response to the 0400 maintenance report. The 0300 to 0400 inventory log was deleted, the 0200 to 0300 log archived normally and the 0400 to 0500 log initiated normally; but whoever removed the spare SSCU must have wiped the log. Inventory status can't be manually altered; the SSCU spare was there at 0300 and gone at 0400. Total parts count was reduced by three during that period. We’ve accounted for two. The third had to be the SSCU.” “Probably. Anything else?” “The last garbicle ejection from military sector was 17 hours ago. I let Hermes know straight off, Ma'am.” “Good. Sgt. Hernandez, search status?” “Ma'am, teams are searching all compartments, but it's going to take time. With Sgt. Billings' confirmation that the garbage hasn’t been frozen and ejected I've had a team scan the compartment. No components intrinsic to SSCUs were detected.” “I want an eyeball search, please, Sergeant.” “Aye aye, Ma'am.” “And have a security tech check the repair work in B32. I want to know about anything even minutely unusual.” *** Cecelia was at her workstation, reviewing video feeds from the brig. O'Hennessey had a visitor, a security sergeant who shouldn’t be there. She keyed the feed for sound. “...ring squad for you this time, Oh Hen-sick-be!” sneered the sergeant. “In your dreams, Bannick. With Sherlock in charge of the investigation, she'll find the saboteur, which sure as heck ain't me!” In the other room, Lieutenant Erikson was pacing while Valance and Bennington sat at the table. Erikson's uniform was immaculate until she turned round to pace the other way. Two handprints, the color of insulation foam and of a size to match Bennington’s, on her lower back marred the otherwise perfection. Cecelia’s comm buzzed. It was Sgt. Hernandez. “Ma'am, the team in the garbage disposal just found a woman's finger. It's been sent for DNA analysis. And the tech checking the repairs in B32 found two lighting controllers hidden in the insulation; they're brand new, still sealed in plastic wrap.” “Thank you, Hermes, that’s exactly what I needed to know.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   •  Valance – sworn hatred of the Ravshek; helping them makes no sense.  \n   •  Bennington – no political motive is mentioned; nothing to gain.  \n   •  O’Hennessey – long-service NCO who likes brawls and boot-legging, not treason; again no motive.  \n   •  Scrivine – an alien trader, but he cannot get near the shield generator and is watched every second.  \n   •  Lt. Erikson – the only person whose loyalty is even hinted at as doubtful (“secured section … suspicion that her relationship with the Major may have breached fraternisation regulations”).  If she is already willing to risk her career for a relationship, black-mail or covert recruitment by the Ravshek becomes possible.  She, unlike the others, would profit by a quick promotion if the station falls.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   •  Only four people (Erikson, Valance, Bennington, O’Hennessey) had the technical skill.  \n   •  The saboteur had to be able to:  \n        a) open the highly-controlled parts store,  \n        b) delete an inventory log,  \n        c) walk into the shield generator space and lift out the SSCU,  \n        d) issue an innocent-looking requisition for the missing spare.  \n      An on-duty engineering officer, Lt. Erikson, can do all four without attracting notice.  \n   •  Valance & Bennington were seen in corridor B-32 at 03 15 and had to keep working there – insulation is all over them.  \n   •  O’Hennessey was nowhere near Stores or the generator at the critical times (his whereabouts are not fixed, but he had no authorised reason to be in either place).\n\n3. Physical evidence  \n   •  Two perfectly new lighting-controllers were found stuffed into the very insulation Valance and Bennington had been working in – still in their plastic wrap.  Whoever hid them was NOT trying to use them, only to get rid of them in a place that would incriminate the two techs.  No one but their own section officer would know exactly where the two men were working and think of planting evidence there.  \n   •  Erikson’s otherwise immaculate uniform carries two insulation-foam hand-prints that match Bennington’s gloved hands: she visited the job site shortly before the alarm and therefore had the chance to hide the parts herself.  \n   •  The parts store was short by exactly three items.  Two of those items are the controllers now found; therefore the very person who removed the SSCU also removed those controllers – and that person must be the same one who later hid them in B-32.  \n   •  A woman’s severed finger was discovered in the garbage system.  The only woman under immediate suspicion whose hands are fully intact is Lt. Erikson, so the finger must belong to someone else – almost certainly the (female) assistant quarter-master whose biometric print would open the controlled bin in Stores.  Removing that finger and throwing it down the disposer is something an officer with unlimited compartment access can do, but an enlisted tech on a timed job cannot.\n\n4. Logic chain  \n   a)  The thief removes THREE items between 03 00 and 04 00.  \n   b)  Two are later discovered in a place only the engineering section officer would think of.  \n   c)  Those two items were not even unwrapped, proving they were never intended for use, only to pad out the theft and provide material to frame the duty techs.  \n   d)  The same officer is the only suspect who “missed” the 03 46 fault yet was at the board at the time – a classic false-alarm dodge.  \n   e)  Only that officer had the authority to requisition the spare seconds after the sabotage and so deflect suspicion.  \n   ⇒  therefore the saboteur has to be Lieutenant Erikson.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLt. Annika Erikson, Cpl. Valance, Cpl. Bennington, Master-Sergeant O’Hennessey, Trader Scrivine\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nLt. Annika Erikson\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Shortly after 02 30, Lt. Erikson overpowers the assistant quarter-master, cuts off her finger to gain unrestricted biometric access to the controlled parts lockers, deletes the 03 00–04 00 inventory log and removes three items: the shield-structure control unit and two lighting controllers (the latter purely as decoys so the theft looks like random pilferage).  \n• On her way back to Engineering she shoves the still-wrapped controllers into an open section of insulation in corridor B-32, right where her two techs have been working for days, so that any search will point at them.  Bennington, turning to speak to her, playfully plants his foam-smeared hands on her lower back, leaving the prints that later betray her presence.  \n• At 03 46 she slips into the generator compartment, removes the operating SSCU and carries it to a hiding place still to be located.  The station shields collapse.  \n• She “fails to notice” the security alert until 04 00, then sends a requisition for the spare SSCU she already knows is missing, giving herself a show of diligence while ensuring that no quick repair is possible.  \n• Six hours later the Ravshek task force will arrive to find the station unshielded – unless Lt-Cmdr Holman stops her first.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Cpl. Valance – hates the Ravshek and was continuously occupied in B-32; the parts hidden there were still sealed and therefore not connected with his repair work.  \n• Cpl. Bennington – same enforced location and work; his only offence is flirtation (the foam hand-prints).  \n• Master-Sergeant O’Hennessey – no motive beyond petty misconduct, and there is no evidence he ever approached Stores or the generator.  \n• Trader Scrivine – permanently escorted, no access to the generator, and nothing was carried off-station.  His presence was merely a coincidence used by Erikson because it guaranteed legitimate movement in Stores at 03 00.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "correct_answer": "(d) Sgt.Valance",
    "reveal_text": "Sgt. Hernandez, please go check where the lighting control units are stored. You will find the SSCU units there I believe. Arrest Valance and release the others. It is clear what happened. Scrivine could not have done it himself because he left the military sector right before the sabotage happened. O’Hennessey had no motive and Erikson and Bennington were obviously romantically attached, which is why Valance used Bennington to distract him.\nThe woman's finger shows us his motivation. An agent working for the Ravshek told him his wife was still alive. On the hope that the Ravshek would keep their word and free his wife and son, he agreed to carry out the sabotage when he was signaled to do so. Even though it was likely to mean his own death, either killed by the attacking Ravshek fleet or executed for treason. I think Scrivine signaled Valance that it was time to sabotage the shields by giving him his wife’s finger. Valance encouraged Bennington to seek out Erikson, offering to cover for him, thus freeing himself from observation.\nKnowing that Erikson was otherwise engaged, Valance first removed the SSCU from the shield generator compartment and then went to stores. He extracted the spare SSCU and two lighting controllers and then stored the two SSCUs under the code for the lighting controllers. He then deleted the log so that what he had done wouldn't be obvious. Needing to get back before Bennington, Valance was left with no choice but to hide the lighting controllers in the insulation. He knew that scanners set to locate SSCUs would not detect them.\nPhilips had a shield generated without structural control when the Ravshek launched a testing salvo of missiles. Confident their stratagem had worked, the Ravshek fleet had come in too close when the shield englobed the station, making it invulnerable. They were in the station's controlled missile range for two hours and thirty-seven minutes. Three battered survivors of the sixteen-strong Ravshek fleet escaped back into hyperspace.",

She leapt out of her bunk, donned her skinsuit, dashed down the corridor and was in the station security office in 15 minutes flat. “Report, Sergeant,” she ordered as she slipped into her command chair. “Ma'am! Engineering reports a security breach in the shield generator compartment. Shield status has gone from standby to inoperative. Fault diagnostics determined the shield structure control unit had failed. Lt. Erikson ordered the spare from stores before heading for the compartment. The Stores computer informs us the spare is no longer in inventory and Lt. Erikson has found that the SSCU hasn't failed, but has been removed, Ma'am. The security alarm was immediately activated and the station military section has been sealed.” Before Cecilia could respond, the security alarm changed to the deep tones of “Battle Stations” and her console lit with an incoming call from the station's military exec, Captain Phillips. Cecilia keyed acceptance and his craggy face appeared on the screen. “Commander, we have multiple, unscheduled hyperspace arrivals. The timing is highly suspicious. We need full shield capability. They’ll reach controlled missile range in six hours. I need you to do your Sherlock Holmes act, Holman. First priority: find one of the control units. Second: find and lock down our saboteur.\" He paused a moment, then, \"Do your best, Ceci, we're relying on you.” “Aye, aye, Skipper!” Cecelia responded. Cutting the connection, Cecilia looked at her team leaders and began issuing orders. *** Two hours later, they gathered in the security conference room to review progress. “Sergeant Benson, your team had personnel checks. Status, please?” “Ma'am, 18 personnel have the expertise to remove the SSCU without setting off security alerts. Fifteen of these have alibis for the time period in question. The remaining three are Lt. Erikson’s duty techs, Valance and Bennington, and Master Sgt. O'Hennessey. I also brought in Lt. Erikson since she missed the alert. They’re all in detention, Ma'am.” “What do we have on their backgrounds?” “Nothing indicative, Ma'am. Valance was commended for bravery when the Ravshek took Herstog. His wife and son didn't get off-planet. He hates the Ravers – not a surprise since they eat human flesh! CIT has verified the incoming ships as Ravshek, so it's unlikely he's our saboteur. “He and Bennington were working on a control shunt in corridor B32 that has been causing problems for the last four days. Both have insulation smears on hands and uniform sleeves that confirm this and Valance says Bennington was there the whole time. They’re only still suspects because both have the capability and are each others' alibi.” “The others?” “O'Hennessey is in for his fourth five-year stretch. Excellent duty ratings, but some black marks for off-duty public brawling and operating a still.” “Erikson and Bennington?” “The lieutenant was a corporal, Ma'am, sent to OTC on the recommendation of her battalion CO Major Hilton. She was 47th in her class of 100. There's nothing official, but the secured section of her personnel dossier includes a suspicion that her relationship with the Major may have breeched fraternization regulations. “Bennington's ratings indicate a so-so technical ability; it's questionable he could have removed the SSCU without setting off alarms. He has a reputation as a ladies' man.” “I see. Have Erikson, Valance and Bennington placed in an interview room together and O’Hennessey in a separate interview room.\" Cecilia turned to her next team leader. “Sergeant Devallier, civilian activity?” “We've interviewed all civilians that entered the military sector bar one, a Villiasoo trader called Scrivine. He had a meeting with the quartermaster at 0300 hours; wanted to sell some luxury foodstuffs for the officer's mess. Came in on the 'Cheeanie' seven hours ago and requested an immediate meeting on the basis of a tight shipping schedule. He had a security detail from reception to the quartermaster's and back. He left the military sector at 0324 hours. Cpl. Devon, who led the detail, says Scrivine had no unescorted access anywhere. He confirms that Valance and Bennington who were working in corridor B32 when they passed. Scrivine did chat with and give samples to some of the crew, including Valance.” “Hmmm ... the Villiasoo are supposedly neutral, but I've heard they're more 'neutral' towards the Ravshek than to us. Sgt. Billings, what have you managed to put together from the logs?” “Ma'am, the SSCU was disabled at 0346 hours. Lt. Erikson was on duty but somehow missed it at that time. She posted her inventory request for the spare at 0401, in response to the 0400 maintenance report. The 0300 to 0400 inventory log was deleted, the 0200 to 0300 log archived normally and the 0400 to 0500 log initiated normally; but whoever removed the spare SSCU must have wiped the log. Inventory status can't be manually altered; the SSCU spare was there at 0300 and gone at 0400. Total parts count was reduced by three during that period. We’ve accounted for two. The third had to be the SSCU.” “Probably. Anything else?” “The last garbicle ejection from military sector was 17 hours ago. I let Hermes know straight off, Ma'am.” “Good. Sgt. Hernandez, search status?” “Ma'am, teams are searching all compartments, but it's going to take time. With Sgt. Billings' confirmation that the garbage hasn’t been frozen and ejected I've had a team scan the compartment. No components intrinsic to SSCUs were detected.” “I want an eyeball search, please, Sergeant.” “Aye aye, Ma'am.” “And have a security tech check the repair work in B32. I want to know about anything even minutely unusual.” *** Cecelia was at her workstation, reviewing video feeds from the brig. O'Hennessey had a visitor, a security sergeant who shouldn’t be there. She keyed the feed for sound. “...ring squad for you this time, Oh Hen-sick-be!” sneered the sergeant. “In your dreams, Bannick. With Sherlock in charge of the investigation, she'll find the saboteur, which sure as heck ain't me!” In the other room, Lieutenant Erikson was pacing while Valance and Bennington sat at the table. Erikson's uniform was immaculate until she turned round to pace the other way. Two handprints, the color of insulation foam and of a size to match Bennington’s, on her lower back marred the otherwise perfection. Cecelia’s comm buzzed. It was Sgt. Hernandez. “Ma'am, the team in the garbage disposal just found a woman's finger. It's been sent for DNA analysis. And the tech checking the repairs in B32 found two lighting controllers hidden in the insulation; they're brand new, still sealed in plastic wrap.” “Thank you, Hermes, that’s exactly what I needed to know.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Cpl. Bennington; (b) Scrivine; (c) Sgt. O'Hennessey; (d) Sgt.Valance",
      "answer": "(d) Sgt.Valance",
      "outcome": "Sgt. Hernandez, please go check where the lighting control units are stored. You will find the SSCU units there I believe. Arrest Valance and release the others. It is clear what happened. Scrivine could not have done it himself because he left the military sector right before the sabotage happened. O’Hennessey had no motive and Erikson and Bennington were obviously romantically attached, which is why Valance used Bennington to distract him.\nThe woman's finger shows us his motivation. An agent working for the Ravshek told him his wife was still alive. On the hope that the Ravshek would keep their word and free his wife and son, he agreed to carry out the sabotage when he was signaled to do so. Even though it was likely to mean his own death, either killed by the attacking Ravshek fleet or executed for treason. I think Scrivine signaled Valance that it was time to sabotage the shields by giving him his wife’s finger. Valance encouraged Bennington to seek out Erikson, offering to cover for him, thus freeing himself from observation.\nKnowing that Erikson was otherwise engaged, Valance first removed the SSCU from the shield generator compartment and then went to stores. He extracted the spare SSCU and two lighting controllers and then stored the two SSCUs under the code for the lighting controllers. He then deleted the log so that what he had done wouldn't be obvious. Needing to get back before Bennington, Valance was left with no choice but to hide the lighting controllers in the insulation. He knew that scanners set to locate SSCUs would not detect them.\nPhilips had a shield generated without structural control when the Ravshek launched a testing salvo of missiles. Confident their stratagem had worked, the Ravshek fleet had come in too close when the shield englobed the station, making it invulnerable. They were in the station's controlled missile range for two hours and thirty-seven minutes. Three battered survivors of the sixteen-strong Ravshek fleet escaped back into hyperspace."
