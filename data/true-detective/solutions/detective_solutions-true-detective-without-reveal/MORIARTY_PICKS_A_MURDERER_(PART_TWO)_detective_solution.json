    "full_text": "Professor Moriarty was pleased with the criminal he had selected to rid London, once and for all, of Sherlock Holmes. Fastidious Fred Fielder was, as his nickname implied, a man who could dress the part, any part. He could be at home in a drawing room in London’s elite West End, or he could disguise himself in a number of costumes to fit into any locale. Furthermore, he was not known in London, having committed his larcenies and occasional murders in Liverpool. Yes, Fastidious Fred was the man for the job. And he’d won the right to do the job, and earn a large amount of money, in a contest carefully arranged by Moriarty. Now, Fastidious Fred’s preparations had been made: He’d sent tickets for a violin concert to Sherlock Holmes. The show was scheduled for the following night. The bait should be irresistible—Holmes loved music if indeed he loved anything or anyone, and the featured soloist, Sarasate, was his special favorite. Sarasate played the violin like that wizard Paganini had done, captivating audiences. And so the trap was set. Fastidious Fred’s plan was in action. Soon, Moriarty would never again have to worry about Holmes spoiling his criminal plans. ***** Sherlock Holmes and Dr. James Watson were looking forward to enjoying the evening of fine violin playing by the virtuoso Sarasate. The tickets had been delivered the previous day by messenger. If asked, the messenger reported as he handed over the envelope, he was only to say they were from an admirer of the great consulting detective. For his trouble, the messenger had been given the generous sum of one shilling. Dr. Watson had advised strongly against accepting the tickets. “Just think, Holmes,” he said, “this may compromise your reputation. If word got about that you were accepting expensive tickets like this from anonymous admirers …” “I hardly think so, Watson,” Holmes replied. “And in fact, I was looking forward to this concert. Sarasate is quite the finest violinist playing in the concert halls today. It is a privilege to hear him, and you know, when I sent over to buy tickets a few days ago, they were all sold out.” “Were they?” “They were. This unexpected gift suggests several possibilities, Watson. One of which is what they purport to be at face value.” Watson snorted. “It seems to me that someone had the tickets, and then just decided not to use them. It was one of your admirers, surely. A nice gesture, I call it.” “Well, you are partly right. Someone had the seats, and then sent them to us just yesterday. It could have been simply a generous gesture. But since the concert has been sold out for several days, my anonymous admirer has had these tickets for a while—long enough to formulate a plan, I should think. So we cannot exclude the possibility of a more sinister purpose.” “Good heavens, Holmes. Do you mean that this may actually be a trap of some sort?” “I do hope so, Watson. Things have been tedious of late. The music will be entertaining, and it could just sharpen our wits for what may happen later in the evening.” ***** To Watson’s amazement, as the two men had descended from their quarters to Baker Street, a hansom cab awaited them. “It’s all arranged, gentlemen,” said the smartly dressed cab driver. He shifted the reins into his left hand to lift his hat to Holmes and Watson. “You’ll be at the concert hall in a jiffy.” “And will you be taking us back after the concert?” Holmes asked. “I know nothing about that, sir,” the cabbie replied, “so you should probably hire your own cab for the return.” “More and more interesting,” Holmes muttered, as he and Dr. Watson entered the cab. Upon arriving at the concert hall, Holmes stopped at the ticket office. “Why do that, old man? We’ve got our tickets already,” said Watson. Holmes had a quick conversation with the ticket seller, then returned to where Watson stood. “She remembers it perfectly well, Watson, even though the sale was five days ago. She notices details; all the more so since she is not allowed to leave her ticket booth during performances, in case a latecomer arrives. We have special box seats, it appears. Right next to the Royal Box, in fact, and this very box was specifically requested by the purchaser. And the curious thing is that there are three seats in our box, and all three were sold at the same time.” “Who bought them?” “A man in his mid-forties, tall and well dressed.” Holmes spun his mental file of suspects, his brain a computer before computers were invented. “Yes, the problem is more and more interesting. I wonder, now...” They were shown to their box by the theater usher. Holmes noticed a plainclothes policeman whom he recognized standing on duty just outside the Royal Box. “I hope you will enjoy the concert, gentlemen,” the usher said, pocketing the tip that Watson gave him. Closing the door behind them, he added, “I’ll see you at intermission, if you would like to order drinks.” Holmes waited a moment, got up from his seat, left the box, and approached the policeman outside the Royal Box. Yes, he learned, the Queen was expected to be in attendance. No, it had not been announced. She would arrive during the intermission. “Then there is just enough time,” Holmes said. He scribbled a note to Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, and gave it to the policeman to deliver. Holmes then he settled down next to Dr. Watson to enjoy the concert. Loud applause followed the final notes of the first half of the concert. The concertgoers gradually stood and stretched. Several began to make their way to the bar, others headed outside for a breath of fresh air. “So you got my note, Inspector Lestrade?” Holmes asked as the inspector approached through the crowd with several of his men. “Yes, indeed,” the Scotland Yard detective answered. “The policeman on duty has been with us for years, and is one of our most reliable men. I hope we are in good time.” He joined Watson and Holmes in the third seat of their box. Their usher peered in to see that everything was all right. Then, a few minutes later, he returned with a tray holding three drinks, proclaiming, “Compliments of the house.” “I could prolong the puzzle, gentlemen,” said Holmes, “but that would not be right, with Her Majesty expected. You should perhaps make an arrest, Lestrade. Then we will surely all enjoy the rest of the concert.” He whispered something to Lestrade. As the policemen went to make the arrest, Holmes leaned over the rail of the box, searching the audience below. As expected he saw Professor Moriarty in the audience, regaining his seat. Holmes smiled, Moriarty frowned, and each man knew that another Moriarty plot had been foiled by the great detective, Sherlock Holmes. Raising his drink, Dr. Watson asked Holmes what had happened.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  Only one person in the story is said to have an urgent reason to see Sherlock Holmes dead: Professor Moriarty.  \n   •  Moriarty, however, never does his own dirty work; he “selected” Fastidious Fred Fielder for the assassination.  \n   •  Fielder therefore has the immediate motive (a large fee and Moriarty’s favour); Moriarty the ultimate motive.  \n   •  No one else in the tale is given any reason to wish Holmes or the Queen harm.\n\n2.  Opportunity  \n   •  The seats were bought five days earlier by “a man in his mid-forties, tall and well dressed.”  Nothing prevents that man from being Fielder.  \n   •  Three seats were bought; only two are delivered to Holmes and Watson.  The third must be reserved for the would-be killer, who needs to be in or near the box.  \n   •  When the concert begins the third seat is empty; during the interval Lestrade takes it.  Therefore the original purchaser never intended to sit there openly—he would come in another guise.  \n   •  Who, at the interval, is able to approach the box freely and lean right over the two men?  The theatre usher.  No one challenges an usher carrying a tray “compliments of the house.”  \n   •  Fastidious Fred is a celebrated master of disguise.  Posing as an usher fits him perfectly.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / behaviour  \n   •  The usher has already had one close look at Holmes and Watson when he “showed them to their box” before the performance.  \n   •  He then disappears – exactly what a man in disguise would do while changing costume or preparing a second approach.  \n   •  He re-appears during the interval with three drinks.  Poisoning is the simplest, surest way of killing in full view of a crowded theatre; no shot need be fired and no mêlée caused with a policeman standing two yards away outside the Royal Box.  \n   •  “Compliments of the house” is a lie; neither the management nor the bar sent complimentary drinks.  Only the man who wants Holmes dead would have a reason to bring them.\n\n4.  Holmes’s deductions  \n   •  Tickets for a sold-out recital arrive anonymously: suspicious.  \n   •  The exact box next to the (secretly expected) Royal Box was requested: whoever bought the tickets already knew the Queen would attend and planned the setting well in advance.  \n   •  Three seats were purchased but only two delivered: the sender plans to be in the same box in another identity.  \n   •  At the interval the usher first merely “peers in”, checking that Watson and Holmes are still there; a few minutes later he returns with drinks—time enough to lace them with poison.  \n   •  Holmes therefore scribbles to Lestrade, asking for support and for the genuine officers to lie in wait until the interval.  \n   •  When the usher arrives the second time, Holmes already has Lestrade in the third chair; one whisper is all that is needed for Lestrade’s men to seize the man the moment he leaves the box.\n\n5.  Result  \n   •  The policemen go out and arrest the usher – who, once unmasked, proves to be Fastidious Fred Fielder.  \n   •  Moriarty, sitting among the ordinary audience, can only watch his plot collapse.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFastidious Fred Fielder, Professor James Moriarty, the theatre usher (alias), the cab driver, the ticket-office clerk, the plain-clothes policeman outside the Royal Box\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nFastidious Fred Fielder (appearing in disguise as the theatre usher)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nProfessor James Moriarty (instigator and pay-master)  \nNone of the on-scene theatre staff were knowingly involved.\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Five days before the concert Fastidious Fred Fielder, acting on Moriarty’s instructions, buys the three-seat box next to the Royal Box.  \n•  He keeps one ticket, mails the other two to Holmes and Watson to lure them into the spot chosen for the murder.  \n•  Fielder has already learned (through Moriarty’s underworld channels) that Queen Victoria will attend privately during the interval; that ensures the presence of police whose attention will be directed toward the Royal Box, not Holmes’s.  \n•  On the night, Fielder first dresses as a hansom-cab driver to deliver Holmes and Watson, confirming that they have taken the bait.  \n•  He next changes into a regulation usher’s uniform, meets the pair at the door of their box and notes their positions.  \n•  During the first half he is backstage preparing poison and a cover story (“Compliments of the house”).  \n•  Meanwhile Holmes notices every oddity: sold-out seats, the third unused ticket, the box’s location, the sudden appearance of a paid cab, and, above all, an usher who seems more interested in his guests than in the rest of the audience.  He warns Scotland Yard by note.  \n•  Interval: Fielder brings three poisoned drinks.  The moment he steps out again Lestrade’s men, posted by prior arrangement, arrest him and remove the tray for analysis.  \n•  From their box Holmes and Moriarty exchange their silent salute-and-frown: the master criminal has lost another round.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Professor Moriarty conceived the plot but never took a direct hand in the attempt; he therefore is an accomplice, not the man who physically tried to murder Holmes.  \n•  The cab driver at the beginning was merely another disguise of Fielder; no separate cabbie helped him.  \n•  The plain-clothes policeman was known personally to Holmes and confirmed by Lestrade; he had neither motive nor opportunity.  \n•  The ticket-office clerk merely sold the seats and, by remembering the buyer, helped Holmes.  \n•  No member of the genuine theatre staff sent free drinks; they were unaware of the plot.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Holmes was right to suspect a hidden motive for the concert tickets from his anonymous admirer. One of the persons who Holmes and Watson dealt with was the would-be killer in disguise, Fastidious Fred Fielder, hired by Moriarty to kill the great detective. It could not be the Hansom Cab Driver, since he was merely chosen to deliver Holmes and Watson to the theater. He made no arrangement to pick them up again after the performance. The Ticker Seller was helpful to Holmes, and she could not leave her ticket selling booth during the performance. Similarly, the Policeman was well situated to do harm, but he was a trusted, known man, according to Inspector Lestrade. Holmes knew him by sight.\n\nThat leaves the Theater Usher. He was the killer in disguise, and the drinks that he served contained poison. The murders were even to have occurred in the presence of the Queen, whose arrival at the end of intermission would have caused a great stir, which would soon have given way to panic as the murdered men were discovered in the very next box. It would have been the triumph of Professor Moriarty’s criminal career. Instead, it marked another failure in his duel of wits with Sherlock Holmes.",

The music will be entertaining, and it could just sharpen our wits for what may happen later in the evening.” ***** To Watson’s amazement, as the two men had descended from their quarters to Baker Street, a hansom cab awaited them. “It’s all arranged, gentlemen,” said the smartly dressed cab driver. He shifted the reins into his left hand to lift his hat to Holmes and Watson. “You’ll be at the concert hall in a jiffy.” “And will you be taking us back after the concert?” Holmes asked. “I know nothing about that, sir,” the cabbie replied, “so you should probably hire your own cab for the return.” “More and more interesting,” Holmes muttered, as he and Dr. Watson entered the cab. Upon arriving at the concert hall, Holmes stopped at the ticket office. “Why do that, old man? We’ve got our tickets already,” said Watson. Holmes had a quick conversation with the ticket seller, then returned to where Watson stood. “She remembers it perfectly well, Watson, even though the sale was five days ago. She notices details; all the more so since she is not allowed to leave her ticket booth during performances, in case a latecomer arrives. We have special box seats, it appears. Right next to the Royal Box, in fact, and this very box was specifically requested by the purchaser. And the curious thing is that there are three seats in our box, and all three were sold at the same time.” “Who bought them?” “A man in his mid-forties, tall and well dressed.” Holmes spun his mental file of suspects, his brain a computer before computers were invented. “Yes, the problem is more and more interesting. I wonder, now...” They were shown to their box by the theater usher. Holmes noticed a plainclothes policeman whom he recognized standing on duty just outside the Royal Box. “I hope you will enjoy the concert, gentlemen,” the usher said, pocketing the tip that Watson gave him. Closing the door behind them, he added, “I’ll see you at intermission, if you would like to order drinks.” Holmes waited a moment, got up from his seat, left the box, and approached the policeman outside the Royal Box. Yes, he learned, the Queen was expected to be in attendance. No, it had not been announced. She would arrive during the intermission. “Then there is just enough time,” Holmes said. He scribbled a note to Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, and gave it to the policeman to deliver. Holmes then he settled down next to Dr. Watson to enjoy the concert. Loud applause followed the final notes of the first half of the concert. The concertgoers gradually stood and stretched. Several began to make their way to the bar, others headed outside for a breath of fresh air. “So you got my note, Inspector Lestrade?” Holmes asked as the inspector approached through the crowd with several of his men. “Yes, indeed,” the Scotland Yard detective answered. “The policeman on duty has been with us for years, and is one of our most reliable men. I hope we are in good time.” He joined Watson and Holmes in the third seat of their box. Their usher peered in to see that everything was all right. Then, a few minutes later, he returned with a tray holding three drinks, proclaiming, “Compliments of the house.” “I could prolong the puzzle, gentlemen,” said Holmes, “but that would not be right, with Her Majesty expected. You should perhaps make an arrest, Lestrade. Then we will surely all enjoy the rest of the concert.” He whispered something to Lestrade. As the policemen went to make the arrest, Holmes leaned over the rail of the box, searching the audience below. As expected he saw Professor Moriarty in the audience, regaining his seat. Holmes smiled, Moriarty frowned, and each man knew that another Moriarty plot had been foiled by the great detective, Sherlock Holmes. Raising his drink, Dr. Watson asked Holmes what had happened.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Hansom Cab Driver; (b) Policeman; (c) Theater Usher; (d) Ticket Seller",
      "answer": "(c) Theater Usher",
      "outcome": "Holmes was right to suspect a hidden motive for the concert tickets from his anonymous admirer. One of the persons who Holmes and Watson dealt with was the would-be killer in disguise, Fastidious Fred Fielder, hired by Moriarty to kill the great detective. It could not be the Hansom Cab Driver, since he was merely chosen to deliver Holmes and Watson to the theater. He made no arrangement to pick them up again after the performance. The Ticker Seller was helpful to Holmes, and she could not leave her ticket selling booth during the performance. Similarly, the Policeman was well situated to do harm, but he was a trusted, known man, according to Inspector Lestrade. Holmes knew him by sight.\n\nThat leaves the Theater Usher. He was the killer in disguise, and the drinks that he served contained poison. The murders were even to have occurred in the presence of the Queen, whose arrival at the end of intermission would have caused a great stir, which would soon have given way to panic as the murdered men were discovered in the very next box. It would have been the triumph of Professor Moriarty’s criminal career. Instead, it marked another failure in his duel of wits with Sherlock Holmes."
