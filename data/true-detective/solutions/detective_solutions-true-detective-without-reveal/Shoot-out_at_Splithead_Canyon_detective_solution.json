    "full_text": "Special Agent-in-charge Sam Connors looked over the four men standing before him in the pouring rain. Their grim faces were lit up by the jagged lightning that streaked through the sullen sky, their bodies trembling with the rolling thunder that shook the earth all around. “We’re going to get Pee Wee Galento for sure this time,” the big FBI man growled. “Dead or alive!” The men nodded, fedoras dripping. They climbed into the rumbling Ford Model A, Connors behind the wheel and drove off into the storm-wrenched night. The tip had come from an old prospector who’d been digging for gold up in the mountains: a man was holed up in an abandoned mining shack on the edge of Splithead Canyon. The prospector had identified the man as Pee Wee Galento from the FBI Most Wanted poster he’d been shown. The men sat in silence as the car roared along the deserted high Colorado road, listening to the monotonous flapping of the windshield wipers against the windscreen. The surrounding rugged countryside was shrouded in liquid darkness, except when a crashing thunderbolt tore the heavens apart. Pee Wee Galento had knocked over eight banks and gunned down three guards during his five-month crime spree. He’d vowed never to be taken alive. Joe Franklin dug around in the front of his suit jacket; his hand brushing the butt of his .32 revolver nestled in its shoulder harness. He found his pack of cigarettes, shook a coffin nail out and offered it to Chester Morris sitting next to him in the backseat of the car. Chester shook his head, said, “Don’t smoke,” his knuckles white on the barrel of the shotgun cradled between his legs. “These young guys are all into clean livin’ now, huh, Sam?” Joe remarked. He nervously plugged the cancer stick back into the pack and put the pack back into his suit pocket. “How many years you been in law enforcement, anyway, pops?” Big George Ratcliffe asked the third man in the backseat. Joe snorted. “Pops! I’m retiring at the end of the year, as a matter of fact … sonny. Me and the wife are all set for the easy life – just bought a cottage on Lake Avery.” “Not bad, old-timer,” Slim Jameson commented, turning around in the front seat. “Me, I got some things to take care of before I turn in my badge.” He patted his left breast where his .32 was holstered. “Like Pee Wee Galento, for one.” “Plus, you don’t have the dough to live on Easy Street like Joe does,” Big George said, balancing a Thompson submachine gun on his plump knees. “Playin’ the ponies like you do.” Slim grimaced. “Yeah, I got a few debts to pay off, fat guy. But who don’t these days – with the Depression and all?” Big George grunted. “Tell me about it. The bank the missus and I have been dealing at for the past five years just went under. Taking all our dough with it. And us with four kids to feed!” “Why don’t you guys shut up already!” Chester rasped. This was his first manhunt. Sam Connors glanced in the rearview mirror at the pale-faced young man in the back. “Easy, son,” he said. “We’re all in this together. We’ll get our man.” Twenty miles on, they turned off the highway and onto a rutted trail that wound up the side of a mountain. Another hour of bone-jarring, rain-lashed driving brought them to within a hundred yards of the shack perched on the edge of Splithead Canyon. Light leaked out from around the edges of the shade-drawn front window of the shack, smoke from the stovepipe up on the roof. “Big George,” Sam Connors said, “you go around and cover the back in case Pee Wee decides to bust out a window and take a tumble into the canyon. The rest of us are going through the door.” The men piled out of the car and plodded forward. A bolt of lightning flashed and crackled almost directly over their heads, thunder exploding a split-second later. Sam Connors cocked his big, black .45 automatic at the door of the shack. He nodded at his men, then reared back and slammed his huge shoulder into the flimsy plank door. “Put ‘em up, Pee Wee!” he roared. “It’s the end of the line!” The bank robber leapt out of the chair he’d been dozing in, knocking over a table. A bottle and a tin plate crashed to the plank wood floor of the shack, along with stacks and stacks of stolen money – and the Tommy gun Pee Wee had employed to get the loot. He stared at the FBI agents, dazed and unbelieving. Then the lantern hanging overhead suddenly shattered, shot out, plunging the shack into darkness. Gunfire erupted like the thunder all around, muzzles blazing flame, wood splintering and glass shattering and men screaming amidst the hail of hot lead that seemed to pour from every direction. Chester lit the lantern he’d been told to bring with him and tossed it inside the shack, illuminating the carnage. The blasting ceased. The silence was deafening, acrid gunsmoke hanging heavy in the air. The men stared at the bullet-ridden body of Pee Wee Galento slumped over against the far wall of the shack and at the crisp green money scattered all over the floor. “I got a slug in the gut,” Joe grimaced from beside Sam Connors. “I took one in the shoulder myself,” the Special Agent-in-charge replied, fingering the small hole in his trench coat. “I think a bullet winged my ear chief!” Big George yelled from the broken back window of the shack. “But I’m okay.” He was still outside the shack, but his machine gun lay inside on the floor. “I guess I dropped my Tommy in all the excitement,” the agent sheepishly admitted. Sam Connors looked at Slim crouched in a shooting position along the side-wall. “What about you, Slim?” “I think I got a chunk taken out of my thigh. But that don’t matter. We got the crumb,” he gritted, glaring at Pee Wee’s lifeless body, “that’s all that matters.” Sam Connors glanced behind him. “You can come in now, Chester.” The young FBI man slunk into the room, clutching his shotgun. “I was, um, just keeping the front door covered – in case Pee Wee broke through you guys.” Sam Connors grunted, nodding at the bank robber’s gleaming black machine gun lying on the floor. “We got a lot of men shot, and shot at … considering.” “Considering what?” Joe groaned, holding his stomach. “Considering Pee Wee Galento never fired a single shot.” The FBI special agent grimly regarded his men, his .45 level and cocked. “Looks to me like someone else was after this bank loot besides Pee Wee. And I think I know who.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What convinced Sam Connors that none of the bullets in the shack had been fired by Pee Wee?\n   • Pee Wee’s Tommy gun is found lying where he dropped it.  \n   • Its action is closed, the barrel is cool, and the full drum magazine is still in place – unmistakable signs it has not been fired.  \n   • All the fresh bullet-splinters in the shack are .45 ACP slugs sprayed on full automatic; that can only have come from a Thompson identical to the one carried by Big George, not from any .32 or a shotgun.\n\n2. If Pee Wee never fired, where did the storm of lead come from?\n   • Only one of the five agents carried a weapon capable of putting out that blizzard of slugs – Big George Ratcliffe’s Thompson.  \n   • Revolvers (.32s), the .45 automatic and the shotgun could have produced only isolated bangs, not the “hail of hot lead that seemed to pour from every direction”.\n\n3. Where was Big George supposed to be and where is his gun actually found?\n   • Sam sent him “around back to cover the rear”.  \n   • When the lantern is relit, Big George is outside the broken rear window – yet his Thompson is lying INSIDE the shack on the floor.  \n   • The only way that can happen is if Big George climbed in through the window, opened up with his gun, then dived back out, leaving the weapon behind.\n\n4. Motive\n   • A minute before the raid Big George bitterly complained that the bank in which he and his wife had all their savings had collapsed, “…taking all our dough with it. And us with four kids to feed!”  \n   • Of all the men present he is the one who most desperately needs the piles of cash littering the shack.\n\n5. Injuries\n   • Joe (gut), Sam (shoulder) and Slim (thigh) all suffer solid hits; Big George escapes with a harmless “winged ear”.  \n   • Classic pattern of a man who knows in advance where the bullets will be flying.\n\n6. The lantern\n   • The darkness had to be created for the killer to shoot blindly without being identified.  \n   • The bullet that shatters the hanging lantern comes from the rear of the shack – exactly where Big George is creeping up to the window.\n\n7. Everyone else\n   • Chester is still on the front porch with an unfired shotgun – Sam can see that.  \n   • Slim and Joe are caught in the same deadly crossfire; neither had motive strong enough to risk murder, and their small-calibre wounds match incoming Thompson fire, not outgoing shots from their revolvers.\n\nConclusion: only Big George Ratcliffe had motive, opportunity, the correct weapon and the physical possibility of moving his gun from inside to out while leaving himself outside.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSam Connors, Joe Franklin, Slim Jameson, Chester Morris, Big George Ratcliffe\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nBig George Ratcliffe\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• As the squad leaves the car, Connors posts Big George alone at the back window.  \n• Greed and desperation take over. While the others smash through the front door, Big George quietly pushes his Tommy gun muzzle through a crack in the rear window and shoots out the shack’s single lantern.  \n• In total darkness he climbs inside, sprays the room on full automatic, riddling Pee Wee and wounding three fellow agents.  \n• Hearing return-fire and realising he cannot carry the heavy Thompson, he drops it on the floor, scrambles back out the window and deliberately scrapes his ear on the broken glass to give himself a token “wound”.  \n• When Chester relights a second lantern and tosses it in, Big George is already outside, pretending he has been there the whole time.  \n• His plan was to grab a bag of cash when the others lay dead or disabled, then disappear into the night. He never gets the chance because Connors, though hurt, is still on his feet – and the dropped Thompson tells the whole story.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSam Connors – leader, shot in the shoulder; had no need to steal evidence he was about to recover officially.  \nJoe Franklin – near retirement with comfortable savings; badly gut-shot, obviously not the man who planned the ambush.  \nSlim Jameson – owes gambling debts but was in the front line, hit in the thigh; armed only with a .32, impossible to create the automatic burst that filled the shack.  \nChester Morris – inexperienced rookie with an unfired shotgun, remained at the front door; no Thompson, no opportunity.  \nOnly Big George possessed the right weapon, the urgent motive, the solitude to act unseen, and is caught by the single fatal clue – his Thompson lying inside the shack while he claims never to have entered it.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Sure, it could’ve been Joe. Only Joe doesn’t need the money.

He stared at the FBI agents, dazed and unbelieving. Then the lantern hanging overhead suddenly shattered, shot out, plunging the shack into darkness. Gunfire erupted like the thunder all around, muzzles blazing flame, wood splintering and glass shattering and men screaming amidst the hail of hot lead that seemed to pour from every direction. Chester lit the lantern he’d been told to bring with him and tossed it inside the shack, illuminating the carnage. The blasting ceased. The silence was deafening, acrid gunsmoke hanging heavy in the air. The men stared at the bullet-ridden body of Pee Wee Galento slumped over against the far wall of the shack and at the crisp green money scattered all over the floor. “I got a slug in the gut,” Joe grimaced from beside Sam Connors. “I took one in the shoulder myself,” the Special Agent-in-charge replied, fingering the small hole in his trench coat. “I think a bullet winged my ear chief!” Big George yelled from the broken back window of the shack. “But I’m okay.” He was still outside the shack, but his machine gun lay inside on the floor. “I guess I dropped my Tommy in all the excitement,” the agent sheepishly admitted. Sam Connors looked at Slim crouched in a shooting position along the side-wall. “What about you, Slim?” “I think I got a chunk taken out of my thigh. But that don’t matter. We got the crumb,” he gritted, glaring at Pee Wee’s lifeless body, “that’s all that matters.” Sam Connors glanced behind him. “You can come in now, Chester.” The young FBI man slunk into the room, clutching his shotgun. “I was, um, just keeping the front door covered – in case Pee Wee broke through you guys.” Sam Connors grunted, nodding at the bank robber’s gleaming black machine gun lying on the floor. “We got a lot of men shot, and shot at … considering.” “Considering what?” Joe groaned, holding his stomach. “Considering Pee Wee Galento never fired a single shot.” The FBI special agent grimly regarded his men, his .45 level and cocked. “Looks to me like someone else was after this bank loot besides Pee Wee. And I think I know who.”",

      "answer": "(d) Slim Jameson",
      "outcome": "“What!? Who?” Joe gasped. “Who’s the dirty rat who’d ambush his own colleagues?”\nSam Connors pointed his big gun at Slim. “Drop the heater, Jameson,” he ordered. “You’re not getting the loot – over any of our dead bodies.”\nChester swung his shotgun around on Slim, backing up his boss. “Why Slim?” he asked.\n“It figures. Joe and I were both hit by single bullets, not a shotgun blast. And not two or three chunks of lead in a row, like from a machine gun. That lets you and Big George out. Not to mention, you weren’t even in the room, and Big George dropped his chopper … in all the excitement.”\nSlim’s hatchet face went white as lightning. “It-It coulda been Joe!” he squealed. “Yeah, he just shot himself to cover up!”\n“Like you said you’re shot – to cover up? Sure, it could’ve been Joe. Only Joe doesn’t need the money. He and his wife just bought a cottage on Lake Avery, or didn’t you hear?” Sam Connors steely grey eyes narrowed, his blunt finger tightening on the trigger of his gun. “But you needed the money, Slim. To pay off all those gambling debts of yours.”\nSlim’s smoking .32 had been hanging down at his side. And now it suddenly jerked up.\nBut the slim man wasn’t fast enough. He joined Pee Wee Galento on the floor of the shack."
