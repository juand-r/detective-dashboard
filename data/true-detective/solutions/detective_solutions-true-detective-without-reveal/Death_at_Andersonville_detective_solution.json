    "full_text": "Andersonville Military Prison, deep in the heart of Dixieland Georgia, was the most dreaded of Confederate prisoner-of-war camps. It was such a grim place that the rebel soldiers guarding it were fed and clothed little better than their 33,000 Yankee prisoners. From its inception in February 1864, until the Civil War’s end 14 months later, 13,000 prisoners would die; an astonishing 29% mortality rate. Many of the Union soldiers succumbed to starvation and exposure to the elements, but some were also murdered, as was the case with Private Glendenning Bryan. Sgt. Crosby, Sgt. Thornton, Pvt. Whisenant and Cpl. Horner shared a tent with Pvt. Bryan – if you could call a few small tree limbs that served as poles, plus a few tattered blankets and threadbare shirts, shelter at all. Because the tent was so small, privacy was virtually non-existent, and this only added to the shock and dismay when the friendly Bryan, a young 19-year-old from Boston, was found dead with a knife wound in his stomach when the sun came up early one steamy Monday morning in August 1864. Crosby, the 38-year-old no-nonsense senior non-commissioned officer and Chicago, Illinois, policeman, took charge. Speaking within the confines of the small tent, he said, “He’s murdered, murdered right here. I don’t know why, he would’ve been dead in a few days anyway.” Bryan had been in Andersonville the longest and was the most malnourished and sickest of the five. However, they soon discovered why Bryan had been killed. He had been hoarding food in his clothing, planning to eat it when he felt better. Inside his trousers they found a crudely sewn, hidden pocket that contained breadcrumbs and a few tiny pieces of salt pork. The likable Bryan had been killed for food. “Well, it wasn’t me that did it,” said the short-tempered Horner, another native of Massachusetts, as he viewed his friend who lay dead just inches from his bare feet. “My hands are useless with arthritis and I can’t hardly hold a knife.” Horner was 40-years-old and had spent too many years shoeing horses in the cold weather of his home in Worcester. “It couldn’t have been me,’ chimed in Thornton. “I was outside walking most of the night.” “Most of the night is not all of the night,” Crosby pointedly replied. Thornton, a 26-year-old librarian from Philadelphia and quietest of the residents of the tent, winced at this suggestion. “Did anyone see you?” asked Crosby. Thornton looked at each man in turn before answering, “Nobody saw me, but I was out walking last night. I was.” “I was sick, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, so I was down by the sinks all night,” offered Whisenant, the normally amiable 30-year-old New York school teacher. “I got back here just a few minutes ago.” Crosby hadn’t slept in the tent the previous night, either, and told them so. “I was at the other end of the camp, trying to get what fresh night air was available.” That was an ironic statement, as it was known that the stench from Andersonville was so severe it was noticed in the city of Americus, several miles away. “I didn’t notice any of you fellers last night. Just me and Bryan,” said Horner, thinking out loud. Slowly, he asked, “Who owns the knife?” “Answer that and we have our killer,” Thornton added, dryly. For a few minutes they all sat in silence. Finally, Crosby said, “I got back here first. I found Horner asleep and Bryan dead.” Horner shot Crosby a mean look, pointed a gnarled finger at him and said, “I told you I didn’t kill him!” He winced in pain as he did so. “Easy, corporal, easy, I’m just thinking.” “Well, for whatever it’s worth to you, I didn’t sleep well,” Horner said. “Who does in this place? I was asleep for only an hour or two and did not see or hear anything, except the usual camp noises.” “OK, let’s continue,” said Crosby. “I was on the other side of the camp with various friends; not with any one person the entire night, but I was never alone.” Turning to Thornton, he asked, “What about you? Horner didn’t sleep well, says he didn’t see you.” “He probably didn’t. I only came back to the tent a couple of times. When I heard him snoring, I did not go in. I didn’t want to bother him. The last time was about an hour ago. It was too dark to notice anything unusual about Bryan.” Crosby digested this for a moment and then asked Whisenant, “You were sick last night?” “Right,” he replied. The sight and shock of the dead Bryan did nothing to quiet his queasiness, although he was a butcher by trade in his hometown of Zeeland, Michigan. With great effort, he managed to control a wave of nausea. He needed to go outside and Crosby excused him. Whisenant returned a few minutes later, weak but feeling better. He dreaded resuming the conversation, but he re-seated himself in the cramped tent and looked at Crosby. Finally, Crosby stated bluntly, “I know who killed Bryan.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Every man is starving, so all have a possible motive, but the one who actually knew that Bryan was alone with him and would not be overheard had the strongest, safest chance to act.  \n2. Opportunity  \n   • The tent is so small that anyone entering or leaving has to step over the sleepers.  \n   • By their own statements only one man admits to having been in the tent with Bryan for practically the whole night: Corporal Horner – “I didn’t notice any of you fellers last night. Just me and Bryan.”  \n   • All the others claim to have spent the night elsewhere; Crosby even says he found only Horner in the tent when he returned at dawn.  \n3. Physical evidence / circumstances  \n   • Bryan was stabbed in the stomach and then searched for food hidden inside his trousers.  That would have taken a little time and made some noise.  Pulling at a dead man’s clothing in a space where bodies are almost touching without waking a second sleeper is next to impossible – therefore the second sleeper had to be the killer himself.  \n   • Horner tries to ward off suspicion in advance by stressing that his arthritic hands are “useless” and that he “can’t hardly hold a knife.”  Yet a few minutes later he points an accusing finger at Crosby.  If he can do that he can certainly grip a knife long enough to thrust once.  \n   • Horner also tries to divert attention with the question “Who owns the knife?” – something only the owner-killer would be sure everybody else could not answer.  \n4. Alibis checked  \n   • Crosby – says he was with groups of men on the far side of the stockade; that can be verified.  \n   • Thornton – out walking; at one point returns, hears Horner snoring and leaves again.  That fits Horner’s being in the tent alone with Bryan.  \n   • Whisenant – down by the sinks, obviously ill; several prisoners would have seen him there.  \n   • Horner – no alibi at all except his claim that he slept lightly.  Yet no one came into the tent while he was there?  Impossible unless he himself did the deed before dozing off.  \n\nLogical deduction:  \nOnly the man who admits being alone with Bryan had the uninterrupted opportunity to stab, search the body and settle down again without risk of being seen.  All the defensive statements he volunteers (bad hands, “Who owns the knife?”) are classic guilty deflections.  Therefore Crosby’s conclusion must be that Corporal Horner is the killer.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSgt. Richard Crosby, Sgt. William Thornton, Pvt. Daniel Whisenant, Cpl. Charles Horner\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCpl. Charles Horner\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nSometime after dark on the steamy Sunday night, the other three tent-mates drifted away in search of slightly fresher air, leaving only Corporal Horner and the badly weakened Private Bryan inside the cramped shelter.  \nHorner, himself desperate with hunger, confronted Bryan after seeing him earlier sew something into his trousers.  When Bryan refused to hand it over, Horner thrust a knife once into Bryan’s stomach.  \nWith Bryan dead and the tent empty, Horner rummaged through the corpse’s clothes, slit open the crude pocket and removed what crumbs and bits of salt pork he could find, swallowing some on the spot.  \nExhausted, he lay back down.  A man with chronic arthritis can still close a fist for one quick stab; afterward he could stretch out and, despite pain, fall into an exhausted sleep.  \nJust before dawn Sergeant Crosby returned and found the scene: Bryan dead, Horner apparently asleep beside him.  In the ensuing questioning Crosby pieced together the simple facts and realised that no one but the man who shared the tent all night could have killed Bryan without being noticed.  Horner was arrested for the murder of Private Glendenning Bryan.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSgt. Richard Crosby – Accounted for throughout the night by different groups of prisoners; would have had to slip into a pitch-dark, crowded tent past the awake Horner, stab, search and leave again without being heard – impossible.  \nSgt. William Thornton – Admits returning twice but never entered when he heard Horner snoring.  His action is confirmed by Horner’s own statement that he alone was in the tent.  If Thornton had gone in, Horner would have seen or heard him.  \nPvt. Daniel Whisenant – Sick down at the sinks, observed by others using the latrines.  He arrived back only minutes before the body was found.  He also could not have entered, killed and searched the body without Horner noticing.  \nOnly Horner had continuous, unsupervised access to Bryan and the chance to carry out the murder unseen.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
