    "full_text": "Hal Feders loved birds: all kinds of birds. He loved watching them, listening to them, feeding them, and, on occasion, eating them and their byproducts. He kept chickens, geese and peacocks on his rural property, and he’d just recently excavated and then watered a large duck pond in back of his house. He hoped to attract a wide range of wild waterfowl with his pond and even had in mind stocking it with a couple of swans. So, he was more than a little excited when he woke up one morning to find a pair of green-headed mallards floating in his brand-new paddling sanctuary. He rushed down to the edge of the pond to welcome his first billed guests. But they quickly duck-paddled away from him, over to the other side of the pond. “Skittish, huh?” Hal said. “Well, I’ll soon fix that.” He ran back to his small barn to get the fifty-pound sack of birdseed he’d purchased in town the previous day. But when he threw the barn door open and looked in the corner where he’d dumped the bag of mixed seeds, he found it gone. Hal searched the entire barn, his chicken coop and the area around both. There was no sack of birdseed. “Am I cuckoo,” he mused, scratching his beak, “or did someone steal my seed?” He could not detect any footprints inside or around his barn, other than the ones he’d made in his search for the missing sack. And the short, gravel driveway that led from his home to the dirt road out front seemed to be devoid of any tire tracks, except for the ones he’d laid down with his pick-up truck the previous afternoon. It was an awful heavy sack of seed for one man or woman to carry too far on foot, so Hal’s suspicions immediately fell on his four neighbors who lived in relatively close proximity to his place. He started off on his quest to find the dirty bird who’d filched his seed, flying across the road and up the driveway of his nearest neighbor, Tor Hansen. “Hey, Tor, have you seen my bag of birdseed!?” he yelled into the screened front door of Tor’s house. The man’s huge body loomed into view behind the wire mesh. “You dumb cluck! Why would I want birdseed? I’ve got forty acres of sunflowers growing out back. The last thing I need is a flock birds. And I don’t appreciate a quack like you bringing them into the neighborhood.” Hal regarded the man’s angry, bearded face. Tor had never been a friendly giant neighbor. “Well … you’ve got a canary, don’t you? I can hear it singing right now.” “Tweeter? He isn’t going to eat a fifty-pound sack of birdseed in a month of Sundays.” “Aha!” Hal crowed. “How’d you know it was a ‘fifty-pound’ sack of birdseed that was missing?” Tor snorted. “I saw you draggin’ it into your barn from my front window yesterday. I’ve got eagle eyes, see.” And with that, the man slammed the inner door in Hal’s face. Hal trudged up the road to the neighbor adjoining the west side of his property, Billy Mumms. As he walked across the man’s green, trimmed front yard, he glanced up at the two large birdhouses sitting atop twenty-foot poles on either side of the lawn. “Hal,” Billy said, bobbing his head in greeting. The angular man with the hawk nose was just coming out of the front door of his house as Hal arrived, a watering can, not a sack of birdseed, in his hand. “Somebody waddled off with a bag of birdseed I just bought,” Hal explained. “Have you seen anyone carrying something like that around, Billy?” The man gave a quick shake of his bony head, eyes darting left and right as he watered the roses that decorated the front of his house. “Hey, Sylvester, get out of there!” he chirped at his cat, hiding amongst the rose bushes. Hal looked up at the birdhouses again. There were four or five purple martins fluttering around the towering feather-nesters. “Say, what’d you feed all those purple martins, Billy?” he casually asked. “There sure are a lot of them.” Billy cocked his head. “Nothing; they eat mosquitoes and other flying insects.” Hal whacked a bloodsucker that had just landed on his arm. “I guess they don’t get all of them,” he said. “Nope. Not all.” Hal walked back down the road, past his and Tor’s property, to Cheryl Judson’s place. The sixty year-old widow lived by herself in a small bungalow just east of Hal’s modest spread. He found her in her backyard, chopping wood. “What’s up, Hal?” Cheryl asked, wiping the sweat from her brow with one hand, clutching her twin-bladed axe with the other. The razor-sharp blades glinted in the sun.\n \nHal glanced from the axe to the creek that ran in back of Cheryl’s house. There was a mama duck and seven fuzzy baby ducks floating close to the far bank of the creek. “Uh, you haven’t seen a fifty-pound bag of birdseed around, have you, Cheryl? I’m missing one.” The woman spat on the ground and ran her finger along one of the blades of the axe. “I don’t have a need for your birdseed, if that’s what you’re squawking about, Hal. I don’t encourage birds or waterfowl – their chirping and quacking keeps me up nights.” “No! No,” Hal squeaked. “I’m not accusing anyone.” He skirted around the woman, closer to the babbling brook, interested in getting a better look at the ducklings. “I’m just, you know … asking around.” Cheryl grunted and placed another piece of firewood on the chopping block. She swung the axe down with a heavy thunk, cleaving the wood clean in two. As Hal watched, the mama duck and her brood swam across the creek towards him, quacking eagerly. “Guess you’ll be going,” Cheryl said, shouldering her axe. “Guess so,” Hal agreed. He waved at the ducks and scooted past Cheryl and across the road. Stan Mifflin lived directly across from Cheryl. The eccentric forty something year old owned a huge, ramshackle house and two equally ramshackle greenhouses. He grew and sold exotic plants, when he wasn’t working on some other project. Today, Hal could see, the chunky man was working on constructing what looked like another greenhouse in the field behind his home. “More space for your Venus flytraps and pitcher plants, Stan?” Hal asked. Stan dropped his saw and shook Hal’s hand, always eager to explain his latest project to any passerby. “No, sir. I’m building an aviary. What do you think of that?” “Really?” Hal responded, with actual interest. “Yes, sir. I’ve already got two scarlet macaws, and I’m going to start breeding them. Here, I’ll show you.” Stan led Hal inside his house and introduced him to two large, colorful birds perched in his kitchen. “Aren’t they beautiful?” he raved. “They are,” Hal agreed, admiring the birds’ bright red, blue and yellow plumage. “And they’re just the start. I’m going to raise all kinds of exotic parrots and cockatoos and such.” “Really? I guess you’re going to need a lot of birdseed, then – to feed them all?” Hal slyly asked. “Awk! Nuts and fresh fruit only, please!” the larger of the two birds cawed in reply, shocking Hal. “They’re pretty picky about their diet,” Stan cackled. “Uh-huh,” Hal said as he and the bird exchanged beady-eyed stares. “Awk! Don’t be a stranger!” it cawed, as Hal exited the house. On the walk back to his own home, Hal thought about all he’d seen and heard during his inquiries.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could use 50 lb of mixed birdseed?  \n   – Tor: despises birds, already fighting them in his sunflower field; only owns one canary that would take years to finish that much seed.  \n   – Billy: keeps purple-martins; these birds are strictly insectivorous – they never eat seed.  \n   – Cheryl: claims she “doesn’t encourage birds”, yet a mother-duck and seven ducklings instantly paddle toward her bank, quacking expectantly.  Those ducks have obviously been hand-fed before, and creek-ducks absolutely do eat grain and mixed seed.  \n   – Stan: breeds macaws; macaws live mainly on nuts, fruit and some kernels, but not on cheap mixed field-bird seed.  He even teaches his bird to say “Nuts and fresh fruit only, please!”, underscoring that seed would be of little use to him.\n\n2. Who had opportunity without leaving tracks or tyre marks?  \n   – The barn and Hal’s yard showed no extra footprints or tyre tracks.  Cheryl’s bungalow is the only one that can be reached on foot over grass and then along her own creek bank, never touching Hal’s gravel drive or barn floor (she could walk round the back of his house, lift the sack, carry/drag it across the grass and down the bank).  \n   – Tor or Billy would have had to come up the gravel drive – no sign of that.  \n   – Stan lives farther away on the other side of the road; again, no tyre marks.\n\n3. Who lied?  Hal suddenly “stopped in his tracks and snapped his fingers, realizing that one of his neighbors had lied.”  \n   – Tor’s remark about “fifty-pound sack” is easily explained: he watched Hal drag it in the day before; nothing false.  \n   – Billy’s statement that he feeds the martins “nothing” is perfectly true.  \n   – Stan’s birds and his own words about “nuts and fresh fruit” are correct for macaws.  \n   – Cheryl, however, says she doesn’t encourage birds because their quacking keeps her awake, yet at that very moment a tame duck family swims toward her shore, quacking for food.  The only reason wild ducks behave like that is because someone on that bank HAS been encouraging and feeding them – plainly Cheryl herself.  Therefore she lied.\n\n4. Once Hal spots the lie, motive + opportunity + need for seed all point to Cheryl.  She stole the sack to keep feeding “her” creek ducks while pretending to dislike them so the neighbours wouldn’t complain.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTor Hansen, Billy Mumms, Cheryl Judson, Stan Mifflin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCheryl Judson\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate in the evening, or very early that morning, Cheryl Judson crossed the narrow strip of grass that separates her property from Hal’s back yard.  She slipped into the open side-door of Hal’s barn, hoisted/dragged the newly purchased 50-pound sack of mixed birdseed out, and carried it along the grass and across her own yard to the creek bank.  Because she never stepped in the barn’s dusty floor or on Hal’s gravel drive, she left no foreign footprints or tyre prints for Hal to find.  Back at the creek she stowed the sack in her woodshed.  Cheryl has secretly been feeding the resident creek-ducks every day, and with ducklings now hatched she suddenly needed a lot more grain.  Rather than buy her own sack in town (and admit that she actually likes the ducks), she simply stole Hal’s.  When Hal came round questioning her, she denied any interest in birds, but the ducks’ eager dash toward her bank betrayed her – and the lie told Hal everything he needed to know.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nTor Hansen: Grows sunflowers and regards birds as pests; one pet canary could never use 50 lbs of seed.  His knowing the weight of the sack was no slip – he literally watched Hal carry it the day before.\n\nBilly Mumms: Owns purple-martins, which eat insects, not seed.  His birdhouses and behaviour are consistent with that.  He would have no reason to steal seed he cannot use.\n\nStan Mifflin: Breeds macaws whose diet is primarily fresh fruit and nuts; even his macaw vocalises that fact.  A bag of cheap mixed seed would be of little value to him, and transporting it from across the road would have left obvious tyre tracks or footprints.\n\nTherefore only Cheryl had both the motive (feeding “her” ducks), the physical possibility (no tracks because she walked over grass directly from yard to yard) and the demonstrable lie that triggered Hal’s deduction.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Cheryl Judson lied to Hal when she said that she didn’t ‘encourage birds or waterfowl. The ducks’ behavior in the creek in back of her property proves she lied: they’d swum across the water towards Hal when he had approached them, as if expecting to be fed. That meant they were used to being fed by humans, like Cheryl.\nNormally, any wild bird or animal will instinctively retreat when a human approaches, as the ducks in Hal’s pond did. But their behavior will change if they come to see humans as a source of food. Like a duck to water, so, too, will quackers enthusiastically take to human-offered birdseed.",

But when he threw the barn door open and looked in the corner where he’d dumped the bag of mixed seeds, he found it gone. Hal searched the entire barn, his chicken coop and the area around both. There was no sack of birdseed. “Am I cuckoo,” he mused, scratching his beak, “or did someone steal my seed?” He could not detect any footprints inside or around his barn, other than the ones he’d made in his search for the missing sack. And the short, gravel driveway that led from his home to the dirt road out front seemed to be devoid of any tire tracks, except for the ones he’d laid down with his pick-up truck the previous afternoon. It was an awful heavy sack of seed for one man or woman to carry too far on foot, so Hal’s suspicions immediately fell on his four neighbors who lived in relatively close proximity to his place. He started off on his quest to find the dirty bird who’d filched his seed, flying across the road and up the driveway of his nearest neighbor, Tor Hansen. “Hey, Tor, have you seen my bag of birdseed!?” he yelled into the screened front door of Tor’s house. The man’s huge body loomed into view behind the wire mesh. “You dumb cluck! Why would I want birdseed? I’ve got forty acres of sunflowers growing out back. The last thing I need is a flock birds. And I don’t appreciate a quack like you bringing them into the neighborhood.” Hal regarded the man’s angry, bearded face. Tor had never been a friendly giant neighbor. “Well … you’ve got a canary, don’t you? I can hear it singing right now.” “Tweeter? He isn’t going to eat a fifty-pound sack of birdseed in a month of Sundays.” “Aha!” Hal crowed. “How’d you know it was a ‘fifty-pound’ sack of birdseed that was missing?” Tor snorted. “I saw you draggin’ it into your barn from my front window yesterday. I’ve got eagle eyes, see.” And with that, the man slammed the inner door in Hal’s face. Hal trudged up the road to the neighbor adjoining the west side of his property, Billy Mumms. As he walked across the man’s green, trimmed front yard, he glanced up at the two large birdhouses sitting atop twenty-foot poles on either side of the lawn. “Hal,” Billy said, bobbing his head in greeting. The angular man with the hawk nose was just coming out of the front door of his house as Hal arrived, a watering can, not a sack of birdseed, in his hand. “Somebody waddled off with a bag of birdseed I just bought,” Hal explained. “Have you seen anyone carrying something like that around, Billy?” The man gave a quick shake of his bony head, eyes darting left and right as he watered the roses that decorated the front of his house. “Hey, Sylvester, get out of there!” he chirped at his cat, hiding amongst the rose bushes. Hal looked up at the birdhouses again. There were four or five purple martins fluttering around the towering feather-nesters. “Say, what’d you feed all those purple martins, Billy?” he casually asked. “There sure are a lot of them.” Billy cocked his head. “Nothing; they eat mosquitoes and other flying insects.” Hal whacked a bloodsucker that had just landed on his arm. “I guess they don’t get all of them,” he said. “Nope. Not all.” Hal walked back down the road, past his and Tor’s property, to Cheryl Judson’s place. The sixty year-old widow lived by herself in a small bungalow just east of Hal’s modest spread. He found her in her backyard, chopping wood. “What’s up, Hal?” Cheryl asked, wiping the sweat from her brow with one hand, clutching her twin-bladed axe with the other. The razor-sharp blades glinted in the sun.\n \nHal glanced from the axe to the creek that ran in back of Cheryl’s house. There was a mama duck and seven fuzzy baby ducks floating close to the far bank of the creek. “Uh, you haven’t seen a fifty-pound bag of birdseed around, have you, Cheryl? I’m missing one.” The woman spat on the ground and ran her finger along one of the blades of the axe. “I don’t have a need for your birdseed, if that’s what you’re squawking about, Hal. I don’t encourage birds or waterfowl – their chirping and quacking keeps me up nights.” “No! No,” Hal squeaked. “I’m not accusing anyone.” He skirted around the woman, closer to the babbling brook, interested in getting a better look at the ducklings. “I’m just, you know … asking around.” Cheryl grunted and placed another piece of firewood on the chopping block. She swung the axe down with a heavy thunk, cleaving the wood clean in two. As Hal watched, the mama duck and her brood swam across the creek towards him, quacking eagerly. “Guess you’ll be going,” Cheryl said, shouldering her axe. “Guess so,” Hal agreed. He waved at the ducks and scooted past Cheryl and across the road. Stan Mifflin lived directly across from Cheryl. The eccentric forty something year old owned a huge, ramshackle house and two equally ramshackle greenhouses. He grew and sold exotic plants, when he wasn’t working on some other project. Today, Hal could see, the chunky man was working on constructing what looked like another greenhouse in the field behind his home. “More space for your Venus flytraps and pitcher plants, Stan?” Hal asked. Stan dropped his saw and shook Hal’s hand, always eager to explain his latest project to any passerby. “No, sir. I’m building an aviary. What do you think of that?” “Really?” Hal responded, with actual interest. “Yes, sir. I’ve already got two scarlet macaws, and I’m going to start breeding them. Here, I’ll show you.” Stan led Hal inside his house and introduced him to two large, colorful birds perched in his kitchen. “Aren’t they beautiful?” he raved. “They are,” Hal agreed, admiring the birds’ bright red, blue and yellow plumage. “And they’re just the start. I’m going to raise all kinds of exotic parrots and cockatoos and such.” “Really? I guess you’re going to need a lot of birdseed, then – to feed them all?” Hal slyly asked. “Awk! Nuts and fresh fruit only, please!” the larger of the two birds cawed in reply, shocking Hal. “They’re pretty picky about their diet,” Stan cackled. “Uh-huh,” Hal said as he and the bird exchanged beady-eyed stares. “Awk! Don’t be a stranger!” it cawed, as Hal exited the house. On the walk back to his own home, Hal thought about all he’d seen and heard during his inquiries. And then, suddenly, he stopped in his tracks and snapped his fingers, realizing that one of his neighbors had lied to him. He tapped the side of his own beak in recognition – knowing now which neighbor had flown the coop with his sack of birdseed.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Billy Mumms; (b) Cheryl Judson; (c) Stan Mifflin; (d) Tor Hansen",
      "answer": "(b) Cheryl Judson",
      "outcome": "Cheryl Judson lied to Hal when she said that she didn’t ‘encourage birds or waterfowl. The ducks’ behavior in the creek in back of her property proves she lied: they’d swum across the water towards Hal when he had approached them, as if expecting to be fed. That meant they were used to being fed by humans, like Cheryl.\nNormally, any wild bird or animal will instinctively retreat when a human approaches, as the ducks in Hal’s pond did. But their behavior will change if they come to see humans as a source of food. Like a duck to water, so, too, will quackers enthusiastically take to human-offered birdseed."
