    "full_text": "At least this time, the commute was worthwhile. For the past few months, I had been spending most of my time in Los Angeles to consult on a new TV show based on a Baltimore Detective. Being the premier Baltimore Detective, at least in my humble opinion, I was hoping that they would call the show “Uncle Buck” after me, but so far no luck. Still, they had chosen me for the honor of being the technical consultant. That had meant constant flights back and forth between Baltimore and LA. This week though, the return flight was worthwhile. This week my beloved Cleveland Browns were going to be playing the Baltimore Ravens. For years since returning to the NFL, the Browns had struggled against all teams. This year was different though as suddenly the Browns were playing well. But in the NFL, when the calendar turns to November, the real football begins. That is crunch time when the winners keep winning and the others start to prepare for next year. For the first time in a long time, on this first weekend in November, the Browns were playing meaningful games. Best of all, I had 50 yard line tickets. I could not wait to get back to Baltimore. As always, I was taking the redeye, leaving LA late Saturday night and arriving in Baltimore Sunday morning. Since most people never sleep much on these flights, everyone arrives with red eyes, thus the name. I however am different. I buckle my seat belt and fall asleep. Taking the plane like this saves me a day of travel time. I just hoped that wearing my Browns jersey on the plane was not going to cause the person next to me to want to chat all night. We boarded the plane and I was relieved to see that the seat next to me was empty. I sat down, buckled my seatbelt and was fast asleep. The next thing I know, I am jolted awake as the plane lands in Baltimore. Just to make sure that no one could have remained asleep through the landing, the flight attendant announced in her ever cheerful voice, “Welcome to Baltimore where the local time is 7:35 am. Please remain in your seats as we taxi to the gate.” That did it, I was officially awake and in need of some coffee. As we taxied to the gate, I turned on my phone to check for messages. I was just setting my watch ahead two hours when my phone rang telling me I had a message marked urgent. The number was my buddy Mike, the director of security for the Ravens and the guy who got me the great seats for today’s game. Worried that he was going to tell me he could not get the tickets after all, I immediately called him back. “Buck”, he said, “we have a major problem and I need your help.” I was relieved, as it did not sound like I was going to lose my tickets, so I asked, “What seems to be the problem?” “Someone stole the film of the Ravens’ last practice. It is the walk through in which they verify all the new plays, defenses, etc. for today’s game. Everyone is convinced the Browns did it. We need to find out what happened and fast.” I told him that I would meet him at the team office in 20 minutes. Mike met me at the front door. After giving me a funny look for showing up at the Raven’s office in a Browns jersey, he quickly explained to me what happened. One of the assistant coaches went into the film room at 6:45 am to take one last look at the film and found that the film was gone. Mike was really upset that something like this could have happened. I told him to calm down and take me through what he knew. The film room is at the end of a hallway. That hallway and two other hallways are covered by a 24-hour video camera. There are three security shifts, with each guard working an 8-hour shift. At the beginning of each shift, they put in a new blank 8-hour tape and it records the three monitors simultaneously. When their shift is over, the new guard takes the old tape out, puts in a new tape and stores the previous tape in order. Each monitor has a date/time stamp on it. The date and time come in off of the Internet, so there is no way that anyone can alter the time shown on the tape. The only person who has access to the video recorder is the security guard who is on duty; last night, that was Tom Barrett. Mike said that they had watched the entire tape. Right at the beginning of the tape Chuck Jarrett, an assistant coach, was seen coming out of the film room. A little after midnight, Carli Antor, one of our interns, left the film room. No one else was in there until 6:45 in the morning when the film was found missing. I suggested that we get everyone together and figure out what happened. Since Tom had stayed since the end of his shift, we started with him. I asked if anything unusual had happened that night. He told me no. As always he made his rounds and was relieved at the end of his shift. The only people he had seen were the two assistant coaches and the intern. I asked if any of them might have taken the film. He said that he had no idea. Next we brought in Carli. She was looking a little nervous but still looked very nice for that early in the morning. I asked her what she was doing in the film room at midnight. “I was watching the film of the last practice to ensure that each player is doing what he is supposed to do with each new play. I have a checklist of each player and their assignments. I review all the new plays to make sure no last minute adjustments need to be made.” With that, she showed me the checklist on her clipboard. Just then, the day security guard walked by on his rounds, so I asked if we could talk with him. Mike introduced me to Rich Pender. Rich said that there was not much that he could say because the film was missing before he showed up for work at 7 am. Since Chuck had not yet gotten in, I asked to take a look at the security tape myself. As Mike had said, Chuck left soon after the tape started. I fast-forwarded through empty tape until I saw Carli leave the film room at 12:43. I noticed that she had on a very tight fitting outfit and was carrying nothing but her clipboard. I fast-forwarded to the end of the tape. As I expected, the digital timer in the corner clicked off the time in order until 7:00 am when the tape ended. Mike looked at me hopefully and asked if I needed to talk to the last two suspects. I told him that first I wanted to watch the tape again, so I rewound from 7 am back till Carli showed up at 12:43 am. I stopped the tape and was looking at Carli when Mike stuck his head in the room and said, “Two hours till game time. Let’s solve this later.” I told him no need to wait, I knew who did it.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What we know for certain\n   •  The night-shift security tape runs continuously from the start of Tom Barrett’s 8-hour shift until 7:00 a.m.  \n   •  The hallway that contains the film-room door is in full view of one of the three cameras. If anybody opened that door the lens would have caught it and the time-stamp (fed directly from the Internet) would have shown the moment.  \n   •  When the tape is replayed the time-stamp advances without a single break or jump from 11-ish p.m. to 7:00 a.m.  Therefore no chunk of tape was removed or overwritten; the recording is genuinely continuous.\n\n2.  The only people who appear on that tape in front of the film-room door\n   •  11:0x p.m. – Assistant coach Chuck Jarrett walks out of the room and leaves the corridor.  \n   •  12:43 a.m. – Intern Carli Antor walks out.  She is wearing an extremely tight outfit and is carrying only a clipboard.  \n   •  6:45 a.m. – A different assistant coach opens the door, discovers the film is gone and raises the alarm.\n\n3.  What those facts imply about opportunity\n   •  After 12:43 a.m. nobody—not a coach, not a player, not a security guard—so much as touched the door until 6:45 a.m.  \n   •  Consequently the film had to leave the room by 12:43 a.m. at the latest.  \n\n4.  Who was inside at 12:43 a.m.?\n   •  Only Carli Antor.  Chuck Jarrett had left more than an hour earlier, and Tom Barrett was seen only doing his rounds in the other hallways.\n\n5.  Could Tom Barrett have stolen the film and edited the tape?\n   •  For that to work he would have had to cut out the minutes that show him walking to the door, entering, leaving with the film, and then splice the recording so that the time-stamp still marched forward unbroken.  But the time-stamp on every frame is generated live from an Internet clock.  A seamless edit is impossible without sophisticated digital processing equipment the guard’s desk does not have, and the detective saw no jumps or repeats in the clock.  \n   •  Therefore Tom is ruled out.\n\n6.  Could Chuck Jarrett have taken the film before 11 p.m.?\n   •  Carli claims—and her story is plausible—that she spent the hours before 12:43 a.m. actually watching the practice tape and filling out the checklist she later displayed.  If Chuck had removed the film before 11 p.m. there would have been nothing for her to watch.  Her detailed, freshly filled-in checklist is inconsistent with that.  \n\n7.  The crucial visual clue\n   •  The detective rewound and froze the frame that shows Carli leaving.  She wears skin-tight clothes, so she has no place to hide a videotape on her person, yet she is carrying a single rigid object with a convenient hollow: a two-piece clipboard.  A modern DV cassette, an SD card, or even a USB drive holding today’s digital “film” fits easily between the metal clip and the back panel of a standard clipboard.  The “tight outfit” is mentioned only to emphasize that the clipboard is the only possible hiding place.\n\n8.  Motive\n   •  Carli is a low-level intern with access but very little salary.  She has the strongest incentive to make quick money by selling the Ravens’ game plan to their opponent—or to a gambler—without instantly ruining a long-term coaching career the way Chuck would.  Her nervousness supports that motive.\n\n9.  Conclusion\n   •  Carli Antor had both the opportunity (alone in the room, last person to touch the film) and an easy means to smuggle it out (inside her clipboard).  No one else could have removed it without appearing on the tape or causing a tell-tale gap in the recording.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCarli Antor, Tom Barrett, Chuck Jarrett, Rich Pender, (Unnamed assistant coach who discovered the loss)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCarli Antor\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate Saturday night the practice tape is already in the film room.  Before the night-shift security tape begins, Carli Antor enters to do her legitimate assignment of grading the walk-through.  While she works she decides (or has already planned) to steal the tape.  When she finishes at 12:43 a.m. she slips the small cassette/memory card into the cavity of her clipboard, walks calmly out of the room, and heads home.\n\nBecause she leaves before Tom Barrett’s rounds bring him back past that hallway and because the camera is always running, no one else approaches the door for the rest of the night.  The time-stamped video therefore shows an untouched corridor until 6:45 a.m., when an assistant coach enters, discovers the tape missing, and raises the alarm.\n\nWhen Buck reviews the tape, the absence of any gap in the time-code rules out tampering and therefore rules out Tom Barrett.  Chuck Jarrett is eliminated because Carli demonstrably watched the tape after he left.  The only person who could have carried it out, and the only object large enough to conceal it, is Carli with her clipboard.  Thus she is the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Tom Barrett – Any theft by him would have forced him to edit or interrupt the camera feed, which the unbroken, sequential time-stamp proves did not happen.  \n•  Chuck Jarrett – He left before the tape shows Carli spending more than an hour inside the room watching the film; therefore the film existed after he was gone.  \n•  Rich Pender – He did not come on duty until 7 a.m., after the loss was discovered.  \n•  The unnamed assistant coach – He is the person who first noticed the theft at 6:45 a.m.; the tape already shows the door unopened before that moment.  \nAll of them lacked either the opportunity (never near the door during the critical window) or any plausible way to remove the film unseen.  Only Carli Antor meets every necessary condition for the crime.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "First it was obvious that neither Chuck nor Rich could have taken the film. Carli watched the film in the film room after Chuck left so he could not have taken it. Rich did not come in until after the film was found missing. Carli could not have taken it. With a tight fitting outfit and nothing in her hands, there was no way she could have carried it out of the room without it being seen.\nTom on the other hand had plenty of time to steal the film with no one watching. After all, it is daylight saving time. The clocks got turned back an hour. All that he had to do was turn the recorder off exactly at 2:00 am for an hour and then turn it back on an hour later. He actually worked a 9-hour shift so he should have run out of tape on an 8 hour tape.\nMike and I approached Tom to ask him why he had taken the tape. It turns out that he was retiring the following week and just wanted a memento to remember his time with the team. There was no way he was going to give the film to the Browns.

Worried that he was going to tell me he could not get the tickets after all, I immediately called him back. “Buck”, he said, “we have a major problem and I need your help.” I was relieved, as it did not sound like I was going to lose my tickets, so I asked, “What seems to be the problem?” “Someone stole the film of the Ravens’ last practice. It is the walk through in which they verify all the new plays, defenses, etc. for today’s game. Everyone is convinced the Browns did it. We need to find out what happened and fast.” I told him that I would meet him at the team office in 20 minutes. Mike met me at the front door. After giving me a funny look for showing up at the Raven’s office in a Browns jersey, he quickly explained to me what happened. One of the assistant coaches went into the film room at 6:45 am to take one last look at the film and found that the film was gone. Mike was really upset that something like this could have happened. I told him to calm down and take me through what he knew. The film room is at the end of a hallway. That hallway and two other hallways are covered by a 24-hour video camera. There are three security shifts, with each guard working an 8-hour shift. At the beginning of each shift, they put in a new blank 8-hour tape and it records the three monitors simultaneously. When their shift is over, the new guard takes the old tape out, puts in a new tape and stores the previous tape in order. Each monitor has a date/time stamp on it. The date and time come in off of the Internet, so there is no way that anyone can alter the time shown on the tape. The only person who has access to the video recorder is the security guard who is on duty; last night, that was Tom Barrett. Mike said that they had watched the entire tape. Right at the beginning of the tape Chuck Jarrett, an assistant coach, was seen coming out of the film room. A little after midnight, Carli Antor, one of our interns, left the film room. No one else was in there until 6:45 in the morning when the film was found missing. I suggested that we get everyone together and figure out what happened. Since Tom had stayed since the end of his shift, we started with him. I asked if anything unusual had happened that night. He told me no. As always he made his rounds and was relieved at the end of his shift. The only people he had seen were the two assistant coaches and the intern. I asked if any of them might have taken the film. He said that he had no idea. Next we brought in Carli. She was looking a little nervous but still looked very nice for that early in the morning. I asked her what she was doing in the film room at midnight. “I was watching the film of the last practice to ensure that each player is doing what he is supposed to do with each new play. I have a checklist of each player and their assignments. I review all the new plays to make sure no last minute adjustments need to be made.” With that, she showed me the checklist on her clipboard. Just then, the day security guard walked by on his rounds, so I asked if we could talk with him. Mike introduced me to Rich Pender. Rich said that there was not much that he could say because the film was missing before he showed up for work at 7 am. Since Chuck had not yet gotten in, I asked to take a look at the security tape myself. As Mike had said, Chuck left soon after the tape started. I fast-forwarded through empty tape until I saw Carli leave the film room at 12:43. I noticed that she had on a very tight fitting outfit and was carrying nothing but her clipboard. I fast-forwarded to the end of the tape. As I expected, the digital timer in the corner clicked off the time in order until 7:00 am when the tape ended. Mike looked at me hopefully and asked if I needed to talk to the last two suspects. I told him that first I wanted to watch the tape again, so I rewound from 7 am back till Carli showed up at 12:43 am. I stopped the tape and was looking at Carli when Mike stuck his head in the room and said, “Two hours till game time. Let’s solve this later.” I told him no need to wait, I knew who did it.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Carli Antor; (b) Chuck Jarrett; (c) Rich Pender; (d) Tom Barrett",
      "answer": "(d) Tom Barrett",
      "outcome": "First it was obvious that neither Chuck nor Rich could have taken the film. Carli watched the film in the film room after Chuck left so he could not have taken it. Rich did not come in until after the film was found missing. Carli could not have taken it. With a tight fitting outfit and nothing in her hands, there was no way she could have carried it out of the room without it being seen.\nTom on the other hand had plenty of time to steal the film with no one watching. After all, it is daylight saving time. The clocks got turned back an hour. All that he had to do was turn the recorder off exactly at 2:00 am for an hour and then turn it back on an hour later. He actually worked a 9-hour shift so he should have run out of tape on an 8 hour tape.\nMike and I approached Tom to ask him why he had taken the tape. It turns out that he was retiring the following week and just wanted a memento to remember his time with the team. There was no way he was going to give the film to the Browns. It was now time to go watch a great game."
