    "full_text": "Eleanor Williams was as vain as she was rich, but also as kind-hearted as she was wealthy. She enjoyed giving frequent cocktail parties with close friends. So it was one Friday evening when she hosted a small group of friends in her luxurious downtown penthouse apartment. Eleanor was very observant and could be critical of her friends, but always kept these thoughts private. She tended to be domineering, but everyone who knew her well knew that this was simply a cover for her gentler disposition. This particular Friday evening would later become known within Eleanor’s circle as the Night of the Diamond Necklace. The initial act in the chain of events leading to her necklace’s disappearance was simple enough: at 5:20 p.m., as she held the necklace aloft to place it around her neck, the bedside telephone rang. It turned out to be a wrong number, but it caused her to forget she had left the necklace sitting on the top of the lavish, king-sized bed. Eleanor was a wealthy woman who often wore expensive jewelry, so it was not surprising that she became distracted and simply forgot about it. The Duncans arrived first, right at 5:30. Harold and Fiona were dressed casually. The outgoing Harold, a retired senior executive from one of Eleanor’s charitable organizations, wore a turtleneck sweater and blue blazer. He was one of Eleanor’s favorites and would stay close to her all evening. Fiona, quiet and unassuming, sported a simple and relatively inexpensive evening dress, but with a very tasteful matching purse and jacket. She also wore a pair of high heel shoes with the pointy heels that Eleanor detested, not only because she did not like the looks of them, but they tended to put deep indentations into the plush carpet which covered all of the floors in the elegant apartment, except the kitchen. Eleanor quietly wished that dinner parties could someday be truly formal again, but said nothing to her dear friends. She took Fiona’s jacket and purse to the hall closet, still not remembering the sparkling necklace lying on the bed, easily visible from the restroom and hall closet outside. Next to arrive was Colonel Barrow. Colonel Stephen Barrow was recently retired from the U.S. Air Force and still sported the deep suntan he had gained overseas on his last assignment. The colonel was noisy, gregarious, a bit clumsy, and capable of filling a room with simply his presence. Eleanor inwardly groaned when she saw him in his too-baggy suit with unfashionably large coat pockets and lapels. She determined to see the colonel again soon and buy him something more stylish. The poor man had been overseas too long. Eleanor took his coat and put it in the same closet with Fiona Duncan’s jacket. Last to arrive was Abby Grant, who rang the door chime as everyone else was in the middle of their first drink. Abby was an elderly widow who was heiress to the Grant paper fortune. Her father’s company made everything from nose tissue to cardboard boxes. If an item was made of paper or cardboard, Abby’s company was the sales leader in the industry, or close to it. She was very rich but also very eccentric. Tonight, she wore a skintight sleeveless evening gown, sported her own diamond necklace, and a pair of short, black velvet gloves. Abby wore no jacket so Eleanor, the perfect hostess, mixed Abby her favorite drink and served it herself. The group sat in the comfortable living room visiting over cocktails. Eleanor took her favorite chair, facing the kitchen with her back to the hall. During the cocktail period, Colonel Barrow excused himself from the group to visit the hall restroom, which sat just off of the living room entrance and next to the closet, and Fiona followed shortly thereafter to wash her hands. Harold excused himself for a moment to retrieve ice from the kitchen. When he returned, Eleanor invited everyone into the hallway. There they grouped together underneath a new painting Eleanor wanted to show off. Later, she would recall that during this time Abby had excused herself briefly to suppress a sneezing fit, but Eleanor couldn’t recall where she headed to get away from the group. Dinner was served at 6:15 by a longtime family caterer and friend, Maurice Eades. Maurice was no different from any of Eleanor’s friends. He loved the lady as family but his nerves were always put to the test when he was working for her, for Eleanor would never let him out of her keen sight when serving one of her dinners. He had considered asking her to find another caterer because of it, but had never had the heart to follow through. At dinner, Eleanor admired Abby’s necklace and realized she was not wearing her own. Vanity kept her from retrieving it, after she recalled leaving it on her bed. She did not wish to indicate to her friends that she had forgotten to finish dressing for the party. After a very pleasant evening, which ended around 9:30, Eleanor returned to her bedroom and found the necklace missing. Eleanor, failing a bit physically in her later years but still in possession of a razor sharp mind, looked over the bedroom carefully. Her diamond necklace was the only thing missing.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Eleanor left the necklace on the bed at 5:20 p.m.  The theft therefore had to occur between 5:20 and 6:15 (the moment Eleanor, still at table, realised she was not wearing it).\n\n2.  Who had a chance to be near the bedroom during that interval?\n    • Fiona Duncan – her jacket and purse were put in the hall closet that looks toward the bedroom, and she later “went to wash her hands,” entering the hall restroom directly beside the closet.  \n    • Colonel Barrow – used the same restroom just before Fiona.  \n    • Abby Grant – slipped away from the group for a moment while everyone was gathered in the hall under the new painting.  \n    • Harold Duncan – left the living-room only to fetch ice from the kitchen (the only room with tiled flooring, not carpet).  \n    • Maurice Eades – constantly under Eleanor’s eye while serving.\n\n3.  Physical evidence Eleanor would notice at 9:30:  \n    • All floors except the kitchen are covered with a thick, plush carpet.  \n    • Only one guest wore the kind of shoes whose stiletto-like heels “tended to put deep indentations into the plush carpet”—Fiona Duncan.  \n    • If someone in pointy heels had stepped from the bathroom doorway into the bedroom, those characteristic holes would still be in the carpet pile hours later; Eleanor, “in possession of a razor-sharp mind,” would see them at once.\n\n4.  Conclusion:  \n    • Fresh, sharply-defined stiletto marks leading toward (and back from) the bed could only have been made by Fiona, proving opportunity.  \n    • Fiona alone carried a purse large enough to hide the necklace conveniently; it was hanging in the closet right beside her route.  \n    • Motive is simple greed (or envy of Eleanor’s jewels); nothing in the story gives the others a comparable motive, and Fiona’s unobtrusive nature would make her the least suspected.\n\nTherefore Eleanor’s quick survey of the apartment would point straight at Fiona Duncan.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFiona Duncan, Harold Duncan, Colonel Stephen Barrow, Abby Grant, Maurice Eades\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nFiona Duncan\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• 5:20 p.m.  Eleanor lays the diamond necklace on the bed, is distracted by a phone call.  \n• 5:30 p.m.  The Duncans arrive.  Eleanor hangs Fiona’s jacket and purse in the hall closet; from that spot the necklace is visible on the bed.  Fiona notices it.  \n• About 5:45 p.m.  Colonel Barrow visits the hall restroom and returns.  \n• Immediately afterward Fiona “goes to wash her hands.”  Alone in the hallway, she steps into the closet, takes her purse, crosses the few paces into the bedroom, lifts the necklace, slips it into the purse, then returns it to the closet and rejoins the party.  Her stiletto heels leave the tell-tale punctures in the plush carpet.  \n• 6:15 p.m.  Dinner is served.  The necklace is already gone, but Eleanor does not yet check the bedroom.  \n• 9:30 p.m.  Party ends.  Guests collect their coats.  Fiona retrieves her purse, now containing the necklace, and leaves.  \n• Moments later Eleanor enters the bedroom, sees the necklace missing, and notices the fresh narrow heel marks in the carpet leading to and from the bed—marks that can belong to no one but Fiona Duncan.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Harold Duncan never left the living-room except to fetch ice from the kitchen, the only non-carpeted room—no chance to reach the bedroom unseen.  \n• Colonel Barrow did pass the bedroom, but his broad ordinary shoes would not produce the stiletto punctures Eleanor found; furthermore, Fiona entered the area after him, so even if the necklace had still been there, she could have taken it.  \n• Abby Grant slipped away briefly, yet she wore an elegant gown with no pockets and flat shoes; no corresponding carpet marks would match her footwear.  \n• Maurice Eades was under Eleanor’s constant supervision while serving and had no plausible moment to reach the bedroom without being noticed.  \nHence, all tangible evidence—and the only distinctive physical traces—point solely to Fiona Duncan.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
