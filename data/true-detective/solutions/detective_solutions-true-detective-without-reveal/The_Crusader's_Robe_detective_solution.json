    "full_text": "There was finally a smooth west wind that plumped the sails of our vessel and carried us beyond what the rowers could have done on their own. When the order came to stack oars, relief was felt beyond the galley itself. Regardless of what people say, it is a difficult thing to hear those cries and moans. And, I think, it rather takes away from our civilizing mission on these Crusades. Or, maybe I worry too much. Anyway, this journal will be safe from prying eyes. Except for Captain Fosters – he’s the only one on the crew who can read. I would doubt that many of the passengers had either the capacity or the interest to read -- certainly not Sir Francis Walters, the leader of this expedition! He prides himself on leaving that sort of thing to Morgan Grant, his clerk. I don’t like him much, I must confess. Imagine taking a first name! His clerk surely puts on airs. Only the quality needs that distinction, in this year of Our Lord 1204. After so many adventures, it was good to finally board a solid English ship once again, thanks to our expedition leader, Sir Francis Walters. He had sent mounted messengers, and arranged for us to be met at Zara along the coast, not far from our victory a year or two ago. Now at least it was safe for an English ship to sail in these waters. I wonder how long that will last. Some may say that our quest was a failure in any event, since we never got to Jerusalem, or anywhere near it. Others say we accomplished our purpose, which was the settling of accounts in Constantinople. Still, it is bothersome that we sacked the greatest city in Christendom, and left the heirs of Saladin alone! That Italian Doge, Enrico Dandolo, was responsible. He had enemies, and we needed his shipping. But I am getting ahead of myself. From Zara we had sailed due west, then taken in fresh supplies at Sicily, paid for with good English gold (taken from the treasury at Constantinople, I must admit). We rounded the sea-lanes past Gibraltar, and were now headed due north, towards England and home. It is odd to think that all of this happened just yesterday. We were taking back to England, for installation at Canterbury Cathedral, a precious and ancient robe, said by some to have been worn by saints of the early church, and called for that reason the Robe of the Saints. It was plain, without fancy embroidery of any sort. It was believed that this precious robe, wound around the body, could cure any wound. That was what made it different from the other robes, both plain and festooned with precious gems. These ornate robes had been taken as well, so that they could be better safeguarded in England, of course. When the chest was first placed on board, it was opened by Godefroi, a villein used for heavy work (requiring muscles and no brain). We all got a glimpse of the treasures contained therein. Each robe had a paper that gave its history and dignity. Those Byzantines were certainly scholarly, I’ll give them that. All of the robes were then replaced by Godefroi in their proper order, and stored in the one massive chest that was stowed in the ship’s hold, and watched over by Godefroi. In this case, he was supposed to frighten away any intruders who might be curious about the chest. He clearly failed in his task, and under the lash, gave the following information. His supper had been placed on the floor of the hold as usual, but his candle had guttered out, and he didn’t see who had served it. He smelled the food, relit his candle, and ate and drank. Shortly afterwards, he had fallen fast asleep. When he woke, some hours later, he felt drugged. He saw that the chains on the chest were unfastened, and fearing theft, he had summoned the guard. In the presence of Sir Francis Walters, Morgan Grant and myself, the chest was opened. Morgan Grant looked at each cloth robe that was in the chest, one by one. One robe was missing: the Robe of the Saints. We knew one thing, of course, that the Robe of the Saints was still on board ship. We had not docked since the theft. That information, however, did us precious little good, since the plain robe looked like any other ordinary robe, of which there were dozens on board. But the real one, of course, was of great value. Sir Francis asked me to look into the matter -- discreetly, of course. Smelling the mug, I could detect a peculiar odor, bitter and unpleasant. It smelled like that overpowering herb that the enemy uses to induce dreams and reduce pain when surgery is needed. I’ll say this for the enemy in the privacy of this journal - I’d rather be treated by one of their surgeons than by one of our own! Then all through today I discreetly, as requested, traced the movements of everyone on board, both the crew of 12 and the 41 passengers. The galley rowers I excluded, as they were locked into their galley room, even when not rowing. It would have taken a revolt for them to roam around the ship, and that had not happened. In the end, nearly everyone, including myself, had kept company at the time that Godefroi was given his supper. So everyone could prove, by someone else, his innocence. That included myself, I am relieved to note. Everyone except three people, that is: Captain Fosters, Sir Francis Walters and Morgan Grant. Captain Fosters told me that since it was a rocky sail in the early evening that he had stayed in his own cabin. “You have no idea how inconvenient it is to use a peg leg in a storm, m’boy, and I hope for your sake you never find out!” he said. Morgan Grant spent most of the evening in private prayer. A devout man, he confessed to me that he was terrified of stormy weather at sea, and he prayed that the ship would ride out the storm. Sir Francis looked at me with scorn, and with rum on his breath, said: “I got drunk, that’s what I did - that’s what anyone with a grain of sense would do in a storm at sea, you blockhead!” “That’s all right, Sir Francis,” I said. “I know who stole the Robe of the Saints. And I am sure that with persuasive methods, you will soon have it back where it belongs, with the other robes in the chest.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What had to be done to steal the Robe?\n   •  Enter the hold unseen.  \n   •  Send Godefroi to sleep quickly (the drugged food and drink).  \n   •  Pick out the Robe of the Saints from many almost identical, plain robes.  \n   •  Re-lock the chains.\n\n2.  Who could identify the right robe?\n   The only way to recognise it was by reading the paper label tied to it.  \n   The narrator makes a point of stressing literacy:\n        –  “except for Captain Fosters – he’s the only one on the crew who can read.”  \n        –  “Sir Francis… leaves that sort of thing to Morgan Grant, his clerk.”  \n   So, on the whole ship only three people are known to read: the narrator (our detective), Captain Fosters and Morgan Grant.  \n   Sir Francis Walters is specifically said NOT to read; therefore he could not choose the one plain robe he wanted.  \n   Godefroi and the rest of the crew/rowers are illiterate.\n\n   ⇒  The thief must be either Captain Fosters or Morgan Grant.\n\n3.  Opportunity / alibis\n   The detective’s enquiry shows that everyone aboard had an alibi for the relevant hour except\n        –  Captain Fosters  (says he stayed in his cabin because a peg-leg is useless in a rough sea)  \n        –  Morgan Grant     (claims he was alone in prayer)  \n        –  Sir Francis Walters (admits he was drinking alone)  \n\n4.  Eliminating Sir Francis Walters\n   Illiterate → could not identify the robe.  \n   Removing ALL the plain robes would have been the only course open to him, yet only one is missing.  \n   ⇒  Sir Francis cannot be the thief.\n\n5.  Captain Fosters or Morgan Grant?\n   a)  Stealth.  A peg-leg on wooden decks is noisy; Godefroi was still awake long enough to relight his candle and begin eating.  Even partly drugged he would have heard the thump of a wooden leg on the ladder and in the narrow hold. He reported nothing of the kind.  \n   b)  Physical ease.  Captain Fosters himself complains how awkward a peg-leg is “in a storm.”  The seas were rough enough for him to make that complaint, but not so rough that anyone else had difficulty moving about.  The hold ladder in a pitching ship is the last place a one-legged man chooses to visit.  \n   c)  Access to the soporific.  The bitter-smelling herb is the same used “by the enemy… to induce dreams and reduce pain.”  That is exactly the sort of exotic medical item a scholarly clerk who has catalogued Byzantine treasures might carry, not standard equipment for a ship’s captain.\n\n   ⇒  The practical and medical clues point away from Captain Fosters and towards Morgan Grant.\n\n6.  Behaviour at the opening of the chest\n   When the chest was opened, it was Morgan Grant who “looked at each cloth robe… one by one.”  \n   The thief naturally wants to be in charge of the inventory to make sure no one else notices anything incriminating (e.g., a missing label).  That tells against him, not for him.\n\nConclusion: Morgan Grant is the only person who  \n   • could READ the label,  \n   • could move easily and quietly to the hold,  \n   • plausibly possessed the drug,  \n   • had no witness to his whereabouts, and  \n   • acted suspiciously when the loss was discovered.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCaptain Fosters, Morgan Grant, Sir Francis Walters\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMorgan Grant\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFearing the robe would fetch a fortune—or wishing to keep its reputed healing power for himself—Morgan Grant decided to steal it during the first rough spell at sea, when most people stayed above-decks or in their cabins.\n\nEarlier in the day he obtained a pinch of the powerful sleep-inducing herb he had seen used in the East.  At supper-time he descended to the hold, carrying Godefroi’s food and drink.  In the darkness the guard could not see who delivered the tray.  The drugged wine put Godefroi to sleep within minutes.\n\nMorgan then unfastened the chains, opened the chest, and by reading the attached labels located the single plain “Robe of the Saints.”  He removed it, closed the chest, refastened the chains and returned to his berth, where he posed as a man at prayer for the rest of the evening.\n\nNext morning, summoned to witness the inspection, he handled each robe himself so that no one else would notice the missing tag or altered order.  He planned to hide the robe among his baggage until they reached England, then sell it—or perhaps present it to a great lord for patronage.\n\nHis plan failed once the narrator realised that only a literate man could have selected the correct garment and that a lumbering captain on a peg-leg would never have risked the ladders of the hold in a storm.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nCaptain Fosters  \n•  Although literate, he would have been heard approaching on his peg-leg; Godefroi heard nothing before he fell asleep.  \n•  He had no evident access to the Eastern narcotic.  \n•  His physical disability makes a clandestine descent to the hold in bad weather highly unlikely.\n\nSir Francis Walters  \n•  Illiterate—he could not distinguish the Robe of the Saints from any other plain robe.  \n•  If he had tried, he would have had to remove several robes, yet only one is missing.  \n•  His drunkenness is an unattractive habit but not evidence of theft.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

That included myself, I am relieved to note. Everyone except three people, that is: Captain Fosters, Sir Francis Walters and Morgan Grant. Captain Fosters told me that since it was a rocky sail in the early evening that he had stayed in his own cabin. “You have no idea how inconvenient it is to use a peg leg in a storm, m’boy, and I hope for your sake you never find out!” he said. Morgan Grant spent most of the evening in private prayer. A devout man, he confessed to me that he was terrified of stormy weather at sea, and he prayed that the ship would ride out the storm. Sir Francis looked at me with scorn, and with rum on his breath, said: “I got drunk, that’s what I did - that’s what anyone with a grain of sense would do in a storm at sea, you blockhead!” “That’s all right, Sir Francis,” I said. “I know who stole the Robe of the Saints. And I am sure that with persuasive methods, you will soon have it back where it belongs, with the other robes in the chest.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Captain Fosters; (b) Godefroi; (c) Morgan Grant; (d) Sir Francis Walters",
      "answer": "(b) Godefroi",
      "outcome": "Sir Francis Walters had spent the evening drinking, and was too drunk to steal the robe.\nMorgan Grant’s religious fervor makes him an unlikely thief of a holy object, and he would have been spotted getting Godefroi’s meal. Also, it would not have been possible for Captain Fosters, with his peg leg, to maneuver down to the hold in a storm with Godefroi’s supper.\nGodefroi staged the theft. Although illiterate, he had taken each robe from the chest in the first place and replaced them in the same order. He thus had memorized which robe was the actual Robe of the Saints. He had expected that it would fetch a high price, given the relics market in England at the time. Instead, his theft led him to the block."
