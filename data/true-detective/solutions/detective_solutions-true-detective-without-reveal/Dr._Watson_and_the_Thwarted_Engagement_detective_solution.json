    "full_text": "It was one of those nasty March days, full of winter bluster and cold early spring rain, and I was feeling out of sorts. Sherlock Holmes was, as far as I then knew, a victim of his tussle with Professor Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland. (You will note that this was before his reappearance as I, Dr. James Watson, have written elsewhere.) I was sadly going through the papers of his cases, hoping to recapture something of the spirit and excitement of his companionship during our days of working on his cases. Or rather, I should put it more modestly, and just say how thrilled I had been to work alongside Holmes, at his unfailing direction. Mrs. Hudson, the housekeeper at 221B Baker Street, had served me delicious hot tea with scones and jam, and I then settled in to reading some old files. A number of them were not yet chronicled, and perhaps I sought to make Holmes come alive for an hour or so while I wrote notes about a case that he and I had worked on together. That was when a knock on the door interrupted my thoughts, and before Mrs. Hudson could introduce the visitor, I saw a charming, rather breathless young woman, about twenty, fashionably dressed, almost bursting through the door, so hurried was she. “You must help me, Mr. Holmes!” She nearly shouted. I tried to set her right, I really did. But each time I opened my mouth, she began again, cutting off speech with her cries for urgent action. “You must come and help! Even now it might be too late,” she cried. In the end, not knowing what I was doing or where we were going, I grabbed my overcoat and, for the sake of the image, an old deerstalker cap that Holmes had abandoned on a hook near the door, rushed out the door with her, leaving an astonished Mrs. Hudson in our wake. “We’ll go to Euston Station, and I’ll explain everything on the train,” she said. And it was with a sense of relief that, good as her word, as soon as we were on the suburban train line, she took a deep breath, prepared to speak and then looked at me closely for the first time. “Odd, you don’t look anything like Sherlock Holmes,” she sputtered. “That’s because I am not Sherlock Holmes,” I said. “I am Dr. James Watson at your service. Holmes and I have explored many cases together, and in his unfortunate absence (for I was still unwilling, despite the evidence, to admit to myself that Holmes might be dead), I will be glad to assist you in any way that I can.” That seemed to comfort her. “Please begin,” I said. “My name is Sheila Ingalls,” she said. “I am the daughter of the Reverend Martin Ingalls of Camden Parish, our destination today. I thought that today was going to be the happiest day of my life, for the announcement of my engagement to Wallace Anders was to be announced this morning.” “I gather it was not announced?” “No. Imagine my feelings when I arrived at the church, following a short morning walk from the parsonage where my father and I reside, and looking at the bulletin board where announcements of intending marriage are posted, saw that Wallace Anders was not listed as engaged to be married to myself!” She then started to cry and pulled from her handbag an enormous handkerchief, which was soon put to strenuous use. “But that isn’t the end of it!” She said. “No?” “No, indeed!” For looking at the notice more closely, I saw that Wallace Anders was engaged to marry Georgette Pelham instead!” “This seems to be nothing more than clerical error,” I said, trying to calm the young woman. “Surely, there is a logical explanation for this mistake?” “If only it were that simple,” she wistfuly replied. Resisting my attempts to question her further, we rode in grim silence for the short distance of the commute to Camden Station, where we were met by her father, the Reverend Marvin Ingalls. He confirmed her story, and soon we were at the church, where I could see for myself what had been made public. Locked behind glass, the bulletin board displayed just one listing, Georgette Pelham to marry Wallace Anders. “Who makes these listings and posts them?” I asked the Reverend Ingalls. “In the absence of a clerk, I do,” he said. “It doesn’t help that I don’t see all that well. The procedure is that a donation is usually given, and then I open the bulletin board box with a key, pin the notice, and then lock the box once again.” “Does anyone else have another key that opens the notice board?” “No. This is the only one, from my office.” He waggled it like a badge of office, which perhaps in a way it was, in that small parish community. “Come to think of it,” he added, “I have a duplicate key at home, in the parsonage.” “When did all this happen?” “It was late last night. Wallace Anders came to the parish office and asked to post the engagement. He was generous, and so I gave him the notice paper to fill out, which he did.” “Did you look at the paper before posting it?” “Only a glance, for I must confess, my eyes are not what they were.” “But that wasn’t your only caller yesterday?” That was a nice note, I thought. Holmes could hardly have done better himself, in anticipating a line of inquiry. “No. Georgette Pelham also came, half an hour later. She came to see the announcement, she said.” “She didn’t want to make an announcement herself?” “That isn’t possible. Only men are permitted to make the announcements, either the prospective bridegroom, or the father of the bride.” “And you had made no announcement?” “None whatever.” “Was Georgette Pelham emotionally distressed?” “No, she was not upset in the least - she seemed quite happy. And that rather surprised me.” “Why, Reverend Ingalls?” “Well, it has long been known in this little town that she wanted to marry Wallace Anders - most people assumed that they would be married one day.” I turned to Sheila Ingalls. “When did Wallace Anders propose?” “It was one week ago. We were playing whist, and he was in a playful mood. I had just played a very skillful hand, if I do say so myself. He said that anyone who played that well should be his partner for life!” “Really?” “Yes, indeed, and everyone heard it. I assented and told Father immediately, of course. And then I said that Wallace should post the engagement. He was somewhat reluctant, saying that his business wasn’t quite self-sufficient, some nonsense of that sort. And finally, last night he told me that he would be posting the engagement announcement which I could not wait to see this morning. And we have this forgery instead!” “Can you help us, Dr. Watson?” “I believe that I can. You did well, Miss Ingalls, to bring it to my personal attention. For I can tell you not only who posted the announcement, but what was the intention in doing so.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe parish notice-board is kept locked.  \nOnly the Reverend’s two identical keys (one kept in the church office, the other in the parsonage) will open it.  \nNo one has broken the glass, so whatever paper is in the case was put there with one of those keys.\n\nThe Reverend tells us that late last night Wallace Anders came to the office, paid the customary donation, filled in the form and handed it back.  \nBecause of his weak eyesight the clergyman merely “glanced” at it and, supposing it to bear Sheila’s name, pinned it up and locked the case.\n\nHalf an hour later Miss Georgette Pelham called “to see the announcement”.  When she read the paper she was “quite happy”, a reaction that startled the Reverend, for he naturally believed the paper to proclaim Wallace’s engagement to Sheila, which ought to have distressed Georgette, not delighted her.\n\nThis single circumstance already tells us that the paper on the board at that moment named Georgette, not Sheila.\n\nWho, then, could have written Georgette’s name?  \n•  Not the Reverend: he never read the document.  \n•  Not Georgette: only a man (the bridegroom or the bride’s father) is permitted to file the notice, and the Reverend distinctly recognised his caller as Wallace.  \n•  Not Sheila: she was never at the church that night.  \n•  Only Wallace himself filled in the form.\n\nMotive.  One week earlier Wallace had made a light-hearted remark at cards – “anyone who played that well should be my partner for life!” – which Sheila instantly treated as a solemn proposal.  Wallace tried to stall (“my business is not yet self-sufficient”) but at length promised to file the banns.  In reality he had long been expected to marry Georgette, the girl he truly wanted.  By writing Georgette’s name on the form he both honoured the rule that only the bridegroom posts the notice and rid himself, in one stroke, of an unwanted obligation to Sheila.\n\nOpportunity.  Wallace had both the physical presence in the office and the ONLY moment when the locked case stood open.  He needed no key afterwards; the Reverend obligingly locked the notice in for him.\n\nEvidence.  – Wallace’s personal visit  \n           – His handwriting on the form (which can be verified)  \n           – Georgette’s satisfied reaction minutes later\n\nLogical deduction: since Wallace was the only person who wrote on the form, and since the form inside the locked case now bears Georgette’s name, Wallace must have written it so.  The “forgery” exists only in Sheila’s mind; the paper is perfectly genuine, merely not the engagement she imagined.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nWallace Anders, Georgette Pelham, Reverend Martin Ingalls, Sheila Ingalls\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nWallace Anders\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nGeorgette Pelham (moral accomplice – she clearly knew in advance, but took no active part in filing the notice)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. For some time Wallace Anders and Georgette Pelham have understood that they will marry.\n2. During a whist party Wallace’s playful compliment is seized upon by Sheila Ingalls as a formal proposal.  Out of politeness or weakness Wallace does not contradict her at once.\n3. Pressed by Sheila to post the engagement, Wallace finally agrees, intending all along to announce his marriage to Georgette instead.\n4. Late the previous night he visits the parish office.  The near-sighted Reverend Ingalls hands him the blank notice form, watches him fill it in, accepts a donation, and—without properly reading the names—pins it inside the notice-board and locks the glass door.\n5. Wallace leaves and immediately tips off Georgette.  Half an hour later she arrives “to see the announcement”, reads her own name beside Wallace’s and departs in high spirits.\n6. Next morning Sheila rushes to the church expecting to find her own engagement proclaimed and is stunned to read Georgette’s.  Believing it a malign trick, she hurries to 221B Baker Street for help.\n7. Dr. Watson, on hearing the simple facts, realises that no one but Wallace could have written Georgette’s name, and that the notice, therefore, states Wallace’s true intention.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nReverend Martin Ingalls – He merely carried out the mechanical act of pinning up the paper supplied by Wallace.  His defective eyesight prevented him from noticing whose name was written.\n\nSheila Ingalls – She never handled the notice or the keys and is in fact the deceived party.\n\nGeorgette Pelham – She neither wrote nor posted the notice; she was only a delighted observer once Wallace had done so.  Apart from moral encouragement, she took no action that night.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "As Dr. Watson immediately noticed, Sheila Ingalls is a headstrong young woman who makes unwarranted assumptions - first, that he was Sherlock Holmes! She wanted to marry Wallace Anders, and believed mistakenly that his flattering statement when they were playing cards was really a proposal of marriage. Instead, after a week in which it became clear that Sheila wanted to marry him and had talked herself into believing they were engaged, Anders went ahead and posted the marriage plans with his longtime sweetheart, Georgette Pelham. The Reverend Ingalls had poor eyesight, so he assumed the posting was for his daughter. Georgette’s happy frame of mind was caused by the fact that she saw that Wallace had kept his promise to her, by posting their engagement. Sheila would have had no motive to take the key that was kept at the parsonage and put up the announcement that was posted as she believed that it was going to announce her engagement.\nThat only left Anders, who did offer a sincere apology to Sheila and her father. “But it was the only way that things could turn out right,” he said.",

The procedure is that a donation is usually given, and then I open the bulletin board box with a key, pin the notice, and then lock the box once again.” “Does anyone else have another key that opens the notice board?” “No. This is the only one, from my office.” He waggled it like a badge of office, which perhaps in a way it was, in that small parish community. “Come to think of it,” he added, “I have a duplicate key at home, in the parsonage.” “When did all this happen?” “It was late last night. Wallace Anders came to the parish office and asked to post the engagement. He was generous, and so I gave him the notice paper to fill out, which he did.” “Did you look at the paper before posting it?” “Only a glance, for I must confess, my eyes are not what they were.” “But that wasn’t your only caller yesterday?” That was a nice note, I thought. Holmes could hardly have done better himself, in anticipating a line of inquiry. “No. Georgette Pelham also came, half an hour later. She came to see the announcement, she said.” “She didn’t want to make an announcement herself?” “That isn’t possible. Only men are permitted to make the announcements, either the prospective bridegroom, or the father of the bride.” “And you had made no announcement?” “None whatever.” “Was Georgette Pelham emotionally distressed?” “No, she was not upset in the least - she seemed quite happy. And that rather surprised me.” “Why, Reverend Ingalls?” “Well, it has long been known in this little town that she wanted to marry Wallace Anders - most people assumed that they would be married one day.” I turned to Sheila Ingalls. “When did Wallace Anders propose?” “It was one week ago. We were playing whist, and he was in a playful mood. I had just played a very skillful hand, if I do say so myself. He said that anyone who played that well should be his partner for life!” “Really?” “Yes, indeed, and everyone heard it. I assented and told Father immediately, of course. And then I said that Wallace should post the engagement. He was somewhat reluctant, saying that his business wasn’t quite self-sufficient, some nonsense of that sort. And finally, last night he told me that he would be posting the engagement announcement which I could not wait to see this morning. And we have this forgery instead!” “Can you help us, Dr. Watson?” “I believe that I can. You did well, Miss Ingalls, to bring it to my personal attention. For I can tell you not only who posted the announcement, but what was the intention in doing so.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Georgette Pelham; (b) Reverend Marvin Ingalls; (c) Sheila Ingalls; (d) Wallace Anders",
      "answer": "(d) Wallace Anders",
      "outcome": "As Dr. Watson immediately noticed, Sheila Ingalls is a headstrong young woman who makes unwarranted assumptions - first, that he was Sherlock Holmes! She wanted to marry Wallace Anders, and believed mistakenly that his flattering statement when they were playing cards was really a proposal of marriage. Instead, after a week in which it became clear that Sheila wanted to marry him and had talked herself into believing they were engaged, Anders went ahead and posted the marriage plans with his longtime sweetheart, Georgette Pelham. The Reverend Ingalls had poor eyesight, so he assumed the posting was for his daughter. Georgette’s happy frame of mind was caused by the fact that she saw that Wallace had kept his promise to her, by posting their engagement. Sheila would have had no motive to take the key that was kept at the parsonage and put up the announcement that was posted as she believed that it was going to announce her engagement.\nThat only left Anders, who did offer a sincere apology to Sheila and her father. “But it was the only way that things could turn out right,” he said."
