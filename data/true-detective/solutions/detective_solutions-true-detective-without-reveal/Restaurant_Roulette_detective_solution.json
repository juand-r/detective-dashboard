    "full_text": "One night when his little nephew and niece were too excited to sleep, Uncle Robert told them a story about a past adventure he’d encountered on the police force. He hoped that a mystery might tire them out enough to send them off to sleep. And so he gathered the children around the fire and began this story. “Back when I was a detective I once found myself in a very strange situation. We had arrested a spy in central London and knew that he was on his way to a restaurant where he would be passed a small microchip containing a lot of information via a contact masquerading as a chef.” “What do you mean, Uncle Robert?” his small nephew, Peter, asked. “A spy was to receive a special microchip from a chef. … A chef, that is, who was not really a chef. “Who was he then?” “He was a secret contact.” “Oh, a secret contact! Hmm, was he one of the good guys or one of the bad guys?” his nephew inquired. “He was one of the bad guys … working with the spy.” “Stop interrupting, and let him tell the story!” little Jane said, pointing at Peter. Uncle Robert smiled, continuing: “We knew the description that the chef had been given, and we also knew that the spy was to receive the microchip concealed in a dish ordered from the menu. It turned out that the spy’s description commented on a few physical particulars, all of which I happened to match. Since we knew the table number booked in the spy’s name, it occurred to us that I should go along to the restaurant, assuming the identity of the spy – and intercept the microchip!” “Why didn’t you just go in and arrest everyone?” Peter asked. “Well, we would have,” Uncle Robert replied, “but there was a chance that the contact would have destroyed the chip! And without the chip, there would have been no way to prove anything.” “Exactly! I could have guessed that!” Jane chimed in. “What happened in the restaurant, Uncle Robert? Tell us, tell us!” Peter said anxiously, fidgeting with his pajama sleeves. “Well, I made my way to the restaurant, which was a fancy place in Mayfair called, Foie Paux. This place had vibrant and bright décor. And in the center of the large, main room was a square enclosure where four chefs were preparing their specialty dishes. As I watched, a smartly dressed waitress cleared up the used round of red plates from the central serving area, while a waiter deposited a fresh stack of blue dishes.” “I would prefer the blue dishes if I ate there,” Billy said. Jane rolled her eyes, and crinkled her small forehead, annoyed with her little brother. She nodded at Uncle Robert, insisting that he continue. “I was surprised to find that the table had not been booked for a specific time. The spy had only stated that he would turn up at some point during the evening, and that he wished to occupy the table for 30 minutes. Thankfully, before my cover was blown, the head waiter relayed these details to me as soon as I gave my name, which I spoke loud enough for the chefs at the central table to overhear.” Jane and Peter, wide-eyed, stared up at Uncle Robert in anticipation. “As I took my seat in the restaurant, I began to feel very nervous. The first part of my mission had now been achieved: I was successfully impersonating our captured spy. But I knew that if I ordered the wrong dish, I would immediately give myself away and put my own life in danger.” “Oh no!” Peter gasped. “As I told you earlier, one of the chefs was the contact. But he wouldn’t risk making any sign to me, so I had to try and figure out which dish I was supposed to order. I was wearing the captured spy’s clothes, and before entering the restaurant I had gone through his wallet to see if it contained some clues. All I had found was an old bus ticket, a locker key and a card thanking the bearer for his donation to a charity called Vegetarian Way.” “What does vegetarian mean? Peter inquired. “Vegetarian’s don’t eat meat,” Jane answered. “That’s right, Jane. … Now, there were four dishes available that evening, each prepared by a different chef. Gianni Girodano was making Italian-style vegetable lasagna. Atsushi Nishi was preparing Japanese yakisoba noodles. Jean-Pierre Dubois was making French onion soup and Jack McDonald had prepared a traditional haggis and trimmings. Trying to act casual, I talked to my waiter about the dishes to see if I could uncover any clue to help me decide which to order.” “He said: ‘I recommend the delicious French onion soup, sir. It has been very popular this evening.’ To which I repied: ‘Do you serve the same dishes all day?’” “What did he say then?” Peter interrupted. “He replied: ‘No, sir, there is a lunch menu and a dinner menu … but sometimes if a dish is popular at lunch, we keep the chef engaged to make another session for the evening customers. This is the case with the French onion soup today.’” “I love French onion soup,” Peter added. “Well, I’ll have to make you some soon. But back to the mystery, Peter. … The Italian chef seemed very popular. He was flirting with the female customers seated nearest to the serving area as he sprinkled fresh basil across a row of lasagna’s all lined up in blue dishes, capped at the end by one in a red dish.” “Did the waiter provide more clues?” Jane asked “Yes, he did.” As I watched the restaurant, the Japanese chef tossed ingredients high into the air, catching them in his frying pan. The waiter followed my gaze and nodded in approval. The waiter said: ‘Atsushi is preparing yakisoba stir fry noodles and watching him work is a real treat. He is quite the showman, and we’re lucky to have him here as part of his world tour. In fact, this is the sixth restaurant he has cooked in today, and I believe he will have one more session before he is finished for the night.’” Uncle Robert stopped his story, and looked closely at Peter and Jane. “So, children,” said Uncle Robert, “who can tell me which chef was the contact spy?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive – Only one of the four chefs has any reason to co-operate with the captured spy: the one who is supposed to hand over the micro-chip.  \n2. What would the chef have to do?  \n   • Prepare a dish that the spy would certainly order.  \n   • Make sure the dish can be recognised quickly (by the chef) so it is not served to an ordinary customer by mistake.  \n3. What would the spy order?  \n   • The contents of the spy’s wallet give the biggest clue: a donor card for the charity “Vegetarian Way”.  A person who carries such a card is almost certainly a vegetarian.  \n   • Of the four specials only the Vegetable Lasagna is definitely meat-free.  \n     – Onion soup is usually made with beef stock.  \n     – Yakisoba almost always contains pork or seafood.  \n     – Haggis is obviously meat.  \n   • So the genuine spy would have ordered the Vegetable Lasagna.  \n4. How could the chef avoid handing the chip to the wrong customer?  \n   • At the start of the story a waitress removes a pile of red plates and a waiter brings in an entire new stack of blue ones – so, from that moment on, every diner in the restaurant should be served on blue crockery.  \n   • Yet, while Gianni Girodano is lining up his lasagnas “all in blue dishes” he deliberately finishes the row with a single lasagna “in a red dish”.  \n   • Since no other red plate is now in circulation, that one red plate is a secret beacon: “This is the portion for the spy.”  \n5. Opportunity / physical evidence  \n   • Gianni is in sole charge of the lasagna and is the only person still in possession of a red plate.  \n   • He could hide a micro-chip safely inside a slice of lasagna without it being noticed and without damaging it.  \n   • None of the other chefs does anything that singles out a particular serving; nor do their dishes fit a vegetarian.  \n6. Logical deduction – the only chef whose dish (a) matches the spy’s dietary preference and (b) is uniquely marked so the chip cannot be lost is the Italian, Gianni Girodano.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGianni Girodano, Atsushi Nishi, Jean-Pierre Dubois, Jack McDonald\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nGianni Girodano\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nThe enemy spy arranged to pick up a data-laden micro-chip from a contact masquerading as a chef at Foie Paux.  \nKnowing the spy was a strict vegetarian, the contact, Chef Gianni Girodano, elected to hide the chip inside his Vegetable Lasagna, the only unquestionably meat-free item on the evening menu.  \n\nTo ensure the correct portion went to the spy and to no one else, Gianni kept back a single red plate while all other red plates were removed and replaced by blue ones. When the head waiter announced the name under which the table had been booked, Gianni began plating lasagna for the customers – all on blue crockery – but placed the micro-chip portion on the one remaining red plate at the end of the row. At the appropriate moment he intended to send that single red-plated lasagna to the spy’s table.\n\nUncle Robert saw the tell-tale red dish, realised which chef must be the contact, ordered the vegetable lasagna, and (once the evidence was safely in hand) moved in to make the arrest.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Atsushi Nishi (Japanese chef): his yakisoba almost certainly contains meat or seafood, so a known vegetarian would not have ordered it. He marked no special serving and had no distinctive plate.  \n• Jean-Pierre Dubois (French chef): onion soup is traditionally made with beef stock – unsuitable for a strict vegetarian. There is no sign he singled out a particular bowl.  \n• Jack McDonald (Scottish chef): haggis is meat; that alone rules him out. No unusual plating or behaviour points to him.  \n\nNone of these three chefs possessed the unique red plate that would safely identify the spy’s serving. Only Gianni Girodano satisfied all of the required conditions, so he – and he alone – is the contact who intended to pass over the micro-chip.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

So if it hadn’t been popular, he wouldn’t have been there at night. It was just down to chance that he was there.”\n“You’re right, Peter. But what about the Japanese chef?”\n“The Japanese chef was going from place to place and only cooking for a short time. Since the spy only booked a table for 30 minutes, but didn’t know exactly when that time would be, it’s likely he would have missed that chef and never had a chance to order the noodles.”\n“So who was it then?” Jane, the eldest child, asked sleepily.\n“The Italian of course,” Peter replied, “he was using the blue dishes to prepare lasagnas in, but he’d kept one back from an earlier made round, in a red dish! And he must have put the chip in that when he made it.”\n“Well, I’m glad that Peter is so clever,” Jane said as she pushed back her Uncle’s old police helmet, which kept falling down over her eyes.\nAs the children started to nod off after the excitement, Uncle Robert left the room with a smile and went to tell their mother that the little ones were ready for bed.",

      "outcome": "The children all thought for a while until their frowns of concentration began to be replaced by sleepy blinks.\n“What do you think?” Uncle Robert asked Peter who was deeply wrapped up in thought.\n“Well,” Peter said, “someone who would donate to a vegetarian society would probably not want to eat haggis, so I don’t think the spy would have arranged to have that dish brought to him.”\n“He wouldn’t have had to eat it,” said Jane.\n“He’d still not like that it was made from animals,” Peter insisted.\n“Go on, Peter,” Uncle Robert said with a smile.\n“The chef who made the French onion soup was only there because his soup sold so well at lunch. So if it hadn’t been popular, he wouldn’t have been there at night. It was just down to chance that he was there.”\n“You’re right, Peter. But what about the Japanese chef?”\n“The Japanese chef was going from place to place and only cooking for a short time. Since the spy only booked a table for 30 minutes, but didn’t know exactly when that time would be, it’s likely he would have missed that chef and never had a chance to order the noodles.”\n“So who was it then?” Jane, the eldest child, asked sleepily.\n“The Italian of course,” Peter replied, “he was using the blue dishes to prepare lasagnas in, but he’d kept one back from an earlier made round, in a red dish! And he must have put the chip in that when he made it.”\n“Well, I’m glad that Peter is so clever,” Jane said as she pushed back her Uncle’s old police helmet, which kept falling down over her eyes.\nAs the children started to nod off after the excitement, Uncle Robert left the room with a smile and went to tell their mother that the little ones were ready for bed."
