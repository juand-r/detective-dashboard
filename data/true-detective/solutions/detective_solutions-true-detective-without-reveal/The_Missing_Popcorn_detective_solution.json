    "full_text": "Specialist Fourth Class (SP/4) Tom White had been in country for 10 months in February, 1970 and looked forward to rotating back to CONUS (the military’s term for Continental United States) in April. Tom, a U.S. Army combat engineer, had been through many experiences in those 10 months. In addition to the constant threat of Viet Cong guerillas and the capable and dangerous North Vietnamese Army, he had survived a serious bout of amoebic dysentery and a nasty case of ringworm, as well as the filthy living conditions and lack of sleep, which most field enlisted men suffered. Tom was tired and run down, but had weathered the worst that Vietnam had to offer. One afternoon in late February, a box from his uncle arrived in company headquarters. In it, Tom found a large can of commercially packaged multi-flavored popcorn. He was delighted with the unexpected gift. He looked forward to eating the popcorn, but first, he had to go upstairs for guard duty. The guard tower was on top of the semi-underground bunker his squad lived in, or hooch, as such quarters were called. The hooch sat right up on the perimeter of the base camp with the concertina fence barely 10 feet away from the half buried rear wall. Guard duty was split into two-hour shifts, beginning at 1900 hours (7:00 p.m.) and ending at 0700 hours (7:00 a.m.). Tonight, Tom was on from 1900 until 2100 hours. Guard duty on this night was uneventful. From high in the guard tower, he could see everything in front of him and everything in back on his side of the base camp. During his shift, he saw Henson head out toward the NCO club on the other side of the compound. Henson had with him only the sidearm pistol he was allowed as a non-commissioned officer. Mac walked towards the recreation area, carrying a duffel bag of baseballs and bats used during pickup games. Locke, the last to leave, walked away from the squad’s area with his M-16 rifle, but Tom could not tell where he went. He lost sight of him when a rice farmer and his water buffalo got too close to the wire directly below him. Tom’s relief arrived right at 2100 and Tom climbed down the ladder he had helped build several months before to enter the hooch. The tropical sun was just going down and he thought about how hot it could be in Vietnam at any time of day — even as late as midnight. But Tom’s focus turned quickly to the memory of the popcorn his Uncle Ross had sent. He planned to munch on it while writing a letter home. Entering the hooch and walking to his bunk, Tom noticed the can of popcorn missing. He also noticed water on the floor. There were a few kernels of the cheese flavored scattered in the aisle. The hooch was unusually clean as there were no empty soft drink or beer cans lying around. He also saw his buddies, Mosier, Henson, Macnamara and Locke, huddled close to his bunk with sheepish expressions on their faces. He thought it odd that they were back in the hooch on a hot evening at 2100. Annoyed, he asked, “Come on! What have you guys done with my popcorn?” Locke, the newest member of the squad, said simply, “I haven’t seen it.” Macnamara answered calmly, “Last I saw it, it was by your bunk.” Henson, Tom’s best friend, said nothing. And Mosier looked down at his feet, avoiding eye contact with Tom altogether. These fellows were all good friends and had been through a lot together. Tom did not believe they had been mean-spirited in taking his popcorn. One or all of them had given into the temptation of the moment, and had taken the opportunity to enjoy some stateside snack food. Tom White couldn’t blame them, and so, he was not angry. However, he did want to know the truth. The guys were being coy with him, and he realized this was now a game they were playing. “OK, guys. If I figure this out, will the guilty one admit it?” They men all grinned and agreed. Henson, with beer on his breath, belched, “Tom, it was only one of us that took your popcorn. He’s already been dressed down and will return what is left of it with an apology – after you figure out which of us took it, that is.” Tom, smirking, began thinking out loud, “OK, then. I brought the package down here from the mail office just before evening chow. Then we all went to chow before I headed directly up to the guard tower. So, one of you took it while I was on guard duty.” “So far, so good,” Macnamara replied. “OK, Mac, what did you do after chow?” “… Wrote a letter home, and then went to play ball with B squad.” “Locke, how about you?” “I went to the other side of the camp to watch the movie.” There was always an outdoor movie, at night, down by the enlisted men’s and NCO clubs. Tom White did not think late night movies were a wise idea, and he was proven right a few weeks earlier when the Viet Cong zeroed in on the movie screen after dark, and dropped a dozen mortars into the assembled audience. Tom though it odd that Locke took his M-16 with him to the movie, but knew that, as the newest member of the squad, he was still nervous about being in a war zone. He said nothing about seeing him with his rifle. Instead, he asked, “What did you see? Locke replied, Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell. White looked the new man over. He knew that Gina Lollobrigida starred in that film and was one of the G.I.’s favorites. He looked over to his good buddy Henson. “Ron, how about you?” Ron answered, “I had a couple of beers down at the club.” Tom nodded, and turned to Dicky, “Mosier, what’s your story?” “I went to the showers. I washed my clothes.” Tom replied, “That’s it?” Mosier answered, “That’s it.” Tom looked at his guilty buddy. He smiled and the guilty buddy did, too. He asked modestly, “Well … did you eat it all?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who had a motive?\n   Everybody likes Stateside snack-food, so any of the four could have been tempted.  \n   Motive therefore does not distinguish anyone.\n\n2. Who had the opportunity?\n   • 19:00–21:00 was the two-hour period that Tom was in the tower.  \n   • From the tower Tom actually SAW three of the men leave the squad area:\n        – Henson headed for the NCO club.\n        – Macnamara walked off, carrying a duffel of baseball gear.\n        – Locke, “the last to leave”, walked away with his M-16.\n     (Tom lost sight of Locke only after Locke was already moving away.)\n   • If those three were seen departing, only one man was not seen leaving: Mosier.\n     Either Mosier never left the hooch or he left before Tom climbed the tower, but\n     in either case he was the only one unquestionably ALONE with the popcorn.\n\n3. Physical evidence in the hooch\n   • A puddle of water and an “unusually clean” floor.  \n     Mosier claims he “went to the showers” and “washed [his] clothes”.\n     Bringing dripping laundry back would account for the water and the tidied-up floor.\n     If Mosier had really washed at the distant showers, Tom would have noticed him\n     leaving or returning – but he did not.\n   • Scattered cheese-flavoured kernels.\n     Whoever opened the tin must have done so right there in the hooch; kernels\n     would not be lying in the aisle if the tin had been carried away unopened.\n\n4. Truthfulness of the alibis\n   • Henson’s story fits what Tom saw; Henson was drinking at the club, not in the hooch\n     (there were no beer cans in the hooch).\n   • Mac’s story matches what Tom saw; he went to play ball.\n   • Locke’s story also matches what Tom saw (movie on the far side of camp).\n   • Mosier’s story does NOT match the evidence: Tom never saw him leave, yet puddled\n     water and a clean floor show he had been in the hooch, not at the showers.\n\n5. How Tom identifies the culprit\n   When Tom mentally ticks off what he himself witnessed, Mosier is the only man\n   whose movements are unaccounted for.  Tom looks straight at him; Mosier smiles\n   back – the classic “You got me” reaction.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRon Henson, Frank Macnamara (“Mac”), Bill Locke, Dicky Mosier\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nDicky Mosier\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nJust after evening chow, Tom carried the big tin of popcorn into the hooch and\nwent up to the guard tower for his 19:00–21:00 shift.  \nAlmost immediately the others drifted off: Henson to the NCO club, Macnamara to\npickup baseball, and Locke (nervously carrying his rifle) toward the nightly\nmovie.  Mosier stayed behind intending to wash his clothes.  Working alone in\nthe heat he grew hungry, opened Tom’s popcorn tin and began eating the cheese\nsection, spilling a few kernels.  Realising he had been caught red-handed if\nTom came down and saw the mess, he tidied the hooch and threw away the usual\nbeer and soda cans.  His wet laundry left water on the floor.  When the other\nthree returned around 21:00 they found Mosier finishing off the popcorn, gave\nhim a good-natured “dressing-down” and agreed to make a game of it for Tom.\nWhen Tom confronted them, a quick check of what he had observed from the tower\ntold him that Mosier was the only one who could possibly have taken the snack,\nand Mosier’s sheepish smile confirmed it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nRon Henson – Tom personally saw him leave for the NCO club; no beer cans were\nin the hooch, so he had no reason to return there while Tom was on watch.\n\nFrank “Mac” Macnamara – Tom saw him head straight toward the recreation area\nwith a full duffel of bats and balls; a loaded duffel would have been an awkward\nplace to hide a popcorn tin, and Mac would have had no time to come back and\neat it before the game.\n\nBill Locke – Tom saw Locke, the “last to leave”, walk away.  For Locke to be\nguilty he would have had to sneak back unseen past a man in a tower who could\nsee “everything” on that side of camp, which is highly improbable.\n\nOnly Dicky Mosier’s movements were never observed; the puddle of water and\nunusually neat hooch corroborate that he stayed inside washing clothes – and\nmunching Tom White’s popcorn.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He said nothing about seeing him with his rifle. Instead, he asked, “What did you see? Locke replied, Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell. White looked the new man over. He knew that Gina Lollobrigida starred in that film and was one of the G.I.’s favorites. He looked over to his good buddy Henson. “Ron, how about you?” Ron answered, “I had a couple of beers down at the club.” Tom nodded, and turned to Dicky, “Mosier, what’s your story?” “I went to the showers. I washed my clothes.” Tom replied, “That’s it?” Mosier answered, “That’s it.” Tom looked at his guilty buddy. He smiled and the guilty buddy did, too. He asked modestly, “Well … did you eat it all?”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Private First Class Dicky Mosier; (b) Private Joe Locke; (c) Specialist Fifth Class Ron Henson; (d) Specialist Fourth Class Patrick Macnamara",
      "answer": "(b) Private Joe Locke",
      "outcome": "“How did you know it was me?”\nTom was still chuckling. “Well, I know it wasn’t Mac. The recreation area is easily visible from the tower and I saw him walk over there with the balls and bats.”\nTom paused a moment before continuing. “I also know it wasn’t Henson. I can smell the beer on his breath from here!”\nBy now, Tom was chuckling but he continued his discourse. “Mosier did exactly what he said he did. He took a shower and washed his clothes. He must have just returned when I came down from guard. There was still water on the floor when I came in. No doubt they dripped some before he hung them outside the porthole to dry.”\nLocke said, sheepishly, “Yeah, you got me. The empty can is in back of the hooch with Mosier’s clothes. I’m sorry, man. I’ll make it up to you. I would like to know how you figured it out.”\nTom liked Locke. He had been in country only a month but he was a square guy and his promotion to PFC was expected anytime. He said to him, “You lied about the movie.”\nLocke said, “But Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell IS on tonight!”\nTom slapped Locke playfully on the shoulder and said, “Yeah, I know, but it should be just starting. You cannot watch outdoor films until it’s dark outside.”"
