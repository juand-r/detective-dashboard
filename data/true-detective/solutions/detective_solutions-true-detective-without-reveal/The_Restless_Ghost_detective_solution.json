    "full_text": "Ernestine “Mama” McCormick was one day shy of her 100th birthday. Tomorrow, Michael, Connie and her two grandchildren would celebrate. But, that was tomorrow. Now, she had other things on her mind. It was a few minutes before midnight and the familiar sounds coming from the downstairs den were especially loud. Ernestine was a strong, spiritual person and she felt the presence of her deceased husband’s spirit within the large house. She was convinced that it was Mike who visited the den every night after she retired to her bed. Hidden within a false wall in their home were rare and valuable gold coins -- coins that Mike had obtained in Africa shortly after the war. Mike had cherished the coins, and Ernestine sensed, or thought she sensed, that Mike was struggling to obtain them. She feared setting the coins out for him, lest he leave with them and not return. How a ghost would do this, she did not know. But his absence was something she dreaded. Every morning, Ernestine would survey the den. Sometimes, she could tell the room had been disturbed. Ernestine would not allow the maid to dust the den for this reason. One morning she had noticed the dust collecting on the gas cutoff feeding the fireplace. Near it, several magazines on the large coffee table had been strewn about the richly finished wood floor. Ernestine suspected the cause to be strong drafts drawn by the huge fireplace – or was it indeed Mike’s ghost thrashing about in frustration? Ernestine kept the “gas key,” which was the key to the disguised den wall safe, hanging on the wall upstairs. She learned long ago that Mike’s spirit would not come upstairs – or anywhere near her. Ernestine took the presence of Mike’s spirit seriously. The family mansion, which had been constructed in the late 1950s, still had the old-fashioned light switches it was originally built with. She kept these because of the loud click they made when flipped on or off. As far as she could recall, she had never heard a light switch go on or off in the middle of the night. She also refused to change the arrangement of furniture or the placement of pictures on the mansion’s many walls. In her mind, if it was Mike, she wanted him to feel at home. But nearing 100, Ernestine knew her senses could not be all that trustworthy. She asked herself often: Is Mike truly with me, or is it an old lady’s wishful thinking? All of this ran through Ernestine’s mind as she lay silently in bed. The next day, Michael and Connie were the first to arrive in the middle of the morning. Their children, Casey and Ellen, arrived early in the afternoon. The McCormick family was not just any family. The late Mike McCormick, Sr. was the founder of McCormick Plastics and had made his fortune in the years following World War II, when the nation’s appetite for all things plastic became insatiable. McCormick Plastics was a multi-billion dollar global corporation, and had been since the early 1960s. McCormick had offices and factories all over the world. Michael, Jr. and his brothers held key posts with the corporation. By the middle of the afternoon, Mama Ernestine, as she was called, was holding court in the dining room. A light lunch was being catered and she was up for the occasion. She was in excellent health physically and had lost none of her formidable mental faculties. As the family sat around the table, she silently took stock of those she loved dearly. Sadly, she reflected that her 65-year-old son, Michael, appeared to be in poor health. Michael was at least 40 pounds overweight and in the early stages of emphysema, caused by many years of smoking. He was chronically nearsighted and wore glasses so thick the lenses appeared to be coke bottle bottoms. As if reading his mother’s mind, he said, “I can see OK with the glasses, but cannot see well in the dark anymore, even with them on. I don’t know what we would do without our driver.” Ernestine smiled and kept her concerns to herself. She asked daughter-in-law, Connie, how she was doing. Connie had suffered polio in the 1950s epidemic and one leg was shorter than the other. She walked unevenly and with the help of a cane an elevated shoe. Connie replied, “I’m getting along OK, but the doc tells me to wear hard soled and heeled shoes at all times to avoid bone spurs.” Connie laughed, “This big shoe feels like a bowling ball sometimes but I’m not complaining. At least I can get around.” Ernestine nodded. Connie’s ability to laugh at herself was something she admired very much. She turned to Casey, her 36-year-old grandson. Casey was the free spirit in the family and it showed today. Casey had arrived at the McCormick house wearing a tank top, baggy military fatigue trousers and heavy soled boots. He had a small plastic bag with a change of socks and underwear. That was all he brought with him. Ernestine teased him, “Are you a Rambo wannabe?” The good natured Casey grinned back at her and said, “I suppose so.” Next, Ernestine surveyed Ellen. Ellen was 29 and an accomplished ballet dancer. Ernestine figured there was no way she could weigh more than 90 pounds. Ernestine considered that she would have made an excellent spy or cat burglar. She was able to appear and disappear unnoticed, so graceful and quiet were her body movements. She asked Ellen, “How is the dancing going?” “It’s going great, Mama. I’ve been able to raise several thousand dollars for the McCormick Foundation since last time I saw you.” Ernestine was fiercely proud of her granddaughter. She motioned for her to come closer. She kissed Ellen on the cheek and said, “Dear, I’m so proud of you! Keep up the good work.” The family had a wonderful visit over the late lunch. A light dinner and birthday cake would be enjoyed later. Before retiring for an afternoon nap, Ernestine decided it was time to tell them of her suspicions concerning their grandfather’s ghost. “Now, all of you will think this is the rambling of an old lady. Maybe it is, but hear me out. You’ve heard me speak of your grandfather’s African coins. We even showed them to you once when you younger ones were kids. Well, they are not in a safety deposit box like we told you – they are in a hidden safe in the den. The keyhole for the fireplace gas valve in the den is really the lock to the safe. That’s where the coins are. Several times a week … most nights, really, I hear noises down there, as if your grandfather is trying to get to the safe. Everyone was polite enough not to scoff at Mama Ernestine’s story. That night, they enjoyed Mama’s party. Everyone was in bed by 11:00 p.m. Sure enough, around 2:00 a.m., Ernestine heard noises in the night, only this time they were different. She heard the faint creaking of a door and felt the quiet and steady -- but heavy -- footsteps on the hardwood floors. She thought she heard the clicking of metal on metal downstairs. Ernestine didn’t know what to think and did not sleep the remainder of the night. In the morning, upon inspection of the den and wall safe, her fears were confirmed. Sitting on the sofa and pondering the situation for a few minutes, she realized what had happened: Someone had stolen the gold coins. With great agitation, she called the family together before breakfast. She held her temper long enough to explain what happened and, showing them the empty wall safe, said, “I know who did this.” Pointing to the guilty person, she said, heatedly, “Shame on you! Why did you do this?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  The burglar had to take the key from the upstairs hallway, go back downstairs, open the disguised lock, empty the safe and return to bed – all between about 2:00 and 2:30 a.m.\n\n2.  While Ernestine was awake she heard:\n        • A single door creak upstairs\n        • Footsteps that were “quiet and steady – but heavy”\n        • A soft “metal-on-metal” clicking downstairs (the key and the safe)\n\n3.  She did NOT hear the loud snap of any of the old-fashioned light switches.  \n    Whoever prowled about had to be able to move in almost total darkness.\n\n4.  Compare the four relatives who spent the night:\n\n    Michael McCormick  \n        – 65, badly overweight, early emphysema, extremely near-sighted.  \n        – Says openly that he “cannot see well in the dark anymore, even with\n          the glasses on.”  \n        – Could not have crossed the house twice in darkness without turning on lights.\n\n    Connie McCormick  \n        – Walks with an elevated shoe, a cane and an uneven gait.  \n        – A late-night walk would have produced the unmistakable cane tap and an\n          irregular rhythm, not the “steady” tread Ernestine felt.\n\n    Ellen McCormick  \n        – Only 90 lb and a trained ballerina.  \n        – Her footfalls would be light, almost impossible to feel through the\n          hardwood.  The steps Ernestine sensed were “heavy.”\n\n    Casey McCormick  \n        – 36, healthy, army-style temperament.  \n        – Arrived in thick, lug-soled combat boots and brought practically\n          nothing with him except a small plastic bag – exactly the sort of\n          bag that could carry a handful of gold coins.  \n        – As a child he had been shown the coins; the key still hung in the same\n          place it always had, so he knew where to find it.  \n        – Heavy boots striking hardwood can be felt as “heavy” footfalls even if\n          the wearer walks very softly – hence “quiet and steady – but heavy.”  \n        – Young, healthy eyes can negotiate a familiar house in darkness; no\n          light switch was needed.\n\n5.  In the morning Ernestine also had a visible confirmation.  Dust had been\n    building up on the den floor and on the hearth.  A single fresh set of\n    deep-tread prints, matching Casey’s boots (the same boots she had teased\n    him about the previous afternoon), led straight to the fireplace valve and\n    back.  No cane marks, no slipper prints, no light ballerina smudges – just\n    boot prints.\n\n6.  Motive: Casey is the family “free spirit,” evidently short of money\n    (arrives with only a change of socks and underwear).  A pouch of rare\n    African gold coins would solve that problem very nicely.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMichael McCormick, Connie McCormick, Casey McCormick, Ellen McCormick\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCasey McCormick\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly after everyone retired, Casey stayed awake.  Around 2 a.m. he put his\ncombat boots back on, slipped from his guest room and went upstairs.  The\nonly noise Ernestine heard up there was the soft creak of the hallway cabinet\ndoor as he took down the brass “gas key.”  Relying on his good night vision\nhe kept all lights off.\n\nMoving as lightly as his heavy boots allowed, he descended to the den.  He\ninserted the key into the fake fireplace shut-off, turned it, swung the\npanel open and transferred the small leather pouch of African gold coins to\nthe plastic bag he had brought for the purpose.  The faint “metal-on-metal”\nsound that reached Ernestine’s ears was the tumbler mechanism releasing.\n\nHe closed the panel, rehung the key exactly where it had been, and went\nquietly back to bed.  By morning the safe was empty and Casey planned to\nleave with his meagre luggage—now containing a fortune in coins.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMichael: Needs light to move around; Ernestine would have heard at least one\ndistinct switch click if he had left his room.  Moreover, his emphysema and\nweight make silently climbing and descending stairs improbable.\n\nConnie: Her uneven gait and the tapping of her cane would have made\nirregular, easily recognisable noises – not the even, “steady” tread Ernestine\nperceived.\n\nEllen: At 90 lb and a ballet dancer, her steps would have been almost\ninaudible and certainly not “heavy.”  She also wore soft shoes, so no boot-\ntread prints would have appeared in the hearth dust.\n\nTherefore only Casey fits every physical clue, had a clear motive and an\nobvious means of carrying the coins away – the small plastic bag he brought\nwith him and nothing else.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

    "reveal_text": "The family members were not quite certain whom she was pointing her shaking finger at. As if reading their minds, she said, “I’m sensing that your grandfather is with us.”\nEllen respectfully asked, “Do you really believe that Papa McCormick took the coins?”\nErnestine controlled her fury for the sake of her favorite granddaughter. She took a few deep breaths and began to speak, “No, I don’t, dear, but I know who did. She asked, “Casey, why in the world did you steal your grandfather’s coins?”\nCasey asked, feebly, “What makes you think I have them?”\nErnestine answered, “I may be old but I notice things. Last night, I heard footsteps, doors opening and a faint metallic sound. This morning I checked and, sure enough, somebody took the key and opened the safe in the middle of the night.”\nPatiently, Casey asked again, “So, why do you think I did it”\nQuietly, Ernestine answered, “It’s simple, really. Your father cannot see in the dark. I know that whoever was moving around in the night did not turn on any lights because I did not hear any switches being flipped. It wasn’t your mother because she would have had too much difficulty and made too much noise, especially going downstairs in the dark. Your sister would be just the opposite. She is too quiet and graceful to have done it. If she wanted to sneak around this house, nobody would have heard anything. Now Casey, you had a situation where luck met opportunity.”\nEvenly, Casey replied, “OK, it was me, but I wasn’t stealing them, Mama.” Wryly, he said, “You and Papa Mike have made sure we do not need to steal anything from anybody. I simply wished to have them cleaned and presented to you as a surprise.”\nErnestine believed him and her attitude softened. Casey saw this and playfully asked, “What makes you think it was not Papa’s ghost?”\nErnestine took a deep breath. Sadly, she said, “I don’t know if I really believe in ghosts.” Sighing, she added, “I simply don’t know. It’s just so comforting to think he is here with me.” Mama paused for a moment to think about what she was saying, and then continued, “Besides, even if he were here, he doesn’t come upstairs. You have to have the key to open the safe.” Ernestine paused once again before adding, “Sweetie, what gave you away was that you just made a little bit too much noise for it to be Papa’s ghost. … That and your heavy footsteps in those army boots.”\nEveryone laughed at this. Grinning, Casey said, “Everyone come upstairs and I will give Mama back the coins. They are on my bed. I was going to stuff them in my pockets just before leaving.” Casey paused, and then asked, “Would you like for me to have them cleaned? I realize now I should have asked.”\nSmiling now, Mama replied, “No, but thanks for the thought. I prefer to leave things the way Papa left them.”\nUpon arriving in Casey’s bedroom, they all saw that there were no coins on the bed. Instead, an old business card of Mike’s was found on Casey’s pillow -- one that Ernestine had not seen in many years. Casey looked ill but Ernestine knew exactly what happened and all doubts concerning her husband’s spirit were erased. Excitedly, she said, “Mike’s been here. He came up and got them when we were all downstairs. I believe he will be at peace now, but I hope he will stay around.”\nJust then, a gentle gust of cool, refreshing air swept into the room. They all felt it. Mama said, with emotion wracking her ancient voice, “Yes, he’s still here. He’s broken his rule to remain upstairs to be near us.”",

      "mystery_text": "Ernestine “Mama” McCormick was one day shy of her 100th birthday. Tomorrow, Michael, Connie and her two grandchildren would celebrate. But, that was tomorrow. Now, she had other things on her mind. It was a few minutes before midnight and the familiar sounds coming from the downstairs den were especially loud. Ernestine was a strong, spiritual person and she felt the presence of her deceased husband’s spirit within the large house. She was convinced that it was Mike who visited the den every night after she retired to her bed. Hidden within a false wall in their home were rare and valuable gold coins -- coins that Mike had obtained in Africa shortly after the war. Mike had cherished the coins, and Ernestine sensed, or thought she sensed, that Mike was struggling to obtain them. She feared setting the coins out for him, lest he leave with them and not return. How a ghost would do this, she did not know. But his absence was something she dreaded. Every morning, Ernestine would survey the den. Sometimes, she could tell the room had been disturbed. Ernestine would not allow the maid to dust the den for this reason. One morning she had noticed the dust collecting on the gas cutoff feeding the fireplace. Near it, several magazines on the large coffee table had been strewn about the richly finished wood floor. Ernestine suspected the cause to be strong drafts drawn by the huge fireplace – or was it indeed Mike’s ghost thrashing about in frustration? Ernestine kept the “gas key,” which was the key to the disguised den wall safe, hanging on the wall upstairs. She learned long ago that Mike’s spirit would not come upstairs – or anywhere near her. Ernestine took the presence of Mike’s spirit seriously. The family mansion, which had been constructed in the late 1950s, still had the old-fashioned light switches it was originally built with. She kept these because of the loud click they made when flipped on or off. As far as she could recall, she had never heard a light switch go on or off in the middle of the night. She also refused to change the arrangement of furniture or the placement of pictures on the mansion’s many walls. In her mind, if it was Mike, she wanted him to feel at home. But nearing 100, Ernestine knew her senses could not be all that trustworthy. She asked herself often: Is Mike truly with me, or is it an old lady’s wishful thinking? All of this ran through Ernestine’s mind as she lay silently in bed. The next day, Michael and Connie were the first to arrive in the middle of the morning. Their children, Casey and Ellen, arrived early in the afternoon. The McCormick family was not just any family. The late Mike McCormick, Sr. was the founder of McCormick Plastics and had made his fortune in the years following World War II, when the nation’s appetite for all things plastic became insatiable. McCormick Plastics was a multi-billion dollar global corporation, and had been since the early 1960s. McCormick had offices and factories all over the world. Michael, Jr. and his brothers held key posts with the corporation. By the middle of the afternoon, Mama Ernestine, as she was called, was holding court in the dining room. A light lunch was being catered and she was up for the occasion. She was in excellent health physically and had lost none of her formidable mental faculties. As the family sat around the table, she silently took stock of those she loved dearly. Sadly, she reflected that her 65-year-old son, Michael, appeared to be in poor health. Michael was at least 40 pounds overweight and in the early stages of emphysema, caused by many years of smoking. He was chronically nearsighted and wore glasses so thick the lenses appeared to be coke bottle bottoms. As if reading his mother’s mind, he said, “I can see OK with the glasses, but cannot see well in the dark anymore, even with them on. I don’t know what we would do without our driver.” Ernestine smiled and kept her concerns to herself. She asked daughter-in-law, Connie, how she was doing. Connie had suffered polio in the 1950s epidemic and one leg was shorter than the other. She walked unevenly and with the help of a cane an elevated shoe. Connie replied, “I’m getting along OK, but the doc tells me to wear hard soled and heeled shoes at all times to avoid bone spurs.” Connie laughed, “This big shoe feels like a bowling ball sometimes but I’m not complaining. At least I can get around.” Ernestine nodded. Connie’s ability to laugh at herself was something she admired very much. She turned to Casey, her 36-year-old grandson. Casey was the free spirit in the family and it showed today. Casey had arrived at the McCormick house wearing a tank top, baggy military fatigue trousers and heavy soled boots. He had a small plastic bag with a change of socks and underwear. That was all he brought with him. Ernestine teased him, “Are you a Rambo wannabe?” The good natured Casey grinned back at her and said, “I suppose so.” Next, Ernestine surveyed Ellen. Ellen was 29 and an accomplished ballet dancer. Ernestine figured there was no way she could weigh more than 90 pounds. Ernestine considered that she would have made an excellent spy or cat burglar. She was able to appear and disappear unnoticed, so graceful and quiet were her body movements. She asked Ellen, “How is the dancing going?” “It’s going great, Mama. I’ve been able to raise several thousand dollars for the McCormick Foundation since last time I saw you.” Ernestine was fiercely proud of her granddaughter. She motioned for her to come closer. She kissed Ellen on the cheek and said, “Dear, I’m so proud of you! Keep up the good work.” The family had a wonderful visit over the late lunch. A light dinner and birthday cake would be enjoyed later. Before retiring for an afternoon nap, Ernestine decided it was time to tell them of her suspicions concerning their grandfather’s ghost. “Now, all of you will think this is the rambling of an old lady. Maybe it is, but hear me out. You’ve heard me speak of your grandfather’s African coins. We even showed them to you once when you younger ones were kids. Well, they are not in a safety deposit box like we told you – they are in a hidden safe in the den. The keyhole for the fireplace gas valve in the den is really the lock to the safe. That’s where the coins are. Several times a week … most nights, really, I hear noises down there, as if your grandfather is trying to get to the safe. Everyone was polite enough not to scoff at Mama Ernestine’s story. That night, they enjoyed Mama’s party. Everyone was in bed by 11:00 p.m. Sure enough, around 2:00 a.m., Ernestine heard noises in the night, only this time they were different. She heard the faint creaking of a door and felt the quiet and steady -- but heavy -- footsteps on the hardwood floors. She thought she heard the clicking of metal on metal downstairs. Ernestine didn’t know what to think and did not sleep the remainder of the night. In the morning, upon inspection of the den and wall safe, her fears were confirmed. Sitting on the sofa and pondering the situation for a few minutes, she realized what had happened: Someone had stolen the gold coins. With great agitation, she called the family together before breakfast. She held her temper long enough to explain what happened and, showing them the empty wall safe, said, “I know who did this.” Pointing to the guilty person, she said, heatedly, “Shame on you! Why did you do this?”",

      "outcome": "The family members were not quite certain whom she was pointing her shaking finger at. As if reading their minds, she said, “I’m sensing that your grandfather is with us.”\nEllen respectfully asked, “Do you really believe that Papa McCormick took the coins?”\nErnestine controlled her fury for the sake of her favorite granddaughter. She took a few deep breaths and began to speak, “No, I don’t, dear, but I know who did. She asked, “Casey, why in the world did you steal your grandfather’s coins?”\nCasey asked, feebly, “What makes you think I have them?”\nErnestine answered, “I may be old but I notice things. Last night, I heard footsteps, doors opening and a faint metallic sound. This morning I checked and, sure enough, somebody took the key and opened the safe in the middle of the night.”\nPatiently, Casey asked again, “So, why do you think I did it”\nQuietly, Ernestine answered, “It’s simple, really. Your father cannot see in the dark. I know that whoever was moving around in the night did not turn on any lights because I did not hear any switches being flipped. It wasn’t your mother because she would have had too much difficulty and made too much noise, especially going downstairs in the dark. Your sister would be just the opposite. She is too quiet and graceful to have done it. If she wanted to sneak around this house, nobody would have heard anything. Now Casey, you had a situation where luck met opportunity.”\nEvenly, Casey replied, “OK, it was me, but I wasn’t stealing them, Mama.” Wryly, he said, “You and Papa Mike have made sure we do not need to steal anything from anybody. I simply wished to have them cleaned and presented to you as a surprise.”\nErnestine believed him and her attitude softened. Casey saw this and playfully asked, “What makes you think it was not Papa’s ghost?”\nErnestine took a deep breath. Sadly, she said, “I don’t know if I really believe in ghosts.” Sighing, she added, “I simply don’t know. It’s just so comforting to think he is here with me.” Mama paused for a moment to think about what she was saying, and then continued, “Besides, even if he were here, he doesn’t come upstairs. You have to have the key to open the safe.” Ernestine paused once again before adding, “Sweetie, what gave you away was that you just made a little bit too much noise for it to be Papa’s ghost. … That and your heavy footsteps in those army boots.”\nEveryone laughed at this. Grinning, Casey said, “Everyone come upstairs and I will give Mama back the coins. They are on my bed. I was going to stuff them in my pockets just before leaving.” Casey paused, and then asked, “Would you like for me to have them cleaned? I realize now I should have asked.”\nSmiling now, Mama replied, “No, but thanks for the thought. I prefer to leave things the way Papa left them.”\nUpon arriving in Casey’s bedroom, they all saw that there were no coins on the bed.

He came up and got them when we were all downstairs. I believe he will be at peace now, but I hope he will stay around.”\nJust then, a gentle gust of cool, refreshing air swept into the room.
