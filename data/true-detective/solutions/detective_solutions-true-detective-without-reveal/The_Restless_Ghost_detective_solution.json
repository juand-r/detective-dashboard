    "full_text": "Ernestine “Mama” McCormick was one day shy of her 100th birthday. Tomorrow, Michael, Connie and her two grandchildren would celebrate. But, that was tomorrow. Now, she had other things on her mind. It was a few minutes before midnight and the familiar sounds coming from the downstairs den were especially loud. Ernestine was a strong, spiritual person and she felt the presence of her deceased husband’s spirit within the large house. She was convinced that it was Mike who visited the den every night after she retired to her bed. Hidden within a false wall in their home were rare and valuable gold coins -- coins that Mike had obtained in Africa shortly after the war. Mike had cherished the coins, and Ernestine sensed, or thought she sensed, that Mike was struggling to obtain them. She feared setting the coins out for him, lest he leave with them and not return. How a ghost would do this, she did not know. But his absence was something she dreaded. Every morning, Ernestine would survey the den. Sometimes, she could tell the room had been disturbed. Ernestine would not allow the maid to dust the den for this reason. One morning she had noticed the dust collecting on the gas cutoff feeding the fireplace. Near it, several magazines on the large coffee table had been strewn about the richly finished wood floor. Ernestine suspected the cause to be strong drafts drawn by the huge fireplace – or was it indeed Mike’s ghost thrashing about in frustration? Ernestine kept the “gas key,” which was the key to the disguised den wall safe, hanging on the wall upstairs. She learned long ago that Mike’s spirit would not come upstairs – or anywhere near her. Ernestine took the presence of Mike’s spirit seriously. The family mansion, which had been constructed in the late 1950s, still had the old-fashioned light switches it was originally built with. She kept these because of the loud click they made when flipped on or off. As far as she could recall, she had never heard a light switch go on or off in the middle of the night. She also refused to change the arrangement of furniture or the placement of pictures on the mansion’s many walls. In her mind, if it was Mike, she wanted him to feel at home. But nearing 100, Ernestine knew her senses could not be all that trustworthy. She asked herself often: Is Mike truly with me, or is it an old lady’s wishful thinking? All of this ran through Ernestine’s mind as she lay silently in bed. The next day, Michael and Connie were the first to arrive in the middle of the morning. Their children, Casey and Ellen, arrived early in the afternoon. The McCormick family was not just any family. The late Mike McCormick, Sr. was the founder of McCormick Plastics and had made his fortune in the years following World War II, when the nation’s appetite for all things plastic became insatiable. McCormick Plastics was a multi-billion dollar global corporation, and had been since the early 1960s. McCormick had offices and factories all over the world. Michael, Jr. and his brothers held key posts with the corporation. By the middle of the afternoon, Mama Ernestine, as she was called, was holding court in the dining room. A light lunch was being catered and she was up for the occasion. She was in excellent health physically and had lost none of her formidable mental faculties. As the family sat around the table, she silently took stock of those she loved dearly. Sadly, she reflected that her 65-year-old son, Michael, appeared to be in poor health. Michael was at least 40 pounds overweight and in the early stages of emphysema, caused by many years of smoking. He was chronically nearsighted and wore glasses so thick the lenses appeared to be coke bottle bottoms. As if reading his mother’s mind, he said, “I can see OK with the glasses, but cannot see well in the dark anymore, even with them on. I don’t know what we would do without our driver.” Ernestine smiled and kept her concerns to herself. She asked daughter-in-law, Connie, how she was doing. Connie had suffered polio in the 1950s epidemic and one leg was shorter than the other. She walked unevenly and with the help of a cane an elevated shoe. Connie replied, “I’m getting along OK, but the doc tells me to wear hard soled and heeled shoes at all times to avoid bone spurs.” Connie laughed, “This big shoe feels like a bowling ball sometimes but I’m not complaining. At least I can get around.” Ernestine nodded. Connie’s ability to laugh at herself was something she admired very much. She turned to Casey, her 36-year-old grandson. Casey was the free spirit in the family and it showed today. Casey had arrived at the McCormick house wearing a tank top, baggy military fatigue trousers and heavy soled boots. He had a small plastic bag with a change of socks and underwear. That was all he brought with him. Ernestine teased him, “Are you a Rambo wannabe?” The good natured Casey grinned back at her and said, “I suppose so.” Next, Ernestine surveyed Ellen. Ellen was 29 and an accomplished ballet dancer. Ernestine figured there was no way she could weigh more than 90 pounds. Ernestine considered that she would have made an excellent spy or cat burglar. She was able to appear and disappear unnoticed, so graceful and quiet were her body movements. She asked Ellen, “How is the dancing going?” “It’s going great, Mama. I’ve been able to raise several thousand dollars for the McCormick Foundation since last time I saw you.” Ernestine was fiercely proud of her granddaughter. She motioned for her to come closer. She kissed Ellen on the cheek and said, “Dear, I’m so proud of you! Keep up the good work.” The family had a wonderful visit over the late lunch. A light dinner and birthday cake would be enjoyed later. Before retiring for an afternoon nap, Ernestine decided it was time to tell them of her suspicions concerning their grandfather’s ghost. “Now, all of you will think this is the rambling of an old lady. Maybe it is, but hear me out. You’ve heard me speak of your grandfather’s African coins. We even showed them to you once when you younger ones were kids. Well, they are not in a safety deposit box like we told you – they are in a hidden safe in the den. The keyhole for the fireplace gas valve in the den is really the lock to the safe. That’s where the coins are. Several times a week … most nights, really, I hear noises down there, as if your grandfather is trying to get to the safe. Everyone was polite enough not to scoff at Mama Ernestine’s story. That night, they enjoyed Mama’s party. Everyone was in bed by 11:00 p.m. Sure enough, around 2:00 a.m., Ernestine heard noises in the night, only this time they were different. She heard the faint creaking of a door and felt the quiet and steady -- but heavy -- footsteps on the hardwood floors. She thought she heard the clicking of metal on metal downstairs. Ernestine didn’t know what to think and did not sleep the remainder of the night. In the morning, upon inspection of the den and wall safe, her fears were confirmed. Sitting on the sofa and pondering the situation for a few minutes, she realized what had happened: Someone had stolen the gold coins. With great agitation, she called the family together before breakfast. She held her temper long enough to explain what happened and, showing them the empty wall safe, said, “I know who did this.” Pointing to the guilty person, she said, heatedly, “Shame on you! Why did you do this?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  WHO COULD MOVE AROUND IN THE DARK?\n   •  Mama did not hear a single light-switch click in the night.  \n      Therefore the thief worked in total darkness.  \n   •  Michael himself had just finished saying that, even with his “coke-bottle” glasses,  \n      he “cannot see well in the dark anymore.”  He would have had to turn on lights –  \n      and Mama would have heard the loud 1950-style switch.  So Michael is ruled out.  \n   •  Connie walks with an uneven gait and a cane.  Even trying to be quiet, she would\n      make an irregular thump-tap sound and the metal tip of the cane would drum on the\n      floor.  Mama heard none of that – she sensed “quiet and steady” steps.  Connie is\n      ruled out.  \n   •  Ellen is a 90-pound ballerina whose movements are described as almost noiseless.\n      Mama “felt … heavy footsteps.”  Ellen could not make the floorboards vibrate that\n      way.  \n   •  Casey owns and was wearing “heavy-soled boots.”  Even walking cautiously those\n      boots would press hard enough on the old hardwood floors for a sleeper upstairs\n      to feel the thuds without necessarily hearing loud clacks.\n\n2.  WHOSE FOOTSTEPS FIT WHAT MAMA FELT?\n   •  She “felt the quiet and steady – but heavy – footsteps.”  \n      •  Steady  → no limp, no cane  → not Connie.  \n      •  Heavy   → not the 90-lb Ellen.  \n      •  Quiet   → someone trying to be stealthy, not clumsy Michael.  \n      •  Heavy boots on hardwood match Casey exactly.\n\n3.  THE METAL-ON-METAL CLICKING\n   •  Mama “thought she heard the clicking of metal on metal.”  \n      The safe is opened by putting the fireplace ‘gas key’ (a metal bar) into the\n      disguised keyhole – exactly a metal-on-metal sound.  \n      That noise would be made only by the person actually operating the lock,\n      reinforcing that the person whose steps she felt is the thief.\n\n4.  MOTIVE\n   •  Casey arrived with nothing but a plastic bag containing socks and underwear –\n      not what a multi-million-dollar heir normally packs for a visit.  \n      Of the group he is the one who lives the roving, cash-poor “free-spirit” life.\n      The rare gold pieces would be an irresistible and portable fortune.\n\n5.  CONCLUSION\n   •  Only one person matches every physical clue (heavy but stealthy steps, no limp,\n      able to work in darkness, likely motive) – Casey McCormick.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMichael McCormick Jr., Connie McCormick, Casey McCormick, Ellen McCormick\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCasey McCormick\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly after 2:00 a.m., Casey pulled on the same heavy, lug-soled boots he had worn all\nday.  He slipped out of his bedroom and padded upstairs to the hallway where the\nfireplace “gas key” hung.  Because he can see well enough in near darkness, he left the\nlights off, took the key from its hook and crept down the staircase.  The solid boots\npressed the old hardwood hard enough for Mama, dozing in her room, to feel each slow,\ncareful step.\n\nIn the den he knelt at the brick fireplace, inserted the key into the fake gas-valve\nhole, and turned.  The metal key rasped against the metal lock — the faint “metal on\nmetal” Mama later recalled.  The panel swung open; Casey removed the canvas bag of\nAfrican gold coins, closed the safe, re-set the panel, and slipped the key back to its\nhook on his way to bed.  The whole job took only a few minutes and required no light.\nBefore dawn he stowed the coins in the bottom of his small travel bag, planning to\ndrive away with them later that morning.\n\nWhen Ernestine checked the den at daybreak the hiding place was empty.  Re-playing the\nnoises she had felt and heard in the night, she quickly eliminated everyone who could\nnot have moved that way in darkness – leaving Casey as the only possible thief.  She\ngathered the family, pointed straight at him and demanded to know why he had done it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Michael McCormick Jr.:  Admitted that he cannot see in the dark; would have had to\n   switch on lights, which Mama would certainly have heard.  \n•  Connie McCormick:  Walks with a pronounced limp and a cane.  Her gait would be\n   uneven and the cane would click on the wood floor, unlike the “quiet and steady”\n   footsteps Mama sensed.  \n•  Ellen McCormick:  Extremely light and graceful; she cannot make “heavy” footfalls.\n   Mama would have heard nothing, not felt vibrations.  In addition, Ellen’s light\n   slippers would scarcely create a metal-on-metal sound at the fireplace lock.  \nThus the evidence clears Michael, Connie and Ellen, leaving Casey as the lone culprit.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The family members were not quite certain whom she was pointing her shaking finger at. As if reading their minds, she said, “I’m sensing that your grandfather is with us.”\nEllen respectfully asked, “Do you really believe that Papa McCormick took the coins?”\nErnestine controlled her fury for the sake of her favorite granddaughter. She took a few deep breaths and began to speak, “No, I don’t, dear, but I know who did. She asked, “Casey, why in the world did you steal your grandfather’s coins?”\nCasey asked, feebly, “What makes you think I have them?”\nErnestine answered, “I may be old but I notice things. Last night, I heard footsteps, doors opening and a faint metallic sound. This morning I checked and, sure enough, somebody took the key and opened the safe in the middle of the night.”\nPatiently, Casey asked again, “So, why do you think I did it”\nQuietly, Ernestine answered, “It’s simple, really. Your father cannot see in the dark. I know that whoever was moving around in the night did not turn on any lights because I did not hear any switches being flipped. It wasn’t your mother because she would have had too much difficulty and made too much noise, especially going downstairs in the dark. Your sister would be just the opposite. She is too quiet and graceful to have done it. If she wanted to sneak around this house, nobody would have heard anything. Now Casey, you had a situation where luck met opportunity.”\nEvenly, Casey replied, “OK, it was me, but I wasn’t stealing them, Mama.” Wryly, he said, “You and Papa Mike have made sure we do not need to steal anything from anybody. I simply wished to have them cleaned and presented to you as a surprise.”\nErnestine believed him and her attitude softened. Casey saw this and playfully asked, “What makes you think it was not Papa’s ghost?”\nErnestine took a deep breath. Sadly, she said, “I don’t know if I really believe in ghosts.” Sighing, she added, “I simply don’t know. It’s just so comforting to think he is here with me.” Mama paused for a moment to think about what she was saying, and then continued, “Besides, even if he were here, he doesn’t come upstairs. You have to have the key to open the safe.” Ernestine paused once again before adding, “Sweetie, what gave you away was that you just made a little bit too much noise for it to be Papa’s ghost. … That and your heavy footsteps in those army boots.”\nEveryone laughed at this. Grinning, Casey said, “Everyone come upstairs and I will give Mama back the coins. They are on my bed. I was going to stuff them in my pockets just before leaving.” Casey paused, and then asked, “Would you like for me to have them cleaned? I realize now I should have asked.”\nSmiling now, Mama replied, “No, but thanks for the thought. I prefer to leave things the way Papa left them.”\nUpon arriving in Casey’s bedroom, they all saw that there were no coins on the bed.

      "mystery_text": "Ernestine “Mama” McCormick was one day shy of her 100th birthday. Tomorrow, Michael, Connie and her two grandchildren would celebrate. But, that was tomorrow. Now, she had other things on her mind. It was a few minutes before midnight and the familiar sounds coming from the downstairs den were especially loud. Ernestine was a strong, spiritual person and she felt the presence of her deceased husband’s spirit within the large house. She was convinced that it was Mike who visited the den every night after she retired to her bed. Hidden within a false wall in their home were rare and valuable gold coins -- coins that Mike had obtained in Africa shortly after the war. Mike had cherished the coins, and Ernestine sensed, or thought she sensed, that Mike was struggling to obtain them. She feared setting the coins out for him, lest he leave with them and not return. How a ghost would do this, she did not know. But his absence was something she dreaded. Every morning, Ernestine would survey the den. Sometimes, she could tell the room had been disturbed. Ernestine would not allow the maid to dust the den for this reason. One morning she had noticed the dust collecting on the gas cutoff feeding the fireplace. Near it, several magazines on the large coffee table had been strewn about the richly finished wood floor. Ernestine suspected the cause to be strong drafts drawn by the huge fireplace – or was it indeed Mike’s ghost thrashing about in frustration? Ernestine kept the “gas key,” which was the key to the disguised den wall safe, hanging on the wall upstairs. She learned long ago that Mike’s spirit would not come upstairs – or anywhere near her. Ernestine took the presence of Mike’s spirit seriously. The family mansion, which had been constructed in the late 1950s, still had the old-fashioned light switches it was originally built with. She kept these because of the loud click they made when flipped on or off. As far as she could recall, she had never heard a light switch go on or off in the middle of the night. She also refused to change the arrangement of furniture or the placement of pictures on the mansion’s many walls. In her mind, if it was Mike, she wanted him to feel at home. But nearing 100, Ernestine knew her senses could not be all that trustworthy. She asked herself often: Is Mike truly with me, or is it an old lady’s wishful thinking? All of this ran through Ernestine’s mind as she lay silently in bed. The next day, Michael and Connie were the first to arrive in the middle of the morning. Their children, Casey and Ellen, arrived early in the afternoon. The McCormick family was not just any family. The late Mike McCormick, Sr. was the founder of McCormick Plastics and had made his fortune in the years following World War II, when the nation’s appetite for all things plastic became insatiable. McCormick Plastics was a multi-billion dollar global corporation, and had been since the early 1960s. McCormick had offices and factories all over the world. Michael, Jr. and his brothers held key posts with the corporation. By the middle of the afternoon, Mama Ernestine, as she was called, was holding court in the dining room. A light lunch was being catered and she was up for the occasion. She was in excellent health physically and had lost none of her formidable mental faculties. As the family sat around the table, she silently took stock of those she loved dearly. Sadly, she reflected that her 65-year-old son, Michael, appeared to be in poor health. Michael was at least 40 pounds overweight and in the early stages of emphysema, caused by many years of smoking. He was chronically nearsighted and wore glasses so thick the lenses appeared to be coke bottle bottoms. As if reading his mother’s mind, he said, “I can see OK with the glasses, but cannot see well in the dark anymore, even with them on. I don’t know what we would do without our driver.” Ernestine smiled and kept her concerns to herself. She asked daughter-in-law, Connie, how she was doing. Connie had suffered polio in the 1950s epidemic and one leg was shorter than the other. She walked unevenly and with the help of a cane an elevated shoe. Connie replied, “I’m getting along OK, but the doc tells me to wear hard soled and heeled shoes at all times to avoid bone spurs.” Connie laughed, “This big shoe feels like a bowling ball sometimes but I’m not complaining. At least I can get around.” Ernestine nodded. Connie’s ability to laugh at herself was something she admired very much. She turned to Casey, her 36-year-old grandson. Casey was the free spirit in the family and it showed today. Casey had arrived at the McCormick house wearing a tank top, baggy military fatigue trousers and heavy soled boots. He had a small plastic bag with a change of socks and underwear. That was all he brought with him. Ernestine teased him, “Are you a Rambo wannabe?” The good natured Casey grinned back at her and said, “I suppose so.” Next, Ernestine surveyed Ellen. Ellen was 29 and an accomplished ballet dancer. Ernestine figured there was no way she could weigh more than 90 pounds. Ernestine considered that she would have made an excellent spy or cat burglar. She was able to appear and disappear unnoticed, so graceful and quiet were her body movements. She asked Ellen, “How is the dancing going?” “It’s going great, Mama. I’ve been able to raise several thousand dollars for the McCormick Foundation since last time I saw you.” Ernestine was fiercely proud of her granddaughter. She motioned for her to come closer. She kissed Ellen on the cheek and said, “Dear, I’m so proud of you! Keep up the good work.” The family had a wonderful visit over the late lunch. A light dinner and birthday cake would be enjoyed later. Before retiring for an afternoon nap, Ernestine decided it was time to tell them of her suspicions concerning their grandfather’s ghost. “Now, all of you will think this is the rambling of an old lady. Maybe it is, but hear me out. You’ve heard me speak of your grandfather’s African coins. We even showed them to you once when you younger ones were kids. Well, they are not in a safety deposit box like we told you – they are in a hidden safe in the den. The keyhole for the fireplace gas valve in the den is really the lock to the safe. That’s where the coins are. Several times a week … most nights, really, I hear noises down there, as if your grandfather is trying to get to the safe. Everyone was polite enough not to scoff at Mama Ernestine’s story. That night, they enjoyed Mama’s party. Everyone was in bed by 11:00 p.m. Sure enough, around 2:00 a.m., Ernestine heard noises in the night, only this time they were different. She heard the faint creaking of a door and felt the quiet and steady -- but heavy -- footsteps on the hardwood floors. She thought she heard the clicking of metal on metal downstairs. Ernestine didn’t know what to think and did not sleep the remainder of the night. In the morning, upon inspection of the den and wall safe, her fears were confirmed. Sitting on the sofa and pondering the situation for a few minutes, she realized what had happened: Someone had stolen the gold coins. With great agitation, she called the family together before breakfast. She held her temper long enough to explain what happened and, showing them the empty wall safe, said, “I know who did this.” Pointing to the guilty person, she said, heatedly, “Shame on you! Why did you do this?”",

      "outcome": "The family members were not quite certain whom she was pointing her shaking finger at. As if reading their minds, she said, “I’m sensing that your grandfather is with us.”\nEllen respectfully asked, “Do you really believe that Papa McCormick took the coins?”\nErnestine controlled her fury for the sake of her favorite granddaughter. She took a few deep breaths and began to speak, “No, I don’t, dear, but I know who did. She asked, “Casey, why in the world did you steal your grandfather’s coins?”\nCasey asked, feebly, “What makes you think I have them?”\nErnestine answered, “I may be old but I notice things. Last night, I heard footsteps, doors opening and a faint metallic sound. This morning I checked and, sure enough, somebody took the key and opened the safe in the middle of the night.”\nPatiently, Casey asked again, “So, why do you think I did it”\nQuietly, Ernestine answered, “It’s simple, really. Your father cannot see in the dark. I know that whoever was moving around in the night did not turn on any lights because I did not hear any switches being flipped. It wasn’t your mother because she would have had too much difficulty and made too much noise, especially going downstairs in the dark. Your sister would be just the opposite. She is too quiet and graceful to have done it. If she wanted to sneak around this house, nobody would have heard anything. Now Casey, you had a situation where luck met opportunity.”\nEvenly, Casey replied, “OK, it was me, but I wasn’t stealing them, Mama.” Wryly, he said, “You and Papa Mike have made sure we do not need to steal anything from anybody. I simply wished to have them cleaned and presented to you as a surprise.”\nErnestine believed him and her attitude softened. Casey saw this and playfully asked, “What makes you think it was not Papa’s ghost?”\nErnestine took a deep breath. Sadly, she said, “I don’t know if I really believe in ghosts.” Sighing, she added, “I simply don’t know. It’s just so comforting to think he is here with me.” Mama paused for a moment to think about what she was saying, and then continued, “Besides, even if he were here, he doesn’t come upstairs. You have to have the key to open the safe.” Ernestine paused once again before adding, “Sweetie, what gave you away was that you just made a little bit too much noise for it to be Papa’s ghost. … That and your heavy footsteps in those army boots.”\nEveryone laughed at this. Grinning, Casey said, “Everyone come upstairs and I will give Mama back the coins. They are on my bed. I was going to stuff them in my pockets just before leaving.” Casey paused, and then asked, “Would you like for me to have them cleaned? I realize now I should have asked.”\nSmiling now, Mama replied, “No, but thanks for the thought. I prefer to leave things the way Papa left them.”\nUpon arriving in Casey’s bedroom, they all saw that there were no coins on the bed. Instead, an old business card of Mike’s was found on Casey’s pillow -- one that Ernestine had not seen in many years. Casey looked ill but Ernestine knew exactly what happened and all doubts concerning her husband’s spirit were erased. Excitedly, she said, “Mike’s been here. He came up and got them when we were all downstairs. I believe he will be at peace now, but I hope he will stay around.”\nJust then, a gentle gust of cool, refreshing air swept into the room. They all felt it. Mama said, with emotion wracking her ancient voice, “Yes, he’s still here. He’s broken his rule to remain upstairs to be near us.”"
