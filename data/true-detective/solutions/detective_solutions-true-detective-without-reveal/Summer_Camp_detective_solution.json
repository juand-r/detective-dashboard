    "full_text": "The alarm woke Diane to another fabulous New Hampshire day. It was her third summer working as a counselor at Camp Trevya on Lake Winnipesauke, where she spent her days swimming in the lake, hiking in the mountain woods and breathing in the fresh mountain air. Being the senior camp counselor, Diane got first choice of cabins. She always picked the cabin a bit farther from camp because it had the best view of the lake. More important to Diane, it had permanent screens covering the windows, to keep bugs out. Some of the closer cabins had screens that could be opened, which let bugs in (and, let sneaky campers – out). As she looked out the window of the cabin, she could see the sunlight starting to brighten the eastern sky. This morning she was tired. For the third night in a row, Lizzie, one of her campers, had needed to use the bathroom at 3:00 a.m. Diane, being a counselor, had to escort her to the facilities, by the dining hall. At least last night Lizzie hadn’t begged Diane to get her ice for her nightly glass of water. She had finally understood that the ice machine was in the kitchen, and that the kitchen was locked at night. Luckily, Lizzie would only be at camp for one week. Diane had to hurry if she wanted to catch the sunrise before going to blow revelry over the loudspeakers to awaken the camp. Blasting everyone out of bed each morning was always a pleasure to her, for among other things, she was a prankster who loved playing tricks on people. With a smile on her face she headed out the cabin door. “AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!” No need for revelry today. Her scream woke the entire camp. Diane looked around and there was water and ice everywhere. Someone had rigged several large buckets of ice water to dump as soon as she or one of the campers in her cabin walked out the door. Once she got over the shock of being soaked, she laughed, “Does someone want to challenge me to a prank-off!” She would get the upper hand, but first Diane had to figure out who was responsible for the joke. There were only four possibilities. The first being the campers in her cabin. The other three suspects were fellow counselors, occupying the three other cabins. Diane was just starting to think about the suspects when all five of her campers came out of the cabin onto the porch. “What happened?” one of the campers asked. “Simple” said Diane. “Someone rigged all of these buckets so that as soon as the door to our cabin opened, they would dump water onto the person’s head. I was the lucky one to walk out first, so I got soaked.” By this point, everyone else from camp had shown up to see what had caused the scream. Now that everyone could see that no one was hurt, everyone was having a really good laugh looking at Diane standing there like a drowned rat. Diane laughed as well, for she knew that she would eventually get the last laugh. Looking around, Diane noticed that two of the three counselors were not there. “Has anyone seen Tom or Allie?” An answer came from a laughing onlooker in the crowd, “If you weren’t all wet and disheveled, maybe you’d remember that Tom has kitchen duty this week!” Yes, Diane did remember. She also remembered that whoever had kitchen duty had to be at the dining hall by 5:00 a.m. to unlock the kitchen, scrub the floors and to begin preparing breakfast for the campers. Looking right at Danny, she asked “Has anyone seen Allie?” Allie was the other female counselor and someone that Diane had pulled a fantastic prank on two summers ago. Danny just shrugged. One of the campers replied for him. “She had to take Cindy into the ER about midnight last night … she’s not back yet.” “What happened?” “Well, Danny took some of us on a hike yesterday that went almost 20 miles through the mountains. We didn’t get back until fairly late and everyone just went to bed and passed out exhausted. During the night, Cindy got horrible cramps in her calves. Allie tried massaging it, a heating pad and everything else she could think of, but nothing seemed to help. She should be back soon.” That was it. Diane knew who the prankster was.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Identify what the prank required  \n   • several large buckets + lots of ice water.  \n   • buckets had to be hung AFTER 3 a.m. (when Diane last opened the door to take Lizzie to the bathroom – if the trap had been there then, she would already have been drenched).  \n   • the ice was still solid at dawn, so it had been collected only a short time earlier.\n\n2. Who could get that much ice in the middle of the night?  \n   • The only source mentioned is the camp kitchen’s ice-machine, which is locked at night.  \n   • The counselor who has kitchen duty receives the key and must unlock the kitchen before 5 a.m.  This week that counselor is TOM.\n\n3. Who could physically approach the cabin between 3 a.m. and dawn?  \n   • Diane’s five campers could not: their cabin windows have permanent screens that cannot be opened, and exiting by the only door would have triggered the trap while Diane was still outside with Lizzie.  \n   • ALLIE drove a camper to the ER at about midnight and had not yet returned.  \n   • DANNY was on the scene with the crowd.  He had freedom of movement, but no access to the locked kitchen (and therefore no ice) unless he burglarised it, which the story never hints at.\n\n4. Motive  \n   • Tom and Diane habitually play pranks on one another.  He would love to “get” her on the first morning of his kitchen-duty week.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   • The ONLY person with both the key to the ice machine and the opportunity to set up the trap after 3 a.m. is Tom.  When Diane heard Tom was on kitchen duty (key to ice) and that Allie was off-site, the solution became obvious to her.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDiane’s five campers, Tom (counselor on kitchen duty), Allie (counselor at ER), Danny (counselor)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nTom (camp counselor, on kitchen duty)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Around 4:30 a.m., Tom got up early for his 5 a.m. kitchen shift, unlocked the kitchen with the duty key, and filled several large buckets with ice and water from the ice machine and sink.  \n• He quietly carried the buckets to Diane’s remote cabin, knowing it was far enough from others that he would not easily be spotted.  \n• Because Diane and her campers were already back inside (they had returned from Lizzie’s 3 a.m. bathroom trip), he could work undisturbed.  \n• Tom balanced and tied the buckets so they would tip as soon as the cabin door was opened outward.  \n• He hustled back to the dining hall and began his kitchen chores, giving himself a perfect alibi of “being on duty” when the prank triggered.  \n• At dawn Diane opened the door to watch the sunrise, the rig released, and she was drenched in icy water— exactly as Tom had planned.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Diane’s campers – They had no source of ice (kitchen locked) and could not leave the cabin unnoticed: the windows are permanently screened and if they had used the door after 3 a.m. the trap would already have sprung.  \n• Allie – She was off the camp property all night, driving Cindy to the emergency room; therefore she had no opportunity to set up the prank after 3 a.m.  \n• Danny – Although he was present for the aftermath, he lacked the kitchen key and hence access to the ice required.  No evidence suggests he broke into the kitchen.  \nWith means (ice), opportunity (key and early-morning duty) and motive (prank rivalry), only Tom fits.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
