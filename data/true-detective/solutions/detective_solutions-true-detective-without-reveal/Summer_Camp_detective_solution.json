    "full_text": "The alarm woke Diane to another fabulous New Hampshire day. It was her third summer working as a counselor at Camp Trevya on Lake Winnipesauke, where she spent her days swimming in the lake, hiking in the mountain woods and breathing in the fresh mountain air. Being the senior camp counselor, Diane got first choice of cabins. She always picked the cabin a bit farther from camp because it had the best view of the lake. More important to Diane, it had permanent screens covering the windows, to keep bugs out. Some of the closer cabins had screens that could be opened, which let bugs in (and, let sneaky campers – out). As she looked out the window of the cabin, she could see the sunlight starting to brighten the eastern sky. This morning she was tired. For the third night in a row, Lizzie, one of her campers, had needed to use the bathroom at 3:00 a.m. Diane, being a counselor, had to escort her to the facilities, by the dining hall. At least last night Lizzie hadn’t begged Diane to get her ice for her nightly glass of water. She had finally understood that the ice machine was in the kitchen, and that the kitchen was locked at night. Luckily, Lizzie would only be at camp for one week. Diane had to hurry if she wanted to catch the sunrise before going to blow revelry over the loudspeakers to awaken the camp. Blasting everyone out of bed each morning was always a pleasure to her, for among other things, she was a prankster who loved playing tricks on people. With a smile on her face she headed out the cabin door. “AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!” No need for revelry today. Her scream woke the entire camp. Diane looked around and there was water and ice everywhere. Someone had rigged several large buckets of ice water to dump as soon as she or one of the campers in her cabin walked out the door. Once she got over the shock of being soaked, she laughed, “Does someone want to challenge me to a prank-off!” She would get the upper hand, but first Diane had to figure out who was responsible for the joke. There were only four possibilities. The first being the campers in her cabin. The other three suspects were fellow counselors, occupying the three other cabins. Diane was just starting to think about the suspects when all five of her campers came out of the cabin onto the porch. “What happened?” one of the campers asked. “Simple” said Diane. “Someone rigged all of these buckets so that as soon as the door to our cabin opened, they would dump water onto the person’s head. I was the lucky one to walk out first, so I got soaked.” By this point, everyone else from camp had shown up to see what had caused the scream. Now that everyone could see that no one was hurt, everyone was having a really good laugh looking at Diane standing there like a drowned rat. Diane laughed as well, for she knew that she would eventually get the last laugh. Looking around, Diane noticed that two of the three counselors were not there. “Has anyone seen Tom or Allie?” An answer came from a laughing onlooker in the crowd, “If you weren’t all wet and disheveled, maybe you’d remember that Tom has kitchen duty this week!” Yes, Diane did remember. She also remembered that whoever had kitchen duty had to be at the dining hall by 5:00 a.m. to unlock the kitchen, scrub the floors and to begin preparing breakfast for the campers. Looking right at Danny, she asked “Has anyone seen Allie?” Allie was the other female counselor and someone that Diane had pulled a fantastic prank on two summers ago. Danny just shrugged. One of the campers replied for him. “She had to take Cindy into the ER about midnight last night … she’s not back yet.” “What happened?” “Well, Danny took some of us on a hike yesterday that went almost 20 miles through the mountains. We didn’t get back until fairly late and everyone just went to bed and passed out exhausted. During the night, Cindy got horrible cramps in her calves. Allie tried massaging it, a heating pad and everything else she could think of, but nothing seemed to help. She should be back soon.” That was it. Diane knew who the prankster was.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  First, note exactly WHEN the buckets must have been put in place.\n    •  Diane escorted Lizzie to the bathroom at 3 a.m.  \n       – When she opened the cabin door then, no water fell on them.  \n       – Therefore the prank was set up after 3 a.m.\n2.  What was needed to prepare the prank after 3 a.m.?  \n    •  Several large buckets had to be filled with ICE-water, not just water.  \n    •  The story stresses twice that the kitchen – the only place with an ice-\n       machine – is locked at night and is opened only by the counselor who\n       has kitchen duty at 5 a.m.  \n       – That means that between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. the ONLY person who could\n         legally get into the kitchen (and therefore get ice) was the counselor\n         on kitchen duty.\n\n3.  Where were the four possible suspects between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.?  \n    •  Diane’s own five campers – inside the cabin, behind screens, and under\n      Diane’s supervision from 3 a.m. onward; they had no access to the ice\n      that was locked in the kitchen.  \n    •  Allie – drove Cindy to the emergency room about midnight and “isn’t\n      back yet.”  She was off the property, so she had no opportunity.  \n    •  Danny – exhausted from the 20-mile hike and still looking after the rest\n      of his campers.  Even if he had got up again, he had no key to the\n      kitchen and thus no ice supply.  \n    •  Tom – has kitchen duty this week.  By camp rule he must arrive at the\n      dining hall by 5 a.m. to UNLOCK the kitchen.  With the key he can get\n      all the ice he wants exactly in the correct time window.  Nothing in\n      the story gives him an alibi for the period 4 a.m.–5 a.m.\n\n4.  The instant Diane hears that Allie is away at the hospital she can\n    eliminate Allie.  Since she already knows that the prank had to be set up\n    after 3 a.m. AND that ice was required from the locked kitchen, the only\n    remaining person with opportunity is the counselor who opened that\n    kitchen – Tom.  That is why “That was it.  Diane knew who the prankster\n    was.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTom, Allie, Danny, Diane’s five campers\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTom\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly after 4 a.m. Tom got up extra early for his 5 a.m. kitchen-duty shift.\nOn the way to the dining hall he picked up the key that lets the kitchen-duty\ncounselor unlock the kitchen.  Once inside, he filled several large buckets\nwith water and scooped generous amounts of ice from the ice machine.  He then\ncarried the buckets to Diane’s cabin (a short walk), balanced or suspended\nthem so that opening the door would tip them over, and connected whatever\nstring or sticks were needed for the trigger.  He finished his handiwork, went\nback to the dining hall, opened the kitchen officially at 5 a.m. and started\nscrubbing floors.  Around sunrise Diane opened her cabin door, the rig\nreleased, and the ice-water cascade accomplished its mission, leaving Tom\nsafely “at work” in the kitchen and laughing to himself.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Diane’s campers – They had no way to obtain ice after the kitchen was\n   locked, and the prank was not in place when Diane took Lizzie to the\n   bathroom at 3 a.m.; it was set up later while they were all inside asleep.\n\n•  Allie – She had left camp about midnight to take Cindy to the emergency\n   room and had not yet returned, so she was physically absent.\n\n•  Danny – Although he was on the grounds, he did not possess the kitchen key\n   and therefore had no access to the large quantity of ice needed in the\n   critical 3 a.m.–5 a.m. window.  Moreover, he was exhausted from the\n   20-mile hike and busy with his own campers.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
