    "full_text": "Turkeys have excellent hearing. On the first Tuesday of October, when the five-bird flock was out pecking around in the yard behind Farmer MacDougall’s home, they overheard the chilling words that would drive one of them to attempted man-slaughter. Farmer MacDougall and a stranger were standing in front of the open kitchen window of the house, looking out at the turkeys. “We’re only asking for one,” the stranger said. “Surely, you can spare one for the Thanksgiving dinner down at the Mission this year, Farmer MacDougall. It would help feed a number of disadvantaged families.” At the mere mention of the word ‘Thanksgiving’, the big birds in the yard froze. Beaker and Beau stopped gobbling at one another. Red stopped her clipped beak in mid-preen. The newest addition to the flock, a Canadian bird named Leaf, who’d kept to himself for the week he’d been on the farm so far, cocked a beady eye at the window. While Old Leatherneck, twelve years-young and counting, was instantly jolted awake, his blue and red wattles flying as he jerked his head upwards. “Well, I don’t know,” Farmer MacDougall said, scratching the stubble on his chin. “I’m mighty attached to all of my birds. I’ve never really considered them food, except for the eggs, of course. Why, I just don’t-” “Farmer MacDougall, please!” the stranger interrupted. “We know we’re going to be short of turkeys this year – what with the Poultry Mill shutting down. And with the economic recession, monetary donations are way down with which to buy turkeys. We’re only asking you for one!” The five turkeys stared up at Farmer MacDougall, as he looked down at them. He rubbed his jaw, in behind his ear. Normally, he would give some money to the Mission himself. But times were tough. “Weeelll, ookaay, you can have one bird … I guess.” Red fell over in a dead faint, while Beau and Beaker’s tail feathers fanned up in alarm. * “You all know why we’re here,” Beau stated a day later, looking around at the other four turkeys gathered in the barn. A heavy frost had crusted the ground that morning, fall and fall suppers truly in the air now. “Why?” Red asked. Even for a turkey, she was a particularly dumb cluck. “Because we all live here, that’s why,” Beaker said impatiently. “Where else are we going to be?” “No!” Beau retorted, shaking his snood in frustration. “Because Farmer MacDougall is going to kill one of us for the Mission’s Thanksgiving dinner. Our necks are on the line!” “Not mine,” Old Leatherneck crowed. “I’m too old and stringy, wouldn’t make much of a meal.” “Well, as a hen, I’m only half as heavy as you toms,” Red said, primping her feathers, “so I wouldn’t feed many – would I?” “We have to stop Farmer MacDougall,” Beau intoned meaningfully, his eyes darting from one bird to the other, way over to Leaf off by himself in a corner of the barn. “We have to get him before he gets one of us.” There was a general ruckus of yelping and whistling at that pronouncement. The turkeys liked Farmer MacDougall and the way he treated them – lots of mash and grains to eat, plenty of water, straw-lined nooks to roost in and a free range to stretch their legs. But now, with their lives at stake, they realized they had to flock together. “What exactly are you suggesting?” Old Leatherneck queried. “Wait a minute!” Beaker exclaimed. “I’ve got it! I can write to the President and ask for a pardon. He does that, you know, for certain birds.” Beau scoffed. “You can’t write.” “No, but I can peck out a letter on Farmer MacDougall’s computer.” “Good luck with that,” Old Leatherneck stated sourly. “I think what Beau is saying is that Farmer MacDougall has to have an accident,” Leaf suddenly spoke up from across the barn, the first time he had said anything to the other birds. “Right, Beau?” “Exactly,” the big bird beaked. The turkeys looked at one another, their walnut-sized brains working. * It was a cold, foggy morning the second Tuesday in October, when Farmer MacDougall walked out of his house and across the yard to the barn, intent on milking Brown Betty the cow. His eyes were bleary after another sleepless night – the recent turkey promise he’d made to the Mission man was weighing heavily on his mind – and so, as he pulled the barn door open, he failed to notice the rake lying half-buried in the straw just inside the door. He stepped into the barn, onto the steel-pronged end of the leaf and grass-gathering tool. The long, heavy wooden handle of the rake shot upwards and struck him square in the forehead. He dropped like a sack of turkey feed and lay still in the straw. * The five turkeys filed out of their pen at the rear of the barn when Farmer MacDougall was late with their breakfast. They found the old sod-tiller, flat on his back. “Good gravy!” Red yelped. “Farmer MacDougall’s had an accident!” Old Leatherneck stepped forward and examined the rake lying across Farmer MacDougall’s chest, poked around in the straw and came up with a tail feather. “Was no ‘accident’,” the old bird concluded. “We turkeys have powerful legs and long, strong toes, just right for dragging a rake into the proper position. Looks to me like someone tried to get Farmer MacDougall to buy the farm, like we all talked about last week.” He stroked his beard with a wing, gazing at the assembled turkeys, Leaf by himself off to the side. “And I think I can guess who the dirty bird is,” he added. Just as Farmer MacDougall raised his head and gave it a shake. The man groaned, feeling like he’d just had the stuffing knocked out of him.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. MOTIVE  \n   •  Which bird is most likely to be selected for the Mission’s Thanksgiving dinner?  \n     – Farmer MacDougall has owned Beau, Beaker, Red and Old Leatherneck for years and is “mighty attached” to them.  \n     – Leaf has been on the farm only a week; the farmer has no attachment to him.  \n     – Therefore Leaf, the newcomer, has by far the strongest motive – his neck is the one that is really on the line.  \n\n2. WORD-PLAY CLUE  \n   •  Farmer MacDougall steps on “the steel-pronged end of the LEAF-and-grass-gathering tool.”  \n   •  The author could have written simply “rake,” yet the longer description deliberately highlights the word “LEAF.”  \n   •  That points an accusing finger at the turkey whose very name is Leaf.  \n\n3. STATEMENTS & BEHAVIOUR  \n   •  During the barn meeting, no one has the nerve to suggest actual violence until Leaf suddenly speaks up:  \n     “I think what Beau is saying is that Farmer MacDougall has to have an accident.”  \n   •  Leaf keeps to himself, standing apart in both barn scenes – classic behaviour of someone hiding guilty knowledge.  \n\n4. OPPORTUNITY & PHYSICAL EVIDENCE  \n   •  All five birds are free inside the barn overnight; any of them could drag a rake.  \n   •  Turkeys moult tail feathers easily when they tug or drag things. Old Leatherneck finds a single tail feather in the straw.  \n   •  Domestic bronze turkeys (Beau, Beaker, Red, Leatherneck) have brown-buff tail feathers.  \n     Canadian wild turkeys (the type Leaf would be) have a dark feather with a broad black band and a light tip – instantly recognisable.  \n   •  Leatherneck’s “I think I can guess who the dirty bird is” shows the feather’s colouring makes the culprit obvious.  \n\nTaken together—motive, the pun on “leaf” rake, his advocacy of an “accident,” his isolation, and the tell-tale feather—everything singles out Leaf and no one else.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBeau, Beaker, Red, Leaf, Old Leatherneck\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nLeaf  (the Canadian turkey, newest member of the flock)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring the night before the second Tuesday in October, Leaf slipped out of the pen while the others dozed.  \nKnowing Farmer MacDougall always enters the barn first thing in the morning, he dragged the light, long-handled leaf-and-grass rake across the straw so that its steel prongs lay hidden just inside the door with the handle lying flat, ready to pivot upward. In the process a distinctive dark-banded tail feather was pulled free and remained in the straw.  \nAt dawn the unsuspecting farmer opened the door, stepped on the prongs and the handle flew up, striking him in the forehead and knocking him unconscious.  \nLater, when the turkeys came looking for breakfast, Old Leatherneck examined the scene, spotted the Canadian-pattern feather, and immediately realised that the newcomer Leaf had set the trap.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nBeau – Lots of bluster, but he never advocated actual harm; his bronze tail feathers do not match the one found.  \nBeaker – More interested in writing a letter to the President than planning violence; no incriminating feather.  \nRed – Physically smaller; would have had great difficulty dragging the long, heavy rake into position; her tail feathers are light and could not be mistaken for the one Leatherneck found.  \nOld Leatherneck – Too old to worry about being chosen, and he is the one who conducts the investigation; staging the attack then exposing it himself makes no sense.  \nOnly Leaf had the overwhelming motive, voiced the plan, had the physical capacity, and left behind a feather that unmistakably identified him.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
