    "full_text": "Highway 59 and Groven Road was rural bus driver Ed Tuttle’s last stop to pick up kids before he entered the city. As usual, five middle school students were waiting for him at the stop: Marty Nolan, his brother Johnny, Lyle Esposito, Chloe Streamer and Susan Moorgate. Just as usual, the kids were rambunctiously yelling and pushing at each other, as Ed pulled up in a cloud of diesel fumes. Ed Tuttle was a former police officer, driving the school bus in his retirement years to supplement his pension, and the students respected the big, burly ex-cop. Some of the children even downright feared him. “Morning, Mr. Tuttle,” Marty Nolan said politely, the first of the five to board the bus. The stocky thirteen year-old had his hockey bag looped over his shoulder. The large bag bulged tight with equipment, wedging against the handrails in the stairwell of the bus. “Game tonight?” Ed asked. “You bet, Mr. Tuttle,” Marty responded enthusiastically. “We’re whipping Glenford tonight.” Ed smiled. He admired the kid’s spirit, if not his playing ability, which consisted mainly of elbows and stick work. “Put the bag under your seat, okay?” Marty nodded and crab-walked down the aisle of the bus. Lyle Esposito was next on board, carrying his French horn. He said hello to Ed, then stumbled on a step and sprawled headlong in front of the man. His French horn case broke open to reveal the large golden instrument inside. It was packed tight into the case’s molded, red velvet lining, so it wouldn’t rattle around and get damaged when carried. As a result, it stayed stuck in the form fitting lining now, preventing it from flying out and hitting the aisle or Ed. “Careful with that, son,” Ed said. “Clasp it back together and then stow it under your seat.” Lyle nodded, red-faced. He secured the heavy case and hefted it down the aisle to where Marty was sitting and laughing. “Hi, Mr. Tuttle!” Susan Moorgate sang out, running up the steps, her small Hello Kitty lunchbox rattling. A notorious tattletale, Susan said, “I’ll be sure to let you know if anyone misbehaves on the ride into the city, Mr. Tuttle!” Ed gave the redheaded twelve year-old a tight smile as she skipped past. Chloe Streamer trudged up the steps next, a large backpack strapped to her back. She turned to snip at Johnny Nolan behind her. “I still say Mrs. Murphy only picked you for first flute because she wanted a token boy in the front row.” The girl sniffed and turned back around, smiling sweetly at Ed. Finally, Johnny Nolan climbed aboard the bus, his small flute case in one hand and his lunchbox in the other. “Mr. Tuttle,” he said, serious as always. The thin, brown-haired twelve year-old was actually a very good flutist; Ed had heard his solo during a recent school band concert and been impressed. Now, he pulled the door shut and shifted the bus into gear. “Hey, look everybody, it’s Zamfir!” Marty yelled at the other kids, as Johnny walked down the aisle and sat down in an empty seat. Macho Marty was always making fun of his kid brother for playing the flute, a musical instrument he considered ‘unmanly’. Ed locked eyes with the loudmouth in his rearview mirror, and Marty sheepishly grinned and shut his mouth. Ed tromped on the accelerator, headed for Point West Middle School ten miles away. Johnny sat by himself on the right-hand side of the bus, near the back, his lunchbox clasped next to him on the seat, flute case between his feet on the floor. Chloe and Susan sat on the padded bench seat in front of him. Behind him sat Lyle and Marty. Chloe promptly popped up and stuck out her tongue at Johnny. “Teacher’s pet!” she sneered. Johnny kicked the back of the seat, making both girls scream. Ed’s reflected eyes glared at them, and Susan pointed an accusing finger back at Johnny. “Whoever heard of a guy playing a flute, anyway?” Marty piped up from in back of his brother. “Right, Lyle?” He jabbed his buddy in the ribs, practicing his hockey moves. Lyle nodded, grinning. “It is kind of feminine,” the lanky, curly-haired teen agreed. The bus hit a pothole, and everyone jumped a foot or so off their seats. “At least I don’t play the French horn,” Johnny retaliated, glancing back at Lyle. “You’re lucky if you get five notes a concert. Just as well, too, from what I hear.” Lyle blushed and kicked the back of Johnny’s seat. Like all good bus drivers, Ed kept one eye on the road and one on his rearview mirror as he drove, checking on the kids he was carrying. But no one committed the cardinal sin of standing up and moving around while the bus was in motion on that last fifteen-minute leg into the city. That’s why Ed was more than a little surprised when he braked to a stop in the bus loop in front of Point West School and Johnny suddenly shouted from the back, “Hey, somebody stole my flute!” Cop reactions instantly kicking in, Ed jumped out of his seat, spun around and yelled, “Freeze!” Halting all the bus riders in mid get-up. His shrewd, police-trained eyes took in the layout, and then he further barked, “Okay, everybody off! Chloe, Susan, Johnny, Marty and Lyle last!” Ed watched the other kids get off the bus and race for the front doors of the school. Then he beckoned at the remaining five students, and they disembarked along with him. Chloe clung to her backpack, Susan hugging her lunchbox to her chest, the pair scared. Marty, on the other hand, was grinning as he wrestled his bulging equipment bag off the bus, his black hockey helmet on his head. “Figured I might need this,” he joked, tapping the helmet. “In case things get too rough.” Lyle bumped his French horn case down the stairs, followed by Johnny, carrying just his lunchbox now. “Why are you only stopping them, Mr. Tuttle?” he asked. “Some other kid might’ve taken my flute.” Ed shook his head, looking over the four suspects lined up in front of him. “No one stood up or crossed the aisle after you five came on board at the last stop, meaning someone directly in front of or behind you has to have taken your flute. What were you doing, by the way, that you didn’t notice it go missing?” “Sleeping,” Johnny admitted. Chloe laughed. “Do you know who took Johnny’s flute, Susan?” Ed interrogated. The freckle-faced youngster gulped, shook her head. Ed’s hard eyes traveled over the four students, his cop brain working, looking for clues. “Search them!” Johnny suggested. “If only I had that authority,” the man mused, “like in the old days.” Just then the school bell went off, signaling the start of classes for the day. Ed snapped his fingers. “I know who took your flute, Johnny,” the grizzled ex-cop growled. “Sure, I know, Johnny.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who had a REASON to take the flute?\n   • Chloe and Johnny are the two flutists in the school band.  At the stop she taunted him: “Mrs. Murphy only picked you for first flute because she wanted a token boy in the front row.”  \n   • Marty and Lyle merely made fun of Johnny for “playing a girly instrument”, but neither of them benefits if the flute is gone.  \n   • Susan is a born tattletale, but she has no motive at all.\n\n   Motive clearly points at Chloe.\n\n2. Who could REACH the flute without leaving a seat or crossing the aisle?\n   • Johnny put the flute case on the floor between his own feet.  \n   • The seat in front of him (Chloe/Susan) is the only place from which someone can get to that spot easily.  The seat-back blocks the boys behind him.  \n   • Therefore only Chloe or Susan could have taken it during the ride.  Marty and Lyle would have had to crawl under the seat-back – something Ed would have noticed in his mirror.\n\n3. Where could the flute be HIDDEN?\n   • Susan’s little Hello-Kitty lunch-box is far too small for an entire flute case or even for a disassembled flute.  \n   • Lyle’s French-horn case is molded to the exact shape of the horn – Ed saw the inside when it sprang open – so there is literally no room for another instrument.  \n   • Marty’s hockey bag was already crammed full; to shove in a rectangular flute case he would have had to unzip the whole thing and repack it, impossible in the few seconds before the bus stopped.  \n   • Chloe owns the one container that can swallow the flute easily and unnoticed: the large backpack she wore.  After the bus stopped she was “clinging to her backpack” – classic body language of someone guarding concealed loot.\n\n4. What made Ed snap his fingers when the SCHOOL BELL rang?\n   First period is band.  The only person helped by Johnny’s being without a flute right now is his rival, second-chair flutist Chloe.  The bell reminded Ed of the timetable and finished the picture for him:\n\n      motive + means + opportunity = Chloe Streamer.\n\n5. Summation\n   • Strong motive (jealousy over first chair).  \n   • Best physical access (sitting directly in front of the victim).  \n   • Practical hiding place (roomy backpack).  \n   • Telltale behaviour (hugging the pack protectively).  \n\n   All evidence converges on Chloe; no one else fits all four points simultaneously.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nChloe Streamer, Susan Moorgate, Marty Nolan, Lyle Esposito\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nChloe Streamer\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• The students boarded at Highway 59 and Groven Road.  \n• Johnny set his flute case on the floor between his feet and soon nodded off.  \n• Chloe, who was directly in front of him and still smarting over losing first chair, decided to eliminate her competition for band class that morning.  \n• While Ed’s attention was divided between the road and the mirror, Chloe quietly slipped one hand over the back of her seat, opened Johnny’s case, removed the flute (or the whole case), zipped her own backpack, and settled back.  She never had to stand up or cross the aisle.  \n• The pothole distracted everybody and helped cover any small noises she made.  \n• On arrival Johnny reached for his flute, found it gone and shouted.  \n• Ed cleared the bus.  Observing body language and containers, recalling that first period is band (the bell reminded him), he realised Chloe is the only person with motive, opportunity and a practical hiding place.  Hence he identified her as the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Susan Moorgate – Her lunch-box is too small to conceal the flute.  No motive.  \n• Marty Nolan – Though he teases Johnny, his jam-packed hockey bag offered no quick hiding place, and he sat behind a seat-back that blocks direct access to the flute.  \n• Lyle Esposito – The molded French-horn case Ed inspected at the bus stop had no room for a flute; likewise, the seat-back prevented him from reaching the flute without standing up.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Like all good bus drivers, Ed kept one eye on the road and one on his rearview mirror as he drove, checking on the kids he was carrying. But no one committed the cardinal sin of standing up and moving around while the bus was in motion on that last fifteen-minute leg into the city. That’s why Ed was more than a little surprised when he braked to a stop in the bus loop in front of Point West School and Johnny suddenly shouted from the back, “Hey, somebody stole my flute!” Cop reactions instantly kicking in, Ed jumped out of his seat, spun around and yelled, “Freeze!” Halting all the bus riders in mid get-up. His shrewd, police-trained eyes took in the layout, and then he further barked, “Okay, everybody off! Chloe, Susan, Johnny, Marty and Lyle last!” Ed watched the other kids get off the bus and race for the front doors of the school. Then he beckoned at the remaining five students, and they disembarked along with him. Chloe clung to her backpack, Susan hugging her lunchbox to her chest, the pair scared. Marty, on the other hand, was grinning as he wrestled his bulging equipment bag off the bus, his black hockey helmet on his head. “Figured I might need this,” he joked, tapping the helmet. “In case things get too rough.” Lyle bumped his French horn case down the stairs, followed by Johnny, carrying just his lunchbox now. “Why are you only stopping them, Mr. Tuttle?” he asked. “Some other kid might’ve taken my flute.” Ed shook his head, looking over the four suspects lined up in front of him. “No one stood up or crossed the aisle after you five came on board at the last stop, meaning someone directly in front of or behind you has to have taken your flute. What were you doing, by the way, that you didn’t notice it go missing?” “Sleeping,” Johnny admitted. Chloe laughed. “Do you know who took Johnny’s flute, Susan?” Ed interrogated. The freckle-faced youngster gulped, shook her head. Ed’s hard eyes traveled over the four students, his cop brain working, looking for clues. “Search them!” Johnny suggested. “If only I had that authority,” the man mused, “like in the old days.” Just then the school bell went off, signaling the start of classes for the day. Ed snapped his fingers. “I know who took your flute, Johnny,” the grizzled ex-cop growled. “Sure, I know, Johnny.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Chloe Streamer; (b) Lyle Esposito; (c) Marty Nolan; (d) Susan Moorgate",
      "answer": "(c) Marty Nolan",
      "outcome": "The person who took Johnny’s flute had to have a bag, backpack or box large enough to conceal the unscrewed flute in its case. Susan Moorgate only had a small lunchbox; too small to hide a flute. While Lyle Esposito’s French horn case would be large enough for the deed, there is, in fact, no room for a second instrument inside the case, as the interior is molded to the form of the horn for safe handling purposes.\nChloe Streamer had a large enough backpack for the job. But if she’d taken Johnny’s flute, her seatmate, Susan the tattletale, would have surely tattled the tale to Ed.\nMarty Nolan took his brother’s flute. He took it while the boy was sleeping and then stuffed it into his bulging hockey bag, making room for the extra cargo by taking out his hockey helmet and wearing it on his head."
