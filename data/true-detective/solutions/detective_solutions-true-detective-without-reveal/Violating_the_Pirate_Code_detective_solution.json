    "full_text": "“Quartermaster!” Captain Robert’s bellow was usually loud enough to be heard in the maintop, even in a three-reef gale. Today, with the Jackdaw becalmed and wallowing in the Atlantic swell, the noise was deafening. Elijah Fairfax hastened up the companionway to the quarterdeck. “Captain?” “Someone has broken the Code,” Roberts pointed into the cabin of the recently-captured Jackdaw. “One of those scurvy dogs stole for themselves. Ye know the rules. You steal from one, you steal from all. Root out this vile dog. Root him out, and I’ll make him pay.” Fairfax stepped into the cabin that once belonged to the captain of the Jackdaw. This captain and his crew were to be sold as slaves in Whydah, and his sloop would become the latest addition to Robert’s pirate fleet. After the blazing heat of the equatorial sun, the cabin was dark and cool. Fairfax stood on the threshold, letting his eyes adjust. There was not much to see: a cot, a table and chair to port. To starboard, a chest and a row of shelves with fiddles to stop the contents from sliding around in rough seas. On the chest stood a small casket, its lock prised open and its interior empty and bare. “Pieces of eight!” Fairfax jumped and swore when he cracked his head on the low beams. He reached for the cutlass at his side, eyes searching the source of the cry. He relaxed when he saw an African Grey parrot perched near the head of the cot, which was quite a prize. A talking parrot could fetch a pretty penny in the markets. A strange scent caught his attention. Orange blossom? This far from shore? He wrinkled his nose, turning his head from side to side. There. By the casket. White powder on the floor. And there, scuffed in the dust, a pair of boot prints. Fairfax turned and went back outside. Roberts was pacing the quarterdeck, his dark brows furrowed. The crew busied themselves in the waist, out of earshot of the quarterdeck, desperate to avoid catching the captain’s eye when he was in one of his black moods. “Well, have ye found ‘em yet,” he snapped. “Not yet,” said Fairfax. “Do you know what was in the casket?” “Of course I know. A necklace of diamonds and rubies. Lots of them. And two earrings to match. Made by the very jeweler to Queen Anne herself. Worth a king’s ransom. The fool tried to buy his freedom with those jewels.” Roberts shook his head, “As if we wouldn’t just take what we want anyway.” “And when did you last see them?” asked Fairfax. “Just before I rowed back to the Ranger,” said Roberts. “That was about two hours ago. And in that time, someone’s been a-thievin’. Find out who went into the cabin, and who stole the necklace, Quartermaster. And do it quickly. I ain’t a patient man!” Rapid enquiries amongst the fearful crew revealed that four men had been in the cabin in the captain’s absence. Fairfax sat in the chair in the captain’s cabin and called them in one by one. “I ain’t no thief,” said Mr Arbuthnot, the ship’s carpenter. “I came in ‘ere to check for structural damage from the dustup, so I did. And when I ain’t found none, I left.” “And yet the casket was broken into and a necklace stolen,” said Fairfax. “Child’s play for a man with your skills. And tools.” “I’m tellin’ you, it weren’t me,” bridled Arbuthnot. A shrill squawk rent the air. “Pretty necklace. Pretty necklace.” Both men glanced at the African parrot. “Mine. Mine.” “Will that be all?” asked the carpenter. Fairfax nodded and Arbuthnot levered himself out of the chair and stepped out of the cabin, his wooden leg thumping on the deck with each step. A timid boy, barely fourteen-years-old, took his place. “What were you doing in this cabin, Will?” “Looking for new shirts for the captain, Mr Fairfax, sir.” Will held his neckerchief in his hands and twisted it. “I done nothing wrong.” “New shirts?” “Aye,\" said Will. “The captain, he keeps getting sword cuts in his good silk shirts. I was looking to see if there were any here.” “And did you find any?” “No sir. The captain came back, yelled at me to hurry up or I’d miss the boat back to the Ranger. Startled me something awful, he did.” “And after he startled you, what did you do then?” “Went straight out the door just behind the captain,” said Will. “It ain't wise to keep the captain waiting.” “So you didn’t steal the necklace?” “Oh no sir. I’m a pirate,” said the boy, his chest puffed out. “I would never break the Code.” Feeling thoroughly confused, Fairfax waved Will out of the office. Will ushered in Nehemiah, assistant to the ship’s cook. “So Nehemiah, what were you doing in this cabin?” Nehemiah didn’t say a word. “Please sir, he can’t speak, sir – his tongue was cut out by the Yoruba.” “Of course, Will. Thank you. You may go.” Will left. Fairfax asked his question again. “What were you doing in the cabin? Nehemiah mimed carrying a platter. “You were bringing the captain his dinner?” Nehemiah shook his head, side to side. “No? You were clearing up after his dinner?” Nehemiah nodded. The parrot squawked, “Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly.” “And you didn’t steal the necklace?” Nehemiah shook his head, and moved his hands in an emphatically negative gesture. At a loss for further questions, Fairfax ran his fingers through sun-bleached hair and waved him out of the room. “Elijah!” boomed Bosun Ridley as he came in, stooping low under the beams. “Pretty mess we’ve got here.” “You can say that again,” said Fairfax, “Captain’s riled, crew’s upset, all because of one rotten apple in the barrel.” “Well you can’t think it was me, can you?” laughed the bosun. “Sacrifice my position just for a necklace and a pair of diamond earrings? I’ve got more sense.” “What were you doing in the cabin anyway,” asked Fairfax. “I’d have thought you’d have been busy re-reeving the rigging.” “Captain asked me to sail this ‘ere Jackdaw to Devil’s Island for a refit. Just wanted to check if this lubberly captain carried charts and instruments. Always best to be prepared, that’s my motto.” “So it wasn’t you.” “Swear on me grandma’s grave, gawd bless ‘er,” said Ridley. “Anything else, cos I’ve got to get moving smartly if I’m gonna have Jackdaw ready to sail by dark.” Captain Roberts stormed in. “You found me a man to maroon yet, Fairfax?” “Not quite. I have one question for you. Did Will go over to the Ranger with you?” “Aye. He’s a dullard, that one. I had to come back ‘ere to fetch him. He knocked all that powder on the floor and I had to drag ‘im out with me to make sure he didn’t get left behind.” “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,” sang the parrot. And suddenly Fairfax knew who the culprit was.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What actually happened first  \n  • Cabin-boy Will knocked over a container of flour (the white powder) while the Captain was hurrying him out of the cabin.  \n  • That means the thin layer of powder was already on the deck before the thief approached the casket.  \n  • Any footprints in that powder therefore belong to whoever came in after Will and before the theft.  \n\n2. The footprints  \n  • Fairfax saw a complete pair of BOOT prints.  \n  • Mr Arbuthnot has only one boot – the other “foot” is a wooden peg.  He cannot have left two matching boot prints.  \n  • Nehemiah normally works in the galley barefoot or in soft galley shoes, not in heavy boots, and in any case the prints were clearly boots.  \n  • Will was already back on the Ranger with the Captain, so he could not have left them.  \n  • That leaves only two men known to wear a pair of sea-boots: Bosun Ridley and Captain Roberts himself.\n\n3. The parrot’s evidence  \n  • Parrots repeat what they have just heard.  Earlier it was crying “Pretty necklace.  Mine, mine.”  That must have been said by the thief while he was alone with the bird.  \n  • Nehemiah cannot speak (his tongue was cut out).  He could not have supplied the words.  \n  • Mr Arbuthnot spoke little and stumped straight out – Fairfax heard him himself.  \n  • Ridley never used those words in Fairfax’s hearing, and the parrot did NOT react when Ridley entered.  \n  • When Captain Roberts strode in, the parrot instantly burst into “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!” – an expression the crew know is the Captain’s favourite refrain.  \n  • If the bird associates that song with Roberts, it surely picked up “Pretty necklace, mine” from the same man a short while earlier.\n\n4. The scent of orange blossom  \n  • Perfumed orange-flower water was fashionable with gentlemen but almost unknown among ordinary hands.  \n  • The only man in the ship’s company who habitually wears scent is the flamboyant Captain himself, not the tar-spattered bosun.\n\n5. The Captain’s slip  \n  • Roberts says he returned to the Jackdaw only to fetch Will after the powder was spilt – yet the only footprints in that powder were the thief’s.  \n  • Therefore Roberts walked right across it to the casket, leaving the prints Fairfax saw.\n\n6. Motive  \n  • By taking the necklace secretly, the Captain could avoid sharing it out under the Pirate Code and keep a “king’s ransom” for himself.\n\nPutting those strands together, Fairfax realises the guilty man is his own captain, Bartholomew Roberts.  He dare not say so aloud – but we, the readers, can.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCaptain Bartholomew Roberts, Bosun Ezekiel Ridley, Mr Isaac Arbuthnot, Nehemiah (cook’s mate), Will Preece (cabin-boy)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nCaptain Bartholomew “Black Bart” Roberts\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  The casket containing the necklace lay on the Jackdaw’s captain’s chest.  \n•  Captain Roberts inspected his prize, locked the casket and prepared to return to his flagship Ranger.  \n•  Will, searching for shirts, upset a tin of flour; a fine white dust spread across the deck.  \n•  Roberts hustled the boy out to the boat, promising to come back and “root out the thief” later.  \n•  Realising that, once divided under the Code, the necklace would bring him only a fraction of its worth, Roberts slipped back into the vacant cabin.  \n•  Perfumed with his customary orange-flower water, he crossed the flour-covered deck, leaving two clear boot prints, levered off the casket’s lock with his sword-hilt and pocketed the jewels.  \n•  The African Grey, amused, listened to him mutter, “Pretty necklace… mine, mine,” and memorised the words.  \n•  Roberts re-embarked for the Ranger, summoned Fairfax and the crew and put on a show of outrage, confident no-one would accuse the captain himself.  \n•  But the undisturbed pair of boot prints, the impossibility of Arbuthnot’s peg-leg, Nehemiah’s muteness, Will’s absence and the parrot’s spontaneous greeting unmasked him to Fairfax – if to no one else.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mr Arbuthnot – could not leave TWO boot prints; his peg-leg would have left only one.  \n• Will – removed to the Ranger by the Captain before the theft, so had no opportunity.  \n• Nehemiah – cannot speak; yet the parrot learned the thief’s words.  His usual bare or soft-shod feet do not match the boot prints.  \n• Bosun Ridley – owns two boots but the parrot never echoed any of his sayings, and he uses no orange-flower scent; moreover his charts search gave him no reason to approach the casket.  The prints in the powder matched the Captain’s boots, not Ridley’s.  \nOnly Captain Roberts had motive, opportunity, a voice the parrot could mimic, two booted feet, the scent of orange blossom – and powder-rimmed footprints proving he was at the casket after the flour was spilled.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

The fool tried to buy his freedom with those jewels.” Roberts shook his head, “As if we wouldn’t just take what we want anyway.” “And when did you last see them?” asked Fairfax. “Just before I rowed back to the Ranger,” said Roberts. “That was about two hours ago. And in that time, someone’s been a-thievin’. Find out who went into the cabin, and who stole the necklace, Quartermaster. And do it quickly. I ain’t a patient man!” Rapid enquiries amongst the fearful crew revealed that four men had been in the cabin in the captain’s absence. Fairfax sat in the chair in the captain’s cabin and called them in one by one. “I ain’t no thief,” said Mr Arbuthnot, the ship’s carpenter. “I came in ‘ere to check for structural damage from the dustup, so I did. And when I ain’t found none, I left.” “And yet the casket was broken into and a necklace stolen,” said Fairfax. “Child’s play for a man with your skills. And tools.” “I’m tellin’ you, it weren’t me,” bridled Arbuthnot. A shrill squawk rent the air. “Pretty necklace. Pretty necklace.” Both men glanced at the African parrot. “Mine. Mine.” “Will that be all?” asked the carpenter. Fairfax nodded and Arbuthnot levered himself out of the chair and stepped out of the cabin, his wooden leg thumping on the deck with each step. A timid boy, barely fourteen-years-old, took his place. “What were you doing in this cabin, Will?” “Looking for new shirts for the captain, Mr Fairfax, sir.” Will held his neckerchief in his hands and twisted it. “I done nothing wrong.” “New shirts?” “Aye,\" said Will. “The captain, he keeps getting sword cuts in his good silk shirts. I was looking to see if there were any here.” “And did you find any?” “No sir. The captain came back, yelled at me to hurry up or I’d miss the boat back to the Ranger. Startled me something awful, he did.” “And after he startled you, what did you do then?” “Went straight out the door just behind the captain,” said Will. “It ain't wise to keep the captain waiting.” “So you didn’t steal the necklace?” “Oh no sir. I’m a pirate,” said the boy, his chest puffed out. “I would never break the Code.” Feeling thoroughly confused, Fairfax waved Will out of the office. Will ushered in Nehemiah, assistant to the ship’s cook. “So Nehemiah, what were you doing in this cabin?” Nehemiah didn’t say a word. “Please sir, he can’t speak, sir – his tongue was cut out by the Yoruba.” “Of course, Will. Thank you. You may go.” Will left. Fairfax asked his question again. “What were you doing in the cabin? Nehemiah mimed carrying a platter. “You were bringing the captain his dinner?” Nehemiah shook his head, side to side. “No? You were clearing up after his dinner?” Nehemiah nodded. The parrot squawked, “Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly.” “And you didn’t steal the necklace?” Nehemiah shook his head, and moved his hands in an emphatically negative gesture. At a loss for further questions, Fairfax ran his fingers through sun-bleached hair and waved him out of the room. “Elijah!” boomed Bosun Ridley as he came in, stooping low under the beams. “Pretty mess we’ve got here.” “You can say that again,” said Fairfax, “Captain’s riled, crew’s upset, all because of one rotten apple in the barrel.” “Well you can’t think it was me, can you?” laughed the bosun. “Sacrifice my position just for a necklace and a pair of diamond earrings? I’ve got more sense.” “What were you doing in the cabin anyway,” asked Fairfax. “I’d have thought you’d have been busy re-reeving the rigging.” “Captain asked me to sail this ‘ere Jackdaw to Devil’s Island for a refit. Just wanted to check if this lubberly captain carried charts and instruments. Always best to be prepared, that’s my motto.” “So it wasn’t you.” “Swear on me grandma’s grave, gawd bless ‘er,” said Ridley. “Anything else, cos I’ve got to get moving smartly if I’m gonna have Jackdaw ready to sail by dark.” Captain Roberts stormed in. “You found me a man to maroon yet, Fairfax?” “Not quite. I have one question for you. Did Will go over to the Ranger with you?” “Aye. He’s a dullard, that one. I had to come back ‘ere to fetch him. He knocked all that powder on the floor and I had to drag ‘im out with me to make sure he didn’t get left behind.” “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,” sang the parrot. And suddenly Fairfax knew who the culprit was.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Bosun Ridley; (b) Mr Arbuthnot; (c) Nehemiah; (d) Will",
      "answer": "(a) Bosun Ridley",
      "outcome": "Mr Arbuthnot is innocent. He has a wooden leg and could not have left two boot prints in the wig powder on the floor.\nNehemiah is also innocent. The parrot repeats the burglar's satisfaction with his ill-gotten gains, and Nehemiah is mute.\nIt could not be Will. The captain had to hurry him out of the cabin straight after he spilled the powder, before the boot prints were left there.\nBosun Ridley is guilty. The parrot mimicked his satisfaction at having stolen the necklace and he had plenty of time in the cabin while searching for charts and navigation instruments. But the real giveaway is that only the captain and Fairfax knew the stolen items had included earrings. When Bosun Ridley mentioned this, he sentenced himself to being marooned on an island with nothing but a flask of water and a pistol with a single bullet."
