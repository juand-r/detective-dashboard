    "full_text": "I got the call from an excited Lawrence Horton at about 1:30 on Monday afternoon. Horton, an old movies fan, is the owner of The Blue Parrot Restaurant, which is not far from the newspaper where I work, for too little money, as Food and Wine Editor. “Come right over. I need your help. Right now! Before this news gets all over town.” He sounded desperate, like a heart attack ready to happen. I raced down the street and was there within a few minutes. Horton waved me into his office, and introduced me to a patron, William Saunders. “Yes,” Saunders said, “I read your column. You know your food and wines. So you’ll appreciate that I don’t like paying hundreds of dollars for what I did not order! My wife Caroline and I were celebrating our anniversary. We ordered a special meal, steaks with black mushrooms. That’s what we got. But when I checked the credit card, it was for the truffles, at three times the cost of the meal we actually had! We came here on your recommendation, too!” That made it personal. I was startled. After all, I had just run a special article on The Blue Parrot, which featured this very dish. Truffles were rare and expensive. I had never tried the black truffles from France or the equally expensive and rare white ones from Italy. That is, I had never tried them before the special tasting Mr. Horton set up before my column. He had an order, and so did I. Their cost was high -- reaching $1,500 a pound. These truffles grew randomly underground, and were difficult to find. They were usually found by specially trained dogs, or even pigs, which traced the truffle scent! They gave food an unforgettable flavor, rich with a touch of garlic. So tasting the real thing was a rare event, and charging for it without serving the dish was grand larceny. “Show me where this happened,” I said. “And please try to keep the noise down,” Horton added. “This’ll get sorted out, I’m sure,” he added, trying to reassure both Saunders and himself. “Believe me, you won’t have to pay for anything that you didn’t order.” Saunders shook his head in an I-told-you-so affirmation. I turned to Horton. “I want to see everyone involved in the service.” Horton summoned the waiter, Antoine, and the head waiter, Georges Monceau. “What is the serving procedure?” My question was directed at the headwaiter, who was also in charge of wines. Monceau answered crisply. Clearly he was a man who knew his business. “I deliver the menus, both the wine and also the food menu, if Sally Horvats has not already done so. I then offer to be of any assistance. Sometimes I even get the orders, when there is a rush. Actually, Mr. Saunders is a very knowledgeable consumer, and something of a wine authority in his own right. He will sometimes check with me about a special dish or a vintage year. But this was a special occasion. He had already made up his mind that he wanted the steak with black mushroom sauce, and he ordered it and was served promptly, so no special assistance was needed from me.” Saunders nodded in agreement. “What happened then?” Antoine answered: “I gave the order to the chef, Sam Wheeler, and when the order was ready, I served it immediately to the customer.” Monceau nodded in agreement. “Then, I opened and served his wine, after the customer checked the label. After that, I would check back from time to time, to see if everything was all right. It seemed to be, and Mr. Saunders left his typical generous cash tip. Though, he was in a hurry to leave when he finished his meal. He just picked up his credit card and left.” Antoine smiled in agreement. We all went into the kitchen. Horton introduced us to Sam Wheeler, a beefy man wearing a large, white chef’s apron and cap. “Tell us about the truffle service,” I said. “Just take us through your routine.” Sam Wheeler grunted a bit. “Those are special orders,” he began. “By that, I mean that each is cooked to order, never prepared in advance. Truffles are not cooked very long. If they were, they might lose some of the flavor that the customer is paying such a premium for,” he said.\n\t\n“Show me the truffles.”\n\t\nHe pointed to a medium-sized jar. I picked it up. It was a French import from a famous and respected shipping house. “We had just two jars,” he said, pointing to a hall-full jar: “I cook in front of the entire staff, they know we used one jar last week, and this is what remains from the second jar -- after three orders today. We’ll run out entirely soon.” “How many orders can you make per jar?” “ … About six.” “Do you get many orders for steak with black mushrooms?” “Sure, plenty of them. It’s something of a specialty here. A good dish, certainly. But not the same as steak and truffles!” “Have you cooked truffles before?” I asked. He bristled a bit, but admitted that he had seen it done when he was in culinary school, but had never before done it himself. They were just too expensive for student chefs to handle. “Could there be a mistake, with one dish ordered and the wrong one served?” “Absolutely not,” he said. “Also, I never serve the two together in the same dish. If the customer ordered steak with truffle sauce, and got mushrooms instead, there has been either a mistake or a crime.” They were stunned. We left the kitchen, and Antoine and Georges Manceau went back to their stations. Saunders left, somewhat pacified that the matter was being closely investigated. I took Horton aside and asked to see the daily receipts. He introduced Sally Horvats, the hostess who doubled as cashier. A troubled-looking brunette, she came over at Horton’s nod. “No, I really didn’t see anything,” she said. “It was a busy day, and there was just time to seat Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and give them their food menus. And then some more customers appeared at the front door, and I had to go and greet them.” She was nervous, and I remembered why. Horton had told me that she was on parole for petty larceny. He was giving her a chance to redeem herself, a chance that, over the last six months, had seemed justified. “That’s right,” Horton said. “She was on duty all last week, but couldn’t have been at any table more than a couple of minutes.” A new thought came to me. “How about the day’s receipts, Mr. Horton? And last week’s too, while you’re at it.” We went to his office. Everything seemed to be in order. There were three orders for today, and six orders of the special truffled steaks for last week, including the order for the Saunders luncheon, and there were also six credit card duplicates for those orders. “So it was just a mistake after all,” Horton said. “This proves it.” I thought for a minute. “No, Mr. Horton. It was grand larceny. I know who switched the orders,” I said.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What exactly happened?  \n   •  Saunders and his wife ordered the ordinary “steak with black-mushroom sauce”.  \n   •  Their credit-card slip, however, shows the far more expensive “steak with truffles”.  \n   •  Therefore somebody knowingly substituted one dish for the other – a crime Horton himself calls “grand larceny”.\n\n2. Who could do that?  \n   •  Only someone who both (a) controls what finally reaches the table and (b) can see, or later alter, what is written on the check.  \n   •  The possible actors are:  \n        –  Sam Wheeler, chef  \n        –  Antoine, waiter  \n        –  Georges Monceau, head-waiter / wine steward  \n        –  Sally Horvats, hostess / cashier  \n        –  Lawrence Horton, owner\n\n3. Key physical evidence – the jar of “truffles”.  \n   •  Wheeler says one jar was used up last week (six orders) and that the half-full jar in his hand is the second jar, partly used for three orders at lunch-time today.  \n   •  The day-book Horton shows has six truffle orders for last week and three for today – the numbers match Wheeler’s story.  \n\n   BUT … the narrator is a food-and-wine editor who tasted true French black truffles only a week before – he knows their smell, texture and appearance.  \n   •  When he lifts the jar he gets no distinctive garlicky aroma at all.  \n   •  The pieces floating in the liquid are quite obviously ordinary black mushrooms, not the priceless fungus.  \n   Therefore Wheeler’s “second jar of truffles” is a fake.  The real truffles have vanished.\n\n4. Logical consequences of the fake jar.  \n   •  No one out in the dining-room ever touches that jar; only the chef has routine access to it.  \n   •  If the jar in the kitchen contains mushrooms, every “truffle” dish prepared since last week contained mushrooms.  \n   •  So the guest’s complaint is perfectly true, and the only person with both opportunity and motive to switch the contents of the jar (and then keep charging the restaurant for “truffle” dishes) is Sam Wheeler.  \n   •  The receipts Horton shows do not “prove it was a mistake”; they merely prove that nine truffle-priced meals have been rung up.  They also prove that nine genuine truffle meals should have reduced the two jars to zero – yet half a jar still appears to exist.  That half-jar is worthless mushroom, so the real truffles were stolen and replaced.\n\n5. Motive.  \n   •  At roughly $1,500 a pound, one jar of truffles (about half a pound) is worth several hundred dollars.  \n   •  Wheeler admits he had never before handled truffles; he realised their value and quietly substituted inexpensive black mushrooms, then either sold or kept the truffles.  By continuing to prepare dishes with the substitute he disguised the theft while the restaurant—and its customers—paid full price.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSam Wheeler, Antoine, Georges Monceau, Sally Horvats, Lawrence Horton\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nSam Wheeler\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly last week the Blue Parrot received two sealed jars of costly French black truffles.  \nChef Sam Wheeler opened the first jar to prepare a tasting for the newspaper columnist.  Recognising the street value of the fungus, he decided to steal it.  He removed all the true truffles from the second jar (and what remained of the first) and took them home to sell.  To avoid instant detection he refilled the second jar with cheap canned black mushrooms, poured the original preserving liquid back on top, and returned the jar to its shelf.\n\nEach time a waiter ordered “steak with truffles” Wheeler cooked the steak, added a few slices from his mushroom jar, and sent the plate out.  The smell and taste of real truffle were absent, but most diners had never eaten truffles before and did not notice.  William Saunders, however, had not ordered truffles; he had ordered the much cheaper steak-and-mushrooms, so when he later saw a truffle price on his credit-card slip he complained.\n\nBy Monday afternoon Wheeler had rung up nine “truffle” meals, but the jar in the kitchen was still half-full because it contained nothing but mushrooms.  The columnist instantly recognised the imposture, compared the apparent stock with the receipts, and realised the genuine truffles had disappeared.  Since only the chef had access to the jar, he alone could have carried out the substitution.  Wheeler was guilty of grand larceny, the switch of orders being merely the symptom of his larger theft.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Antoine (waiter) – He merely took the order and served what the chef handed him.  He never enters the kitchen stores and could not have replaced the truffles with mushrooms.  His only possible gain would have been a slightly larger tip, far smaller than the value of the stolen truffles.\n\n•  Georges Monceau (head-waiter) – He handles menus and wine, not kitchen supplies.  He has no occasion to tamper with the sealed jars and no direct access to them during service.\n\n•  Sally Horvats (cashier) – She can ring up whatever the waiter writes, but changing a price on a credit-card slip sends the extra money to the restaurant, not into her pocket.  More importantly, she never goes near the truffle jars; the physical theft is beyond her reach.\n\n•  Lawrence Horton (owner) – He purchased the truffles to publicise his restaurant.  Stealing them himself would wreck his investment and invite scandal.  He, too, had no hands-on contact with the jars after delivery.\n\nOnly Sam Wheeler had motive, means and opportunity: he alone possessed the truffles long enough to substitute mushrooms, and he alone profited by selling—or keeping—the real thing.  Hence he is the sole culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

She was in charge of processing credit card charges. She recognized a rich repeat customer, and thought that he would not notice that he was billed for the more expensive meal, when she switched a credit card charge for the actual one that he had signed, putting it through after he had left the restaurant.\nThere were six orders served the previous week, from the full jar of truffles that was used up. Two of them however were served to Mr. Horton, the restaurant owner, and to the narrator. Therefore, only four orders should have been charged. The two further orders that were charged to the Saunders credit card by Sally Horvats were her attempt to make some easy money. Her scheme landed her back in prison instead.",

He had already made up his mind that he wanted the steak with black mushroom sauce, and he ordered it and was served promptly, so no special assistance was needed from me.” Saunders nodded in agreement. “What happened then?” Antoine answered: “I gave the order to the chef, Sam Wheeler, and when the order was ready, I served it immediately to the customer.” Monceau nodded in agreement. “Then, I opened and served his wine, after the customer checked the label. After that, I would check back from time to time, to see if everything was all right. It seemed to be, and Mr. Saunders left his typical generous cash tip. Though, he was in a hurry to leave when he finished his meal. He just picked up his credit card and left.” Antoine smiled in agreement. We all went into the kitchen. Horton introduced us to Sam Wheeler, a beefy man wearing a large, white chef’s apron and cap. “Tell us about the truffle service,” I said. “Just take us through your routine.” Sam Wheeler grunted a bit. “Those are special orders,” he began. “By that, I mean that each is cooked to order, never prepared in advance. Truffles are not cooked very long. If they were, they might lose some of the flavor that the customer is paying such a premium for,” he said.\n\t\n“Show me the truffles.”\n\t\nHe pointed to a medium-sized jar. I picked it up. It was a French import from a famous and respected shipping house. “We had just two jars,” he said, pointing to a hall-full jar: “I cook in front of the entire staff, they know we used one jar last week, and this is what remains from the second jar -- after three orders today. We’ll run out entirely soon.” “How many orders can you make per jar?” “ … About six.” “Do you get many orders for steak with black mushrooms?” “Sure, plenty of them. It’s something of a specialty here. A good dish, certainly. But not the same as steak and truffles!” “Have you cooked truffles before?” I asked. He bristled a bit, but admitted that he had seen it done when he was in culinary school, but had never before done it himself. They were just too expensive for student chefs to handle. “Could there be a mistake, with one dish ordered and the wrong one served?” “Absolutely not,” he said. “Also, I never serve the two together in the same dish. If the customer ordered steak with truffle sauce, and got mushrooms instead, there has been either a mistake or a crime.” They were stunned. We left the kitchen, and Antoine and Georges Manceau went back to their stations. Saunders left, somewhat pacified that the matter was being closely investigated. I took Horton aside and asked to see the daily receipts. He introduced Sally Horvats, the hostess who doubled as cashier. A troubled-looking brunette, she came over at Horton’s nod. “No, I really didn’t see anything,” she said. “It was a busy day, and there was just time to seat Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and give them their food menus. And then some more customers appeared at the front door, and I had to go and greet them.” She was nervous, and I remembered why. Horton had told me that she was on parole for petty larceny. He was giving her a chance to redeem herself, a chance that, over the last six months, had seemed justified. “That’s right,” Horton said. “She was on duty all last week, but couldn’t have been at any table more than a couple of minutes.” A new thought came to me. “How about the day’s receipts, Mr. Horton? And last week’s too, while you’re at it.” We went to his office. Everything seemed to be in order. There were three orders for today, and six orders of the special truffled steaks for last week, including the order for the Saunders luncheon, and there were also six credit card duplicates for those orders. “So it was just a mistake after all,” Horton said. “This proves it.” I thought for a minute. “No, Mr. Horton. It was grand larceny. I know who switched the orders,” I said.",

      "answer": "(c) Sally Horvats",
      "outcome": "Sam Wheeler made the truffle dish in plain sight of the kitchen and staff. Truffles and black mushrooms were never on the same dish. A waiter seeing an error would have pointed it out to the chef.\nAntoine the waiter had no opportunity to switch truffles for black mushrooms. He merely picked up the plate and delivered it promptly to the customer. Georges Monceau, the head waiter, never touched the order.\nSally Horvats, the cashier, is guilty. She was in charge of processing credit card charges. She recognized a rich repeat customer, and thought that he would not notice that he was billed for the more expensive meal, when she switched a credit card charge for the actual one that he had signed, putting it through after he had left the restaurant.\nThere were six orders served the previous week, from the full jar of truffles that was used up. Two of them however were served to Mr. Horton, the restaurant owner, and to the narrator. Therefore, only four orders should have been charged. The two further orders that were charged to the Saunders credit card by Sally Horvats were her attempt to make some easy money. Her scheme landed her back in prison instead."
