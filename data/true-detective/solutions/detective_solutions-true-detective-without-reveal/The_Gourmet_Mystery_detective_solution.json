    "full_text": "I got the call from an excited Lawrence Horton at about 1:30 on Monday afternoon. Horton, an old movies fan, is the owner of The Blue Parrot Restaurant, which is not far from the newspaper where I work, for too little money, as Food and Wine Editor. “Come right over. I need your help. Right now! Before this news gets all over town.” He sounded desperate, like a heart attack ready to happen. I raced down the street and was there within a few minutes. Horton waved me into his office, and introduced me to a patron, William Saunders. “Yes,” Saunders said, “I read your column. You know your food and wines. So you’ll appreciate that I don’t like paying hundreds of dollars for what I did not order! My wife Caroline and I were celebrating our anniversary. We ordered a special meal, steaks with black mushrooms. That’s what we got. But when I checked the credit card, it was for the truffles, at three times the cost of the meal we actually had! We came here on your recommendation, too!” That made it personal. I was startled. After all, I had just run a special article on The Blue Parrot, which featured this very dish. Truffles were rare and expensive. I had never tried the black truffles from France or the equally expensive and rare white ones from Italy. That is, I had never tried them before the special tasting Mr. Horton set up before my column. He had an order, and so did I. Their cost was high -- reaching $1,500 a pound. These truffles grew randomly underground, and were difficult to find. They were usually found by specially trained dogs, or even pigs, which traced the truffle scent! They gave food an unforgettable flavor, rich with a touch of garlic. So tasting the real thing was a rare event, and charging for it without serving the dish was grand larceny. “Show me where this happened,” I said. “And please try to keep the noise down,” Horton added. “This’ll get sorted out, I’m sure,” he added, trying to reassure both Saunders and himself. “Believe me, you won’t have to pay for anything that you didn’t order.” Saunders shook his head in an I-told-you-so affirmation. I turned to Horton. “I want to see everyone involved in the service.” Horton summoned the waiter, Antoine, and the head waiter, Georges Monceau. “What is the serving procedure?” My question was directed at the headwaiter, who was also in charge of wines. Monceau answered crisply. Clearly he was a man who knew his business. “I deliver the menus, both the wine and also the food menu, if Sally Horvats has not already done so. I then offer to be of any assistance. Sometimes I even get the orders, when there is a rush. Actually, Mr. Saunders is a very knowledgeable consumer, and something of a wine authority in his own right. He will sometimes check with me about a special dish or a vintage year. But this was a special occasion. He had already made up his mind that he wanted the steak with black mushroom sauce, and he ordered it and was served promptly, so no special assistance was needed from me.” Saunders nodded in agreement. “What happened then?” Antoine answered: “I gave the order to the chef, Sam Wheeler, and when the order was ready, I served it immediately to the customer.” Monceau nodded in agreement. “Then, I opened and served his wine, after the customer checked the label. After that, I would check back from time to time, to see if everything was all right. It seemed to be, and Mr. Saunders left his typical generous cash tip. Though, he was in a hurry to leave when he finished his meal. He just picked up his credit card and left.” Antoine smiled in agreement. We all went into the kitchen. Horton introduced us to Sam Wheeler, a beefy man wearing a large, white chef’s apron and cap. “Tell us about the truffle service,” I said. “Just take us through your routine.” Sam Wheeler grunted a bit. “Those are special orders,” he began. “By that, I mean that each is cooked to order, never prepared in advance. Truffles are not cooked very long. If they were, they might lose some of the flavor that the customer is paying such a premium for,” he said.\n\t\n“Show me the truffles.”\n\t\nHe pointed to a medium-sized jar. I picked it up. It was a French import from a famous and respected shipping house. “We had just two jars,” he said, pointing to a hall-full jar: “I cook in front of the entire staff, they know we used one jar last week, and this is what remains from the second jar -- after three orders today. We’ll run out entirely soon.” “How many orders can you make per jar?” “ … About six.” “Do you get many orders for steak with black mushrooms?” “Sure, plenty of them. It’s something of a specialty here. A good dish, certainly. But not the same as steak and truffles!” “Have you cooked truffles before?” I asked. He bristled a bit, but admitted that he had seen it done when he was in culinary school, but had never before done it himself. They were just too expensive for student chefs to handle. “Could there be a mistake, with one dish ordered and the wrong one served?” “Absolutely not,” he said. “Also, I never serve the two together in the same dish. If the customer ordered steak with truffle sauce, and got mushrooms instead, there has been either a mistake or a crime.” They were stunned. We left the kitchen, and Antoine and Georges Manceau went back to their stations. Saunders left, somewhat pacified that the matter was being closely investigated. I took Horton aside and asked to see the daily receipts. He introduced Sally Horvats, the hostess who doubled as cashier. A troubled-looking brunette, she came over at Horton’s nod. “No, I really didn’t see anything,” she said. “It was a busy day, and there was just time to seat Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and give them their food menus. And then some more customers appeared at the front door, and I had to go and greet them.” She was nervous, and I remembered why. Horton had told me that she was on parole for petty larceny. He was giving her a chance to redeem herself, a chance that, over the last six months, had seemed justified. “That’s right,” Horton said. “She was on duty all last week, but couldn’t have been at any table more than a couple of minutes.” A new thought came to me. “How about the day’s receipts, Mr. Horton? And last week’s too, while you’re at it.” We went to his office. Everything seemed to be in order. There were three orders for today, and six orders of the special truffled steaks for last week, including the order for the Saunders luncheon, and there were also six credit card duplicates for those orders. “So it was just a mistake after all,” Horton said. “This proves it.” I thought for a minute. “No, Mr. Horton. It was grand larceny. I know who switched the orders,” I said.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What crime really occurred?  \n   The customer (William Saunders) ordered and was served an ordinary “steak with black mushrooms” but his credit-card was run through for the far more expensive “steak with truffles”.  Somebody had deliberately substituted one order for the other on the bill – grand larceny.\n\n2. Who could do that?  \n   • The substitution can be made only by the person who (a) decides what goes to the kitchen and (b) decides what price is finally rung up.  \n   • The cashier/hostess merely takes the printed ticket from the wait-station and runs the card; she never changes the food codes.  \n   • The waiter or the head-waiter can change a food code in the POS system, but they have no reason to do so – the extra money goes into the owner’s accounts, not into their pockets.  \n   • The only person who profits directly from the switch is the one who can keep the truffles he does not serve.  That can only be the chef: he alone handles the jars.\n\n3. The crucial accounting clue.  \n   Two jars of truffles were bought.  Each jar makes “about six” orders.  \n   a) Before last week the owner and I had a special tasting – two truffle orders.  \n   b) The paper slip-file shows SIX “truffle” orders last week (Saunders’ bill is one of them).  \n   c) Today, by one-thirty in the afternoon, THREE more “truffle” orders have been rung up and Sam Wheeler shows a second jar already half-empty.  \n\n   Total truffle orders that Sam Wheeler claims to have cooked:  \n        2 (tasting) + 6 (last week) + 3 (today) = 11 orders.  \n   But two jars yield, at most, 12 orders, so only ONE order-portion of truffles should still remain.  \n   Yet Wheeler shows the first jar completely empty and the second jar already half-used after only three meals.  If Saunders never received truffles, one portion is missing from last week as well.\n\n   The numbers do not balance unless the chef is removing truffles from the jars while ringing them up as having been served.  The “switch” therefore had to be made in the kitchen, not at the cash register.\n\n4. Motive, opportunity, means  \n   • Motive – a single ounce of the French black truffle is worth more than a day’s pay for a line-cook.  Stealing one serving at a time is easy money.  \n   • Opportunity – only Sam Wheeler has continuous, unsupervised access to the jars; no waiter or cashier can pocket the actual truffles.  \n   • Means – Wheeler simply tells the waiter “Order up!”, plates the steak with ordinary black mushrooms, keeps the truffles, and lets the POS ticket (which he himself can alter before it reaches the cashier) show “steak with truffles”.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The falsified head-count between portions cooked and portions charged exposes Sam Wheeler as the man who switched the orders.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLawrence Horton, William Saunders, Sam Wheeler, Antoine (the waiter), Georges Monceau, Sally Horvats\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nSam Wheeler\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Mr. and Mrs. Saunders came to The Blue Parrot to celebrate their anniversary.  \n• They ordered the ordinary steak with black-mushroom sauce.  Waiter Antoine wrote the order correctly and took it to the kitchen.  \n• Chef Sam Wheeler, seeing another chance to steal truffles, cooked exactly what the Saunders had requested – the cheaper mushroom dish – but went to the POS terminal and re-coded the order as “steak with truffles”.  \n• Because the bill now showed a truffle entrée the credit-card slip came out at triple the proper price.  The Saunders signed without examining the itemisation and later discovered the over-charge.  \n• Wheeler pocketed the truffles he had not used, adding them to the one serving he had already kept from the week’s business (and perhaps others still).  \n• He explained the missing quantity by claiming that the first jar had been “used up” on six truffle orders the previous week; the paperwork agreed because he himself had entered Saunders’ meal as a truffle dish.  \n• By early Monday only half a jar remained, and it would have balanced perfectly if Wheeler had not been filching servings – the discrepancy that gave him away.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Lawrence Horton (owner) – He loses reputation and a valuable customer; he invited an outside journalist to investigate, something no guilty party would do.  \n• Antoine (waiter) – Wrote and served exactly what was ordered; has no access to the jars and gains nothing from inflating the price (the tip was left in cash).  \n• Georges Monceau (head-waiter) – Handles wines, not kitchen stock.  His only involvement was opening the bottle.  \n• Sally Horvats (cashier/hostess) – Merely runs the amounts already printed on the waiter’s ticket; she never touches the food or the jars.  Her criminal record made her look suspicious, but the shortage is in truffle inventory, not in cash.  \n• William Saunders – The complainant, not an employee; his only role was to expose the fraud.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

She was in charge of processing credit card charges. She recognized a rich repeat customer, and thought that he would not notice that he was billed for the more expensive meal, when she switched a credit card charge for the actual one that he had signed, putting it through after he had left the restaurant.\nThere were six orders served the previous week, from the full jar of truffles that was used up. Two of them however were served to Mr. Horton, the restaurant owner, and to the narrator. Therefore, only four orders should have been charged. The two further orders that were charged to the Saunders credit card by Sally Horvats were her attempt to make some easy money. Her scheme landed her back in prison instead.",

After that, I would check back from time to time, to see if everything was all right. It seemed to be, and Mr. Saunders left his typical generous cash tip. Though, he was in a hurry to leave when he finished his meal. He just picked up his credit card and left.” Antoine smiled in agreement. We all went into the kitchen. Horton introduced us to Sam Wheeler, a beefy man wearing a large, white chef’s apron and cap. “Tell us about the truffle service,” I said. “Just take us through your routine.” Sam Wheeler grunted a bit. “Those are special orders,” he began. “By that, I mean that each is cooked to order, never prepared in advance. Truffles are not cooked very long. If they were, they might lose some of the flavor that the customer is paying such a premium for,” he said.\n\t\n“Show me the truffles.”\n\t\nHe pointed to a medium-sized jar. I picked it up. It was a French import from a famous and respected shipping house. “We had just two jars,” he said, pointing to a hall-full jar: “I cook in front of the entire staff, they know we used one jar last week, and this is what remains from the second jar -- after three orders today. We’ll run out entirely soon.” “How many orders can you make per jar?” “ … About six.” “Do you get many orders for steak with black mushrooms?” “Sure, plenty of them. It’s something of a specialty here. A good dish, certainly. But not the same as steak and truffles!” “Have you cooked truffles before?” I asked. He bristled a bit, but admitted that he had seen it done when he was in culinary school, but had never before done it himself. They were just too expensive for student chefs to handle. “Could there be a mistake, with one dish ordered and the wrong one served?” “Absolutely not,” he said. “Also, I never serve the two together in the same dish. If the customer ordered steak with truffle sauce, and got mushrooms instead, there has been either a mistake or a crime.” They were stunned. We left the kitchen, and Antoine and Georges Manceau went back to their stations. Saunders left, somewhat pacified that the matter was being closely investigated. I took Horton aside and asked to see the daily receipts. He introduced Sally Horvats, the hostess who doubled as cashier. A troubled-looking brunette, she came over at Horton’s nod. “No, I really didn’t see anything,” she said. “It was a busy day, and there was just time to seat Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and give them their food menus. And then some more customers appeared at the front door, and I had to go and greet them.” She was nervous, and I remembered why. Horton had told me that she was on parole for petty larceny. He was giving her a chance to redeem herself, a chance that, over the last six months, had seemed justified. “That’s right,” Horton said. “She was on duty all last week, but couldn’t have been at any table more than a couple of minutes.” A new thought came to me. “How about the day’s receipts, Mr. Horton? And last week’s too, while you’re at it.” We went to his office. Everything seemed to be in order. There were three orders for today, and six orders of the special truffled steaks for last week, including the order for the Saunders luncheon, and there were also six credit card duplicates for those orders. “So it was just a mistake after all,” Horton said. “This proves it.” I thought for a minute. “No, Mr. Horton. It was grand larceny. I know who switched the orders,” I said.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Antoine; (b) Georges Monceau; (c) Sally Horvats; (d) Sam Wheeler",
      "answer": "(c) Sally Horvats",
      "outcome": "Sam Wheeler made the truffle dish in plain sight of the kitchen and staff. Truffles and black mushrooms were never on the same dish. A waiter seeing an error would have pointed it out to the chef.\nAntoine the waiter had no opportunity to switch truffles for black mushrooms. He merely picked up the plate and delivered it promptly to the customer. Georges Monceau, the head waiter, never touched the order.\nSally Horvats, the cashier, is guilty. She was in charge of processing credit card charges. She recognized a rich repeat customer, and thought that he would not notice that he was billed for the more expensive meal, when she switched a credit card charge for the actual one that he had signed, putting it through after he had left the restaurant.\nThere were six orders served the previous week, from the full jar of truffles that was used up. Two of them however were served to Mr. Horton, the restaurant owner, and to the narrator. Therefore, only four orders should have been charged. The two further orders that were charged to the Saunders credit card by Sally Horvats were her attempt to make some easy money. Her scheme landed her back in prison instead."
