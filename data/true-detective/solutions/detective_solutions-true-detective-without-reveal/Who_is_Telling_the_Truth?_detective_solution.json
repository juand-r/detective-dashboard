    "full_text": "NOTE: The reader should have at least a passing knowledge of American history since the early 1960s to around 1990 to fully appreciate this mystery. Four of the characters in the story are lying and are “exonerated” from telling the truth. The character who is “incriminated” is telling the truth. Terry Brennan was enjoying a glass of wine before dinner with his wife of over 30 years, Rochelle. The early June evening was perfect and, as they relaxed on the spacious outside patio deck, he was explaining to her how much he had enjoyed finding several long lost friends on one of the internet’s many social networking sites. “Since signing up on E-Friends a couple of weeks ago, I have found several of our old chums from the early 1960s.” Terry and Rochelle had known each other since they met in Mrs. Bowden’s afternoon kindergarten class in the fall of 1955. Neither of them liked to be reminded that was almost 54 years ago. Taking a bite of cheese, Rochelle, asked, “So, who have you found?” Terry replied, “So far I’ve become network friends with Billy Flowers, Jane Neal, Paula Newsome, Jimmy Smith and Larry Gerard.” “Why, I remember them well!” exclaimed Rochelle. “But, I haven’t seen or heard from any of them in almost 50 years. When our family moved across town in the summer of 1961, I lost track of all of them.” Terry chuckled, “Well, our family stayed put and I lost track of them too. Friendships change when you enter junior high school.” “True,” Rochelle replied, thoughtfully, “but tell me about them.” Terry poured another glass of wine. He was in a playful mood. “Well, there is much to tell, but since we are relaxed and in no hurry this evening, allow me to relate some of the emails they have sent me. See if you can figure out which one is telling the whole truth. Four of the five old friends I have mentioned have told me some things that, simply put, cannot be 100% accurate.” There was a twinkle in her husband’s eye. Rochelle knew that whatever Terry was about to say, it would be good. She said, “I’m not certain what you are getting at, but start talking.” Terry grinned. He loved a good story and was in his element. Now, he was about to share several of them with his still lovely wife. Life was good, he thought. He began, “Well, I know you and Jane Neal were friends, so I’ll start with her. By the way, I should say before I forget that I purposefully waited until now to tell you about E-Friends. I want you to enjoy this little brainteaser I’ve prepared for you.” Rochelle smiled at Terry, saying, “I’ve already told you to start talking.” “Smiling back, he said, “OK. Jane was the first of our old childhood pals that I found. I sent her a friendship invitation and she readily accepted. In a couple of subsequent emails, she told me that her life has not been a happy one.  Disillusioned by the Vietnam War, she traveled around the country in an old tour bus with a group of Ken Kesey style merry pranksters after high school graduation. But, she had, and still possesses, a serious side. Jane worked very hard on the Robert Kennedy presidential campaign during the summer of 1968 and voted for him in the general election. Nixon’s election threw her into a several year funk. She has been married and divorced several times and has had ongoing problems with drug abuse. Today, she lives in a commune in Idaho, sort of a throwback, retro lifestyle from the 1960s. To end Jane’s story on a high note, she claims to be more at peace with herself now than she has ever been.” Rochelle and Terry were enjoying the wine, cheese and conversation. Rochelle asked, “Who’s next? “Billy Flowers,” replied Terry. I saw him occasionally when we were in high school, but he, as you, moved to a different neighborhood and I mainly saw him in White’s Grocery Store, where I worked part time to pay for that old car I bought. The last time I saw him, I think, was just before the Spring Prom in 1967. He was surprised and pleased to reunite with me on E-Friends, although we were never close friends. His life has been a bit happier than Jane’s although he’s had his ups and downs. He is happily married, has lived in New York since 1975 and has three grown children and three grandchildren. Since moving to New York, his politics have gone from conservative to liberal. Indeed, in the last presidential election before moving to New York, he voted for Barry Goldwater, and then voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976. Quite a shift in political thinking, but I do recall that Billy was always a bit of an open-minded, free spirit.” Rochelle and Terry were in no hurry for dinner as he continued. “Next is Larry Gerard. Larry was in the US State Department for almost 30 years, spending much time abroad. In fact, his two sons still live in London, his last post before retiring. Since 2003, he and his wife Linda have lived in Texas. He spends much of his time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston, doing research for a book he wishes to write on the Johnson presidency. It appears to me that Larry has had the most professional success and happiest personal life of any of those I am speaking of now.” “What about Paula Newsome?” Rochelle asked. “Paula has an interesting story. She was one of the first of our peer group to get lucky financially. After college, she joined the staff of one of the major television networks. Recall the big hoopla over the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1976. During the years 1974-76, she was instrumental in producing the historical Bicentennial Minutes television segments, which ran up until the end of 1976. The series won an Emmy award and her career and reputation were made. Today, she is retired and lives in Los Angeles. She and her husband Alan had one son, who died of cancer in 1988.” Terry paused to catch his breath and sip a little more wine. He and Rochelle were having fun and there was one more story to go. “Jimmy Smith,” he said, “almost died of injuries suffered in a car accident in 1981. A drunk driver in a brand new Ford Taurus T-boned him running through a red light. He spent several weeks in the hospital and many months in physical rehabilitation. I admire what he has done with his life since. He and his second wife Charlene opened their own rehabilitation center and have been physical therapy instructors in Kansas City for over 20 years.” Terry and Rochelle looked at each other in the mischievous ways they both loved. Terry finished his wine and asked, “So, who is telling the truth? Rochelle told her husband who she thought was telling the truth and why. Terry asked, “Would you care to explain your reasoning?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe “crime” Terry sets for Rochelle is simply to discover which one of the five childhood friends is telling the COMPLETE truth.  \nBecause Terry warns her that “four … are lying and are exonerated from telling the truth” while “the character who is incriminated is telling the truth,” the job is to search each e-mail story for a historical or factual impossibility.  \nWhichever résumé contains no error must belong to the single truth-teller – i.e., the “culprit.”\n\nStep-by-step check of each account:\n\n1. Jane Neal  \n   • Says she “worked very hard on the Robert Kennedy presidential campaign during the summer of 1968 and voted for him in the general election.”  \n   • Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on 6 June 1968, three days after winning the California primary.  He never appeared on the November ballot, so no one could have “voted for him in the general election.”  \n   → FALSE STATEMENT → Jane is lying.\n\n2. Billy Flowers  \n   • Claims that in “the last presidential election before moving to New York (1975) he voted for Barry Goldwater, and then voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976.”  \n   • The election immediately preceding a 1975 move would have been 1972 (Nixon vs. McGovern).  Barry Goldwater ran only in 1964.  \n   → IMPOSSIBLE TIMELINE → Billy is lying.\n\n3. Larry Gerard  \n   • Says he spends his retirement “at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston.”  \n   • The LBJ Presidential Library is in Austin, Texas – not Houston.  \n   → GEOGRAPHICAL ERROR → Larry is lying.\n\n4. Jimmy Smith  \n   • Was struck in 1981 by “a drunk driver in a brand new Ford Taurus.”  \n   • The Ford Taurus was not introduced until December 1985 (as a 1986 model).  \n   → AUTOMOTIVE ANACHRONISM → Jimmy is lying.\n\n5. Paula Newsome  \n   • Worked on the CBS “Bicentennial Minutes” segments, which ran nightly from July 1974 until 31 December 1976, a project that did in fact win an Emmy.  \n   • No historical contradiction appears: the dates, network, and award are all accurate; nothing she says is impossible or inconsistent with known fact.  \n   → NO ERROR FOUND → Paula is the only one telling the truth.\n\nThus there are exactly four flawed stories and one flawless story, satisfying Terry’s conditions.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJane Neal, Billy Flowers, Larry Gerard, Paula Newsome, Jimmy Smith\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nPaula Newsome\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nTerry Brennan deliberately inserted one complete, factual life story among four that each carry a historically impossible detail.  \nJane’s impossible vote, Billy’s impossible timeline, Larry’s impossible library location, and Jimmy’s impossible automobile all expose them as liars.  \nPaula’s résumé – participation in CBS’s Emmy-winning “Bicentennial Minutes” between 1974 and 1976 and her later retirement in Los Angeles after a successful television career – contains no such flaw.  Therefore Paula, alone, is telling the unvarnished truth and is thereby “incriminated” under Terry’s playful rules.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJane Neal – Could not have voted for Robert Kennedy in November 1968; her account is historically impossible, so she is dismissed as a liar.  \nBilly Flowers – Claims to have voted for Barry Goldwater in the “last election before moving” in 1975, but Goldwater ran in 1964; the 1972 election would have been the last before a 1975 move, proving his story false.  \nLarry Gerard – Places the LBJ Library in Houston instead of its real location in Austin; his story is demonstrably wrong.  \nJimmy Smith – Says he was hit in 1981 by a “brand new Ford Taurus,” yet the Taurus did not exist until late 1985; his account cannot be true.  \nAll four are therefore “innocent” of telling the truth.  Only Paula’s story survives every factual test, making her the sole truth-teller – the puzzle’s culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Rochelle was now a bit light-headed from the wine and eager for dinner, so she spoke quickly. “Jane was lying. Robert Kennedy was shot on June 5 and died a day later on June 6, 1968. She could not have worked on his campaign all summer and then voted for him in the general election. Billy Flowers was lying, too. He’s another one who doesn’t remember his history right. He could not have voted for Barry Goldwater in 1972. Goldwater ran against Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The same goes for Larry Gerard. The Johnson presidential library is in Austin, not Houston. Now, Jimmy Smith’s story is not political, but he too has his facts wrong. If he was injured in 1981, he could not have been hit by a Ford Taurus. They were not introduced until model year 1986.”\n“So,” Terry said,’ “that leaves Jane.”\n“Yes, it does,” replied Rochelle, who arose from her patio seat to go inside. “She told the truth about the Bicentennial Minutes.

I saw him occasionally when we were in high school, but he, as you, moved to a different neighborhood and I mainly saw him in White’s Grocery Store, where I worked part time to pay for that old car I bought. The last time I saw him, I think, was just before the Spring Prom in 1967. He was surprised and pleased to reunite with me on E-Friends, although we were never close friends. His life has been a bit happier than Jane’s although he’s had his ups and downs. He is happily married, has lived in New York since 1975 and has three grown children and three grandchildren. Since moving to New York, his politics have gone from conservative to liberal. Indeed, in the last presidential election before moving to New York, he voted for Barry Goldwater, and then voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976. Quite a shift in political thinking, but I do recall that Billy was always a bit of an open-minded, free spirit.” Rochelle and Terry were in no hurry for dinner as he continued. “Next is Larry Gerard. Larry was in the US State Department for almost 30 years, spending much time abroad. In fact, his two sons still live in London, his last post before retiring. Since 2003, he and his wife Linda have lived in Texas. He spends much of his time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston, doing research for a book he wishes to write on the Johnson presidency. It appears to me that Larry has had the most professional success and happiest personal life of any of those I am speaking of now.” “What about Paula Newsome?” Rochelle asked. “Paula has an interesting story. She was one of the first of our peer group to get lucky financially. After college, she joined the staff of one of the major television networks. Recall the big hoopla over the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1976. During the years 1974-76, she was instrumental in producing the historical Bicentennial Minutes television segments, which ran up until the end of 1976. The series won an Emmy award and her career and reputation were made. Today, she is retired and lives in Los Angeles. She and her husband Alan had one son, who died of cancer in 1988.” Terry paused to catch his breath and sip a little more wine. He and Rochelle were having fun and there was one more story to go. “Jimmy Smith,” he said, “almost died of injuries suffered in a car accident in 1981. A drunk driver in a brand new Ford Taurus T-boned him running through a red light. He spent several weeks in the hospital and many months in physical rehabilitation. I admire what he has done with his life since. He and his second wife Charlene opened their own rehabilitation center and have been physical therapy instructors in Kansas City for over 20 years.” Terry and Rochelle looked at each other in the mischievous ways they both loved. Terry finished his wine and asked, “So, who is telling the truth? Rochelle told her husband who she thought was telling the truth and why. Terry asked, “Would you care to explain your reasoning?”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Bill Flowers; (b) Jane Neal; (c) Jimmy Smith; (d) Larry Gerard; (e) Paula Newsome",
      "answer": "(e) Paula Newsome",
      "outcome": "Rochelle was now a bit light-headed from the wine and eager for dinner, so she spoke quickly. “Jane was lying. Robert Kennedy was shot on June 5 and died a day later on June 6, 1968. She could not have worked on his campaign all summer and then voted for him in the general election. Billy Flowers was lying, too. He’s another one who doesn’t remember his history right. He could not have voted for Barry Goldwater in 1972. Goldwater ran against Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The same goes for Larry Gerard. The Johnson presidential library is in Austin, not Houston. Now, Jimmy Smith’s story is not political, but he too has his facts wrong. If he was injured in 1981, he could not have been hit by a Ford Taurus. They were not introduced until model year 1986.”\n“So,” Terry said,’ “that leaves Jane.”\n“Yes, it does,” replied Rochelle, who arose from her patio seat to go inside. “She told the truth about the Bicentennial Minutes. They ran from 1974-76 and won an Emmy during the last year. That’s how she became wealthy and well known.”"
