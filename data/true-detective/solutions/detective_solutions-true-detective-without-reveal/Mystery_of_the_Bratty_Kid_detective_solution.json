    "full_text": "My brother swears it's true. \"The Wellingtons are wealthy. That's how I remembered it.\" And when he'd first showed up, their son was pushing a little girl into the pool. \"Was it deliberate?\" \"Oh, absolutely. She was shaking some water out of her ear, and Percy J. Wellington just rushed up behind her and shoved her over the edge.\" \"Why would he do that?\" \"Because he was a brat.\" Mr. Wellington wasn't there. He'd hired my brother, a detective, to provide security for the party that Mrs. Wellington was giving her seven-year-old stepson. But I couldn't believe Percy was as rotten as my brother claimed. \"This was the brattiest kid in the world -- literally,\" he said. \"That's what everyone called him.\" He opened a drawer in his desk and pulled out a copy of People magazine from four years ago. He flicked through its stories about celebrities like Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears until he'd found the story he was looking for, and showed me its headline. \"Percy J. Wellington: The Brattiest Kid in the World.\" Scanning the article, I started to believe. There was a picture of eight women clustered around the little boy, each one straining to smile. \"When his daddy's in Dallas,\" read the caption, \"his seven-year-old son has eight nannies.\" Each nanny looked tired. The only person who seemed happy was Percy J. Wellington himself, wearing a wild grin like he was planning to push them all into the pool. \"I watched him running around and around,\" my brother remembered thoughtfully, \"like it was a game, to see who he could torture today.\" My brother said it slowly, like he was trying to understand another mystery -- why Percy was the way that he was. \"They'd actually hired children to be guests at his party. Even the caterers were terrified of him -- a staff of ten people who had laid out every possible kind of dessert on a fancy long table. But no one could eat any of it until Percy gave them permission. When that sad little girl climbed out of the pool, she looked frustrated and angry -- as Percy taunted her and gobbled a big piece of cake. The girl's mother just looked away helplessly.\" \"Her mother didn't say anything?\" \"They were all terrified of displeasing Percy's stepmother, who looked like an evil queen in her fancy white dress. But she'd hired the poorest people she could find -- people who really needed the money.\" \"Who'd hired them?\" \"Mr. Wellington's secretary. She was young and blonde, and she actually looked a little like Jessica Simpson. That's how I remembered her name -- Jessica -- and I just assumed that Mrs. Wellington, the queen of the castle, was insanely jealous of her.\" \"I bet,\" I said, fascinated by all the crazy people in the rich family. \"And it got even crazier when Percy disappeared.\" I was astonished, and my brother looked deeply embarrassed. \"While I stared at the little girl's mother, one of the nannies began arguing with Mrs. Wellington. With eight nannies, there was no one nanny who was in charge of discipline, but this particular nanny was very upset.\" \"Angelita, I paid for these guests,\" Mrs. Wellington had said, genuinely confused. \"A little boy needs discipline,\" the nanny argued. \"Or he'll grow up to be rotten.\" And that's when they heard the screams. \"It was Jessica,\" my brother said, \"screaming and screaming like the star in a horror movie.\" Percy was missing, and no one could find him. Jessica had turned her back for exactly five seconds, she'd said, but Percy was gone -- and then she'd felt helpless, and started to scream. Even after we searched the whole pool area, we couldn't find him.\" \"So where was he?\" I asked. There had been a private forest that surrounded the Wellington mansion, with a little path that ran back towards a guest cottage by their lake. My brother reasoned Percy couldn't have gone towards the mansion without somebody seeing him -- so he investigated the path. He spotted his first clue -- Percy's half-eaten piece of cake. \"The path only went in one direction, so I followed it to their guest cottage. Stacked outside was a pyramid of gifts – beautifully wrapped presents piled high into an impressive tower, with a gold rectangular box on the top. Mrs. Wellington wanted to surprise Percy, so that morning she'd secretly created the 'present pyramid' on the cottage's porch. No one else had known where they were -- but of course, if Percy guessed where his presents were hidden, he'd run off to explore them. \"Sure enough, Percy was there -- his face smeared with cake frosting. He refused to go back to the party. I told him his eight nannies were all worried, and he said 'Good!' I told him Jessica was even screaming, and he laughed and said he hated her. Finally I invented the perfect reason for him to rejoin his hired guests. \"I think someone's stealing your desserts.\" Percy ran down the path back to the pool screaming. A throng of happy nannies had crowded around him... Jessica squealed with joy and spent the next half hour on her phone explaining to Mr. Wellington that his son wasn't missing after all. But not a single one of the other children had smiled. Percy wanted to make sure none of them had eaten his desserts -- so he ran to the table and began gobbling them all down himself. He dug his fingers into the pie, grabbed jello with his other hand, scooped cookies up with his sticky right hand and brownies with his left. \"Stop it!\" screamed Angelita. \"Food is for sharing! Besides, you can't eat all that yourself.\" With a mouth full of blueberry pie, Percy mumbled back, \"I can too!\" And that's when the robbery occurred. \"That was the toughest part of the case,\" my brother said. \"Because when I asked the nannies who hated Percy enough to rob him, they said 'Everybody.'\" \"All eight of them said it -- at the exact same time.\" Percy was wired from all the sugar he'd just eaten, and he'd run around continuously for almost half an hour, my brother remembered. Angelita tried to distract him by saying there were still gifts for him at the guest cottage -- and Percy ran back down the path, crazy from the sugar and now frightened someone might steal his presents. But strangely enough, he was half right. All of the presents were there -- except for the most valuable one. \"His X-Box had been smashed to bits on the ground. Not just any X-Box, this one was gold-plated.\" \"Oh, come on.\" \"His father had taken it out of its original plastic case, then had a jeweler hand-craft it. It's in the article. I looked down, and read the People magazine article. \"Vincent Wellington even commissioned a Greenwich-based artist to create a customized case for young Percy's game console, replacing its ordinary plastic with pure, 14-caret gold.\" I checked the cover to make sure this was a real copy of People magazine... \"We didn't realize it at the time,\" my brother said, \"because Percy was busy ripping through all the wrapping paper on the presents. But Mrs. Wellington called me over and asked what had happened to the X-Box. With all the gold, it was worth thousands of dollars -- and it was supposed to be on top of the pyramid of presents. But it wasn't. \"I'd seen it there the first time I hunted down Percy, so I began looking around. I found it inside the guest cottage, a pile of smashed pieces from the game computer's circuitry. \"And the prime suspect was standing next to it.\" \"Who was it?\" \"The little girl Percy pushed into the pool.\" The cottage had been locked, but there was a window in the back that was left open for ventilation. It was four feet off the ground, but the little girl had done a chin-up on the sill, and then climbed inside to see what all those gold pieces were doing on the floor. \"Emily, are you telling me the truth,\" my brother had asked her gently. And Emily nodded her head emphatically up and down -- which is what he'd expect her to do, whether she was telling the truth or not. \"I was terrified of what Percy might do -- an out-of-control boy, wired up on sugar, staring at the pieces of a shiny gold present. Percy's temper was like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off, so I began looking for clues.\" The window's frame had a bolt so the window couldn't have been opened any higher, and no adult could've crawled inside. There was just one set of footprints leading to the window -- little Emily's -- so my brother ruled out the other children. But three people had keys to the cottage. One was Angelita, the nanny who'd wanted Percy to be disciplined. Had she grabbed the shiniest present and smashed it as a message for his mother? Mrs. Wellington seemed to think so, though she also blamed her husband's secretary, Jessica. \"Because Jessica was blonde, and Mrs. Wellington was jealous?\" \"She probably was. But Percy really hated Jessica and was always playing mean tricks on her. Once, he squirted a bottle of maple syrup into her hair. Jessica was furious -- she screams easily. So she definitely had a motive for revenge.\" My brother sighed patiently, like he wished some good will could've found the family. \"And Percy was a suspect too,\" he said. \"He'd run off to the cottage first, and he could've smashed the X-Box himself -- just to make everyone feel sorry for him. He had his own key, and he was capable of anything. Maybe he was going to blame it on Jessica -- or the little girl.\" My brother searched frantically for clues, but there weren't any. The cottage was seldom used, so it was still perfectly tidy from the last time it had been cleaned. The doorknob was shiny and spotless, and there was no furniture inside -- just a big empty room with a smashed X-Box on the floor. My brother sighed as he told the story now. \"They had all that money, but they were all so crazy.\" \"But at least I figured out who smashed the X-Box.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the exact moment the X-Box was intact  \n   • When the detective first located the missing Percy at the guest-cottage porch the present-pyramid was untouched and the gold-plated X-Box was still on the very top.  \n   ⇒ Any damage must have been done later.\n\n2. Fix the interval during which it could be smashed  \n   • After being found, Percy and the detective returned to the pool area and Percy stayed there—under everyone’s eyes—eating desserts for “almost half an hour.”  \n   • Angelita, seven other nannies, Mrs. Wellington, the caterers, the children and Jessica (who was “on the phone for the next half hour”) were also in the pool enclosure; no-one left.  \n   • When that half-hour ended Angelita tempted Percy to go back to the cottage (“There are still gifts for you”).  \n   • Percy alone ran down the path.  \n   • A few minutes later he returned in a rage, told his step-mother that his most valuable present had been destroyed, and the detective went to investigate.  \n   ⇒ The X-Box was smashed in the very short period in which Percy was the only person at the cottage the second time.\n\n3. Who could physically get the X-Box inside and lock the door?  \n   • The cottage door was locked again when the detective arrived; whoever took the X-Box inside had to use a key.  \n   • Only three keys exist: Percy’s, Jessica’s, Angelita’s.  \n   • Jessica was still talking to Mr. Wellington beside the pool (witnessed by half a dozen nannies).  \n   • Angelita never left the pool enclosure; several nannies confirm she was scolding children the whole time Percy was away.  \n   • Therefore the only key-holder actually present at the cottage was Percy himself.\n\n4. Window evidence  \n   • The back window was bolted so it could open only a few inches—just enough for a small child to squeeze through.  \n   • There was only one set of footprints in the soft ground under the sill and they were Emily’s.  \n   • Emily therefore entered after the X-Box had already been smashed; she merely discovered the wreckage.  She could not have carried a heavy, gift-wrapped, gold-plated console through that narrow gap.\n\n5. Motive  \n   • Percy’s behaviour pattern is pure spite: pushing children into the pool, tormenting nannies, enjoying the panic when he disappeared.  \n   • A spiteful, sugar-charged seven-year-old who thinks someone might “steal” his presents has a perfect reason to grab the shiniest one, lock himself in the cottage, rip it open, and—in a tantrum—smash it when it will not immediately work.  \n   • The gold plating was still with the broken circuitry; nothing was stolen, so the crime was vandalism, not theft—again matching Percy’s personality.\n\n6. Deduction  \n   • Opportunity: Only Percy was at the right place at the right time with a key.  \n   • Physical facts: Door relocked, window too small, no adult footprints.  \n   • Nature of damage: Wanton destruction, not an organised theft.  \n   ⇒ Percy J. Wellington is the culprit; everyone else is cleared by time, access or physical impossibility.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPercy J. Wellington, Angelita (senior nanny), Jessica (Mr. Wellington’s secretary), Emily (little girl), any of the other seven nannies\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nPercy J. Wellington\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. After being scolded for hogging the desserts, Percy was reminded there were still unopened presents at the lakeside guest cottage.  \n2. Key in hand, he sprinted down the path, unlocked the door, dragged the glittering gold-plated X-Box inside and tore at the wrapping.  \n3. Either the heavy console slipped out of his hands or, in a temper because he could not play it instantly, Percy smashed it against the bare floor.  \n4. He relocked the cottage, stuffed the key back into his pocket and hurried to accuse “somebody” of destroying his prize.  \n5. A few minutes later Emily, still furious about the pool incident and curious about the presents, pulled herself through the half-open window, found the wreckage and was discovered there by the detective.  \n6. Because the door was relocked and only Percy had both the key and the opportunity, the detective realised the vandal was the birthday boy himself.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAngelita – She never left the pool area during the brief window when the console was destroyed; several nannies saw her the whole time.  \nJessica – Likewise remained beside the pool, audibly on the phone with Mr. Wellington for the duration; dozens heard the conversation.  \nEmily – Could enter only through the narrow back window (her footprints prove it) and could not have hauled a heavy console through it; she arrived after the damage was done.  \nOther nannies / guests – They had neither keys nor time to reach the cottage without being noticed, and no footprints or other physical traces place them there.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

Angelita tried to distract him by saying there were still gifts for him at the guest cottage -- and Percy ran back down the path, crazy from the sugar and now frightened someone might steal his presents. But strangely enough, he was half right. All of the presents were there -- except for the most valuable one. \"His X-Box had been smashed to bits on the ground. Not just any X-Box, this one was gold-plated.\" \"Oh, come on.\" \"His father had taken it out of its original plastic case, then had a jeweler hand-craft it. It's in the article. I looked down, and read the People magazine article. \"Vincent Wellington even commissioned a Greenwich-based artist to create a customized case for young Percy's game console, replacing its ordinary plastic with pure, 14-caret gold.\" I checked the cover to make sure this was a real copy of People magazine... \"We didn't realize it at the time,\" my brother said, \"because Percy was busy ripping through all the wrapping paper on the presents. But Mrs. Wellington called me over and asked what had happened to the X-Box. With all the gold, it was worth thousands of dollars -- and it was supposed to be on top of the pyramid of presents. But it wasn't. \"I'd seen it there the first time I hunted down Percy, so I began looking around. I found it inside the guest cottage, a pile of smashed pieces from the game computer's circuitry. \"And the prime suspect was standing next to it.\" \"Who was it?\" \"The little girl Percy pushed into the pool.\" The cottage had been locked, but there was a window in the back that was left open for ventilation. It was four feet off the ground, but the little girl had done a chin-up on the sill, and then climbed inside to see what all those gold pieces were doing on the floor. \"Emily, are you telling me the truth,\" my brother had asked her gently. And Emily nodded her head emphatically up and down -- which is what he'd expect her to do, whether she was telling the truth or not. \"I was terrified of what Percy might do -- an out-of-control boy, wired up on sugar, staring at the pieces of a shiny gold present. Percy's temper was like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off, so I began looking for clues.\" The window's frame had a bolt so the window couldn't have been opened any higher, and no adult could've crawled inside. There was just one set of footprints leading to the window -- little Emily's -- so my brother ruled out the other children. But three people had keys to the cottage. One was Angelita, the nanny who'd wanted Percy to be disciplined. Had she grabbed the shiniest present and smashed it as a message for his mother? Mrs. Wellington seemed to think so, though she also blamed her husband's secretary, Jessica. \"Because Jessica was blonde, and Mrs. Wellington was jealous?\" \"She probably was. But Percy really hated Jessica and was always playing mean tricks on her. Once, he squirted a bottle of maple syrup into her hair. Jessica was furious -- she screams easily. So she definitely had a motive for revenge.\" My brother sighed patiently, like he wished some good will could've found the family. \"And Percy was a suspect too,\" he said. \"He'd run off to the cottage first, and he could've smashed the X-Box himself -- just to make everyone feel sorry for him. He had his own key, and he was capable of anything. Maybe he was going to blame it on Jessica -- or the little girl.\" My brother searched frantically for clues, but there weren't any. The cottage was seldom used, so it was still perfectly tidy from the last time it had been cleaned. The doorknob was shiny and spotless, and there was no furniture inside -- just a big empty room with a smashed X-Box on the floor. My brother sighed as he told the story now. \"They had all that money, but they were all so crazy.\" \"But at least I figured out who smashed the X-Box.\"",

      "mystery_text": "My brother swears it's true. \"The Wellingtons are wealthy. That's how I remembered it.\" And when he'd first showed up, their son was pushing a little girl into the pool. \"Was it deliberate?\" \"Oh, absolutely. She was shaking some water out of her ear, and Percy J. Wellington just rushed up behind her and shoved her over the edge.\" \"Why would he do that?\" \"Because he was a brat.\" Mr. Wellington wasn't there. He'd hired my brother, a detective, to provide security for the party that Mrs. Wellington was giving her seven-year-old stepson. But I couldn't believe Percy was as rotten as my brother claimed. \"This was the brattiest kid in the world -- literally,\" he said. \"That's what everyone called him.\" He opened a drawer in his desk and pulled out a copy of People magazine from four years ago. He flicked through its stories about celebrities like Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears until he'd found the story he was looking for, and showed me its headline. \"Percy J. Wellington: The Brattiest Kid in the World.\" Scanning the article, I started to believe. There was a picture of eight women clustered around the little boy, each one straining to smile. \"When his daddy's in Dallas,\" read the caption, \"his seven-year-old son has eight nannies.\" Each nanny looked tired. The only person who seemed happy was Percy J. Wellington himself, wearing a wild grin like he was planning to push them all into the pool. \"I watched him running around and around,\" my brother remembered thoughtfully, \"like it was a game, to see who he could torture today.\" My brother said it slowly, like he was trying to understand another mystery -- why Percy was the way that he was. \"They'd actually hired children to be guests at his party. Even the caterers were terrified of him -- a staff of ten people who had laid out every possible kind of dessert on a fancy long table. But no one could eat any of it until Percy gave them permission. When that sad little girl climbed out of the pool, she looked frustrated and angry -- as Percy taunted her and gobbled a big piece of cake. The girl's mother just looked away helplessly.\" \"Her mother didn't say anything?\" \"They were all terrified of displeasing Percy's stepmother, who looked like an evil queen in her fancy white dress. But she'd hired the poorest people she could find -- people who really needed the money.\" \"Who'd hired them?\" \"Mr. Wellington's secretary. She was young and blonde, and she actually looked a little like Jessica Simpson. That's how I remembered her name -- Jessica -- and I just assumed that Mrs. Wellington, the queen of the castle, was insanely jealous of her.\" \"I bet,\" I said, fascinated by all the crazy people in the rich family. \"And it got even crazier when Percy disappeared.\" I was astonished, and my brother looked deeply embarrassed. \"While I stared at the little girl's mother, one of the nannies began arguing with Mrs. Wellington. With eight nannies, there was no one nanny who was in charge of discipline, but this particular nanny was very upset.\" \"Angelita, I paid for these guests,\" Mrs. Wellington had said, genuinely confused. \"A little boy needs discipline,\" the nanny argued. \"Or he'll grow up to be rotten.\" And that's when they heard the screams. \"It was Jessica,\" my brother said, \"screaming and screaming like the star in a horror movie.\" Percy was missing, and no one could find him. Jessica had turned her back for exactly five seconds, she'd said, but Percy was gone -- and then she'd felt helpless, and started to scream. Even after we searched the whole pool area, we couldn't find him.\" \"So where was he?\" I asked. There had been a private forest that surrounded the Wellington mansion, with a little path that ran back towards a guest cottage by their lake. My brother reasoned Percy couldn't have gone towards the mansion without somebody seeing him -- so he investigated the path. He spotted his first clue -- Percy's half-eaten piece of cake. \"The path only went in one direction, so I followed it to their guest cottage. Stacked outside was a pyramid of gifts – beautifully wrapped presents piled high into an impressive tower, with a gold rectangular box on the top. Mrs. Wellington wanted to surprise Percy, so that morning she'd secretly created the 'present pyramid' on the cottage's porch. No one else had known where they were -- but of course, if Percy guessed where his presents were hidden, he'd run off to explore them. \"Sure enough, Percy was there -- his face smeared with cake frosting. He refused to go back to the party. I told him his eight nannies were all worried, and he said 'Good!' I told him Jessica was even screaming, and he laughed and said he hated her. Finally I invented the perfect reason for him to rejoin his hired guests. \"I think someone's stealing your desserts.\" Percy ran down the path back to the pool screaming. A throng of happy nannies had crowded around him... Jessica squealed with joy and spent the next half hour on her phone explaining to Mr. Wellington that his son wasn't missing after all. But not a single one of the other children had smiled. Percy wanted to make sure none of them had eaten his desserts -- so he ran to the table and began gobbling them all down himself. He dug his fingers into the pie, grabbed jello with his other hand, scooped cookies up with his sticky right hand and brownies with his left. \"Stop it!\" screamed Angelita. \"Food is for sharing! Besides, you can't eat all that yourself.\" With a mouth full of blueberry pie, Percy mumbled back, \"I can too!\" And that's when the robbery occurred. \"That was the toughest part of the case,\" my brother said. \"Because when I asked the nannies who hated Percy enough to rob him, they said 'Everybody.'\" \"All eight of them said it -- at the exact same time.\" Percy was wired from all the sugar he'd just eaten, and he'd run around continuously for almost half an hour, my brother remembered.
