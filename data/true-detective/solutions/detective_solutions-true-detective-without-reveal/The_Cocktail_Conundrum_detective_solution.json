    "full_text": "The exclusive cocktail party, hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Fairbank, had prematurely ended with the untimely demise of one of the guests, not to mention Mrs. Fairbank’s social reputation. The victim, Mrs. Maisy Rhys, tested positive for cyanide poisoning. Her death must have been instantaneous, which left no doubt that she had been poisoned at the party. There was nothing to indicate a suicide. On the contrary, Mrs. Rhys had been excited about an upcoming holiday to Africa where she was planning to begin charitable work. No, Inspector Simmons was sure this was not a suicide. The dead woman had also left a will naming each of the other guests as a beneficiary, a strong motive for murder in the inspector’s opinion. Inspector Simmons stepped lightly across the plush carpet and surveyed the room. There were only three suspects waiting to be interviewed, while his report had stated that he was to expect four. A tall, blonde woman walked briskly over and shook the inspector by the hand. “Good evening, I’m Mrs. Fairbank, I do hope we can resolve this quickly, having police here will look terribly bad.” “We seem to be one person short,” the inspector said as he looked briefly around the fashionable living room. “Oh, my husband is unconscious in his chair,” Mrs. Fairbank replied with an indifferent tone. As he looked over the arm of a recliner, Inspector Simmons noticed a corpulent, middle-aged man sleeping soundly, apparently unaware of the grave events that had taken place in his home. “Could you wake your husband up for me please, madam?” “Must I? He’s such a dreadful nuisance unless he’s asleep,” Mrs Fairbank said. “Regrettably madam, it will be necessary,” the inspector replied. Mrs. Fairbank gave her husband an unceremonious kick. After a series of grunts and some mumbled complaints about a headache, the man managed to focus on the inspector. “Heavy night was it, Mr. Fairbank?” “Cocktail party,” Fairbank grumbled. “It might interest you to know that one of your guests is dead.” “Can’t you get my wife to sort it out?” “I’d like you to answer a couple of questions for me, Mr. Fairbank. How many people were here this evening?” “Me, my wife, our son, Mr. Rhys and Mrs. Rhys. Can I go back to sleep now?” “Sir, there’s been a murder!” The inspector cried in exasperation. “Well I’d best let you get on with it then,” Mr Fairbank said as he promptly dropped back off to sleep. Inspector Simmons was tempted to wake Mr. Fairbank up to charge him with aggravating a detective, but his attention came to rest upon a collection of bottles gathered on the central, glass living table. “Were the contents of these bottles all that was consumed at the party?” Simmons asked. “That’s correct,” Mrs. Fairbank replied, “I prepared food as well, but my husband managed to demolish all of that before the guests even arrived.” “Who opened these bottles in preparation for the guests arriving?” “My husband did. He was supposed to be in charge of dispensing the drinks but he just opened all the bottles, helped himself to a drink from each one and then fell asleep.” “Who poured drinks during the party?” “We all helped ourselves before we sat down, no one here is a heavy drinker and we were only on our first round when the tragedy occurred.” “I see,” said the inspector. Inspector Simmons looked around the living room, there were two cocktail glasses side by side on the central table, one on a small table next to a leather armchair and one balanced on the window sill next to an ornate wicker chair. All of the glasses contained a green liquid residue, except for the one by the leather armchair, which had a small amount of creamy white mixture in the bottom. “Who drank from this glass?” Simmons asked as he pointed to the odd one out. “That was mine,” Mr. Rhys said shakily, “the others drank grasshoppers, but I prefer White Russians.” “Ah, so Mr. and Mrs. Fairbank and the victim were all drinking grasshoppers?” “Yes, that’s right,” Mr. Rhys replied, as he looked around the room. Inspector Simmons looked at the two glasses that stood next to each other on the central table. One glass was nearly empty and the other was very nearly full. “Two people must have sat next to each other on the sofa.” “That was me and Maisy,” Ian Fairbank explained. “Which was your glass?” Inspector Simmons asked. “This one,” Ian said as he pointed to the glass that was very nearly empty. The Inspector looked over to the glass that was placed on the window ledge and noted that it was filled almost to the brim. Tucked behind the glass was a small ashtray. “So Mrs. Fairbank, you sat in the wicker chair?” the inspector asked. Mrs. Fairbank nodded briskly in answer. “Quite an ashtray this one is,” the inspector commented as he walked briskly to the central table and scooped up a large metal receptacle that had been sitting just in front of Maisy’s glass. In the ornate ashtray were six cigarette butts. “Yes, I like unusual ornaments,” Mrs. Fairbank said. “Let me see, six cigarette ends are in here. Five Camels and one Marlboro.” “The Camels were Maisy’s,” Ian said, “she was trying to quit, quite ironic really if you think about it.” “Whose is the Marlboro?” Inspector Simmons asked. “That was me, I like the occasional smoke,” Mrs. Fairbank said. “You should try and give up if you can, it’s very bad for you,” Inspector Simmons said with a smile.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Cause of death  \n   • Maisy died within seconds of taking her first sip, so the cyanide had to be in her own glass, not in any of the bottles.  \n   • Therefore the poisoner had to be someone who could get close to that particular glass after Maisy had poured her drink but before she raised it to her lips.\n\n2. Who could get close?  \n   • Mr Fairbank ‑ asleep in a recliner from the moment the guests arrived.  \n   • Mrs Fairbank ‑ sat across the room on a wicker chair; her own glass and a (small, almost unused) ash-tray were on the window-sill. To reach Maisy’s glass she would have had to cross the room in full view of everyone.  \n   • Mr Rhys ‑ sat in the leather arm-chair, several feet from the sofa; he would also have had to stand up and lean over the table in front of the two people on the sofa.  \n   • Ian Fairbank ‑ sat directly beside Maisy on the sofa; the large metal ash-tray and Maisy’s glass were literally in front of him.\n\n3. The cigarette clue  \n   • Six butts were in the metal ash-tray in front of Maisy’s glass: five Camels (Maisy’s brand) and one Marlboro.  \n   • Mrs Fairbank says the Marlboro is hers – yet her own seat already has a small ash-tray next to it and the inspector sees no sign of Marlboros there.  \n   • Logical conclusion: the Marlboro was not hers. Someone else used one of her cigarettes, sat on the sofa, and stubbed it out in the big ash-tray.  \n   • The only person on that sofa was Ian. By smoking one of his mother’s Marlboros he obtained an excuse to lean forward, flick ash and stub the cigarette out – the perfect moment to tip a pinch of cyanide into Maisy’s glass.  \n   • Mrs Fairbank claims the Marlboro to shield her son; the lie explains why the inspector finds no Marlboro butts in her own ash-tray.\n\n4. Motive  \n   • All four survivors were beneficiaries of Maisy’s will, but Ian, the young son with no obvious income, had the strongest personal incentive.  \n   • He also drains his own glass quickly (almost empty) while Maisy scarcely touches hers, suggesting nervousness and a wish to remove his own drink from the scene.\n\n5. Opportunity + act  \n   • Sequence: Everybody pours a first round; the five sit down; Maisy begins chain-smoking and talking.  \n   • Ian lights the borrowed Marlboro, leans forward to tap ash into the ornate ash-tray, and with the same movement drops powdered cyanide into the still-full green cocktail in front of Maisy.  \n   • After five Camels and some conversation Maisy finally sips – and dies.\n\n6. Corroboration  \n   • Mr Fairbank could not have poisoned a specific glass before he fell asleep, because no one knew which glass Maisy would pick.  \n   • Mrs Fairbank’s position in the room and her still-full drink make secret tampering almost impossible.  \n   • Mr Rhys’s different drink and distance from the target glass leave him with far less opportunity than the man right beside the victim.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCedric Fairbank, Miranda Fairbank, Ian Fairbank, Gareth Rhys\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nIan Fairbank\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nMiranda Fairbank (after-the-fact accessory – she lies about the Marlboro to shield her son)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarlier that evening Mr Fairbank opened all the bottles and promptly drank himself into a stupor.  \nWhen the guests arrived everyone mixed a first drink for themselves. Maisy and Ian sat together on the sofa; the wicker chair and window-ledge belonged to Mrs Fairbank, and Mr Rhys took the arm-chair.\n\nDuring the small-talk Maisy chain-smoked her Camels. Ian asked his mother for one of her Marlboros – ostensibly to join her in a smoke, in reality to create a pretext for leaning over the ash-tray. Sitting beside Maisy, Ian lit the Marlboro, chatted, and when he stubbed it out in the large metal ash-tray directly in front of their glasses, he simultaneously sprinkled powdered cyanide into Maisy’s almost-untouched grasshopper.\n\nIan quickly finished his own drink to steady his nerves and remove evidence, but Maisy, more interested in smoking, let her cocktail stand. Several minutes later she finally took her first sip, collapsed and died almost instantly.\n\nWhen Inspector Simmons arrived, Mrs Fairbank realized that the lone Marlboro in the ash-tray could incriminate her son and claimed it as her own. Apart from that attempted cover-up she had no part in the murder itself.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nCedric Fairbank – Already unconscious before the guests began drinking; could not get near Maisy’s glass once it had been poured. If he had poisoned a bottle he would have poisoned himself as well when he sampled from each.\n\nMiranda Fairbank – Sat across the room with her own ash-tray; moving over to tamper with Maisy’s glass would have been obvious. Her glass is still full, showing she never exchanged drinks with the victim. Her only proven falsehood is claiming the Marlboro butt to protect her son after the fact.\n\nGareth Rhys – Sat in the arm-chair, separated from the sofa and the ornate ash-tray by the central table. He drank a different cocktail, giving no reason to approach the grasshopper glasses. No physical evidence links him to the poisoned glass.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Mrs. Fairbank gasped.\n“Mr. Rhys was drinking a different cocktail than his wife, so that rules him out, because his wife would have noticed the change. That leaves me with you, Mrs Fairbank, and your son, Ian.”\n“My son would never do such a thing!” Mrs. Fairbank shot back.\n“Ian sat next to Maisy on the sofa, and would have had the opportunity to switch drinks with her. However, note that the levels in the two glasses are very different. Mrs. Rhys would have noticed if her almost empty glass was suddenly full. Of course you, Mrs. Fairbank, were also drinking a grasshopper and the level of your glass is almost exactly the same as that of this drink here in Maisy’s place.”\n“But I wasn’t sitting anywhere near Maisy! How could I have swapped drinks with her from across the room?” Mrs. Fairbank cried.\n“Oh, but you made sure you came close enough to do it,” Inspector Simmons said quietly, “you got up to put your cigarette out in the ashtray near Maisy when you could much more easily have put it out in the one that was right next to your chair. You see Mrs. Fairbank, I’ve always maintained that smoking is a very dangerous habit.”",

Mrs. Fairbank gasped.\n“Mr. Rhys was drinking a different cocktail than his wife, so that rules him out, because his wife would have noticed the change. That leaves me with you, Mrs Fairbank, and your son, Ian.”\n“My son would never do such a thing!” Mrs. Fairbank shot back.\n“Ian sat next to Maisy on the sofa, and would have had the opportunity to switch drinks with her. However, note that the levels in the two glasses are very different. Mrs. Rhys would have noticed if her almost empty glass was suddenly full. Of course you, Mrs. Fairbank, were also drinking a grasshopper and the level of your glass is almost exactly the same as that of this drink here in Maisy’s place.”\n“But I wasn’t sitting anywhere near Maisy! How could I have swapped drinks with her from across the room?” Mrs. Fairbank cried.\n“Oh, but you made sure you came close enough to do it,” Inspector Simmons said quietly, “you got up to put your cigarette out in the ashtray near Maisy when you could much more easily have put it out in the one that was right next to your chair. You see Mrs. Fairbank, I’ve always maintained that smoking is a very dangerous habit.”"
