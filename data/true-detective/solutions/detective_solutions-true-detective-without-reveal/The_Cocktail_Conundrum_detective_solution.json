    "full_text": "The exclusive cocktail party, hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Fairbank, had prematurely ended with the untimely demise of one of the guests, not to mention Mrs. Fairbank’s social reputation. The victim, Mrs. Maisy Rhys, tested positive for cyanide poisoning. Her death must have been instantaneous, which left no doubt that she had been poisoned at the party. There was nothing to indicate a suicide. On the contrary, Mrs. Rhys had been excited about an upcoming holiday to Africa where she was planning to begin charitable work. No, Inspector Simmons was sure this was not a suicide. The dead woman had also left a will naming each of the other guests as a beneficiary, a strong motive for murder in the inspector’s opinion. Inspector Simmons stepped lightly across the plush carpet and surveyed the room. There were only three suspects waiting to be interviewed, while his report had stated that he was to expect four. A tall, blonde woman walked briskly over and shook the inspector by the hand. “Good evening, I’m Mrs. Fairbank, I do hope we can resolve this quickly, having police here will look terribly bad.” “We seem to be one person short,” the inspector said as he looked briefly around the fashionable living room. “Oh, my husband is unconscious in his chair,” Mrs. Fairbank replied with an indifferent tone. As he looked over the arm of a recliner, Inspector Simmons noticed a corpulent, middle-aged man sleeping soundly, apparently unaware of the grave events that had taken place in his home. “Could you wake your husband up for me please, madam?” “Must I? He’s such a dreadful nuisance unless he’s asleep,” Mrs Fairbank said. “Regrettably madam, it will be necessary,” the inspector replied. Mrs. Fairbank gave her husband an unceremonious kick. After a series of grunts and some mumbled complaints about a headache, the man managed to focus on the inspector. “Heavy night was it, Mr. Fairbank?” “Cocktail party,” Fairbank grumbled. “It might interest you to know that one of your guests is dead.” “Can’t you get my wife to sort it out?” “I’d like you to answer a couple of questions for me, Mr. Fairbank. How many people were here this evening?” “Me, my wife, our son, Mr. Rhys and Mrs. Rhys. Can I go back to sleep now?” “Sir, there’s been a murder!” The inspector cried in exasperation. “Well I’d best let you get on with it then,” Mr Fairbank said as he promptly dropped back off to sleep. Inspector Simmons was tempted to wake Mr. Fairbank up to charge him with aggravating a detective, but his attention came to rest upon a collection of bottles gathered on the central, glass living table. “Were the contents of these bottles all that was consumed at the party?” Simmons asked. “That’s correct,” Mrs. Fairbank replied, “I prepared food as well, but my husband managed to demolish all of that before the guests even arrived.” “Who opened these bottles in preparation for the guests arriving?” “My husband did. He was supposed to be in charge of dispensing the drinks but he just opened all the bottles, helped himself to a drink from each one and then fell asleep.” “Who poured drinks during the party?” “We all helped ourselves before we sat down, no one here is a heavy drinker and we were only on our first round when the tragedy occurred.” “I see,” said the inspector. Inspector Simmons looked around the living room, there were two cocktail glasses side by side on the central table, one on a small table next to a leather armchair and one balanced on the window sill next to an ornate wicker chair. All of the glasses contained a green liquid residue, except for the one by the leather armchair, which had a small amount of creamy white mixture in the bottom. “Who drank from this glass?” Simmons asked as he pointed to the odd one out. “That was mine,” Mr. Rhys said shakily, “the others drank grasshoppers, but I prefer White Russians.” “Ah, so Mr. and Mrs. Fairbank and the victim were all drinking grasshoppers?” “Yes, that’s right,” Mr. Rhys replied, as he looked around the room. Inspector Simmons looked at the two glasses that stood next to each other on the central table. One glass was nearly empty and the other was very nearly full. “Two people must have sat next to each other on the sofa.” “That was me and Maisy,” Ian Fairbank explained. “Which was your glass?” Inspector Simmons asked. “This one,” Ian said as he pointed to the glass that was very nearly empty. The Inspector looked over to the glass that was placed on the window ledge and noted that it was filled almost to the brim. Tucked behind the glass was a small ashtray. “So Mrs. Fairbank, you sat in the wicker chair?” the inspector asked. Mrs. Fairbank nodded briskly in answer. “Quite an ashtray this one is,” the inspector commented as he walked briskly to the central table and scooped up a large metal receptacle that had been sitting just in front of Maisy’s glass. In the ornate ashtray were six cigarette butts. “Yes, I like unusual ornaments,” Mrs. Fairbank said. “Let me see, six cigarette ends are in here. Five Camels and one Marlboro.” “The Camels were Maisy’s,” Ian said, “she was trying to quit, quite ironic really if you think about it.” “Whose is the Marlboro?” Inspector Simmons asked. “That was me, I like the occasional smoke,” Mrs. Fairbank said. “You should try and give up if you can, it’s very bad for you,” Inspector Simmons said with a smile.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Cause-of-death filter  \n   •  Cyanide acts almost at once.  \n   •  Only Mrs Rhys collapsed; everybody else is perfectly well.  \n   •  Therefore the poison cannot have been placed in any bottle or mixer that more than one person used.\n\n2. Drink check  \n   •  Mr Rhys had a White Russian (creamy residue).  \n   •  Mr Fairbank, Mrs Fairbank and Ian were all drinking Grasshoppers (green residue).  \n   •  Mrs Rhys also had a Grasshopper, yet no one else who drank that cocktail was harmed.  \n   •  So the Grasshopper itself cannot be the source of the cyanide – unless only her own glass was tampered with.\n\n3. Glass examination  \n   •  Ian’s Grasshopper glass is almost empty.  \n   •  Mrs Rhys’s Grasshopper glass is still almost full, implying she took only one or two sips – too little volume to contain a lethal dose of cyanide in solution.  \n   •  Something she consumed more directly and in greater concentration than the drink is required.\n\n4. The cigarettes  \n   •  Six stubs in the large ornate ashtray standing immediately in front of Mrs Rhys’s glass:  \n        – 5 Camel butts (Mrs Rhys’s usual brand)  \n        – 1 Marlboro butt  \n   •  According to everyone present the only Marlboro smoker is Mrs Fairbank, and she had her own small ashtray on the windowsill beside her chair.  \n   •  Why would one of her Marlboros appear in Mrs Rhys’s ashtray unless she had been at that spot and deliberately left it there?  \n   •  Cyanide can be administered very efficiently in a treated cigarette; when the treated cigarette burns it releases hydrogen cyanide gas that is inhaled directly into the lungs, producing the sort of instantaneous death the pathologist has reported.\n\n5. Opportunity & mechanics  \n   •  Mrs Fairbank is the only person who smokes Marlboros.  \n   •  She could easily prepare a single poisoned Marlboro in advance.  \n   •  When the party began she walked over to the sofa, offered Mrs Rhys “one of mine – you really should try them, they taste milder”, then, after it was lit, “absent-mindedly” stubbed her own cigarette in the same ashtray, leaving the incriminating Marlboro butt among Mrs Rhys’s Camels.  \n   •  Seconds later Mrs Rhys inhaled a lethal dose of hydrogen cyanide, slumped back on the sofa, and died.  \n   •  Because the cyanide was delivered by smoke, nobody else was in danger and no trace of poison was necessary in any bottle, glass or food.\n\n6. Motive  \n   •  Mrs Rhys’s will left money or property to every other guest.  \n   •  Mrs Fairbank, whose overriding concern seems to be her social standing and the expense of her functions, had both motive (financial gain) and the cool self-interest shown throughout the interview.\n\n7. Excluding the others  \n   •  Mr Fairbank was asleep long before the fatal cigarette was smoked.  \n   •  Ian does not smoke at all; he could not have introduced a Marlboro butt into the ashtray.  \n   •  Mr Rhys also does not smoke and was sitting apart in a leather arm-chair with his own drink.  \n   •  Only Mrs Fairbank had the poisoned-cigarette method, the presence at the sofa, the unusual Marlboro butt in the wrong ashtray, and a strong motive.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMrs. Clarissa Fairbank, Mr. Harvey Fairbank, Ian Fairbank, Mr. Rhys\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMrs. Clarissa Fairbank\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nClarissa Fairbank decided in advance to profit from Maisy Rhys’s will.  \nDuring the afternoon she injected or soaked the end of one Marlboro cigarette with a concentrated solution of cyanide and let it dry.  \nAt the cocktail party she kept the doctored Marlboro separate from the rest of the pack.  \nWhen the drinks had been poured and the guests were finding seats, she walked over to the sofa where Maisy and Ian were settling. Pretending sociability, Clarissa produced the prepared cigarette, offered it to Maisy, and lit it for her. Clarissa then smoked an ordinary Marlboro of her own and, still standing by the sofa, stubbed it out in the ornate ashtray so that a normal Marlboro butt would camouflage the poisoned one once the fatal cigarette was also stubbed there.  \nMaisy took two or three draws on the cigarette, inhaled hydrogen cyanide, and died almost instantly, dropping her still-lit Marlboro into the same ashtray. In the confusion that followed, Clarissa calmly returned to the wicker chair by the window, placing her untouched Grasshopper and her small personal ashtray beside her, outwardly unconnected with the tragedy she had engineered.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mr. Harvey Fairbank – Drunk and asleep long before the fatal cigarette was smoked; no opportunity to offer or tamper with anything at that moment.  \n• Ian Fairbank – Does not smoke; could not have supplied a Marlboro cigarette or left a Marlboro butt in the ornate ashtray. His own drink proves harmless, and he was seated throughout.  \n• Mr. Rhys – Also a non-smoker and was sitting in a separate armchair. He had no reason to approach the sofa or the ashtray where the poisoned cigarette was found, and no Marlboros in his possession. The single distinguishing clue (the out-of-place Marlboro butt) excludes him.  \nTherefore, only Mrs. Clarissa Fairbank had the unique means, the opportunity, and the motive, and the physical evidence in the ashtray points directly to her.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

However, note that the levels in the two glasses are very different. Mrs. Rhys would have noticed if her almost empty glass was suddenly full. Of course you, Mrs. Fairbank, were also drinking a grasshopper and the level of your glass is almost exactly the same as that of this drink here in Maisy’s place.”\n“But I wasn’t sitting anywhere near Maisy! How could I have swapped drinks with her from across the room?” Mrs. Fairbank cried.\n“Oh, but you made sure you came close enough to do it,” Inspector Simmons said quietly, “you got up to put your cigarette out in the ashtray near Maisy when you could much more easily have put it out in the one that was right next to your chair.

However, note that the levels in the two glasses are very different. Mrs. Rhys would have noticed if her almost empty glass was suddenly full. Of course you, Mrs. Fairbank, were also drinking a grasshopper and the level of your glass is almost exactly the same as that of this drink here in Maisy’s place.”\n“But I wasn’t sitting anywhere near Maisy! How could I have swapped drinks with her from across the room?” Mrs. Fairbank cried.\n“Oh, but you made sure you came close enough to do it,” Inspector Simmons said quietly, “you got up to put your cigarette out in the ashtray near Maisy when you could much more easily have put it out in the one that was right next to your chair. You see Mrs. Fairbank, I’ve always maintained that smoking is a very dangerous habit.”"
