    "full_text": "The detective surveyed the scene enthusiastically, taking in all of the surrounding area. He examined each square foot of land as if it was a puzzle, trying to piece together a picture in his mind. Frank Albertson stood nearby, his son Bill at his side. Bill was holding a shotgun he had earlier been sent inside to find, upon discovering their scarecrow. You see, Frank Albertson awoke early in the morning, got into his overalls, and went out into his fields. But when he arrived, he found his scarecrow and much of the surrounding produce in ruin. At first he thought the crows had been wise to his scheme, and that they had torn the scarecrow apart. But when he found the scarecrow's head, and its straw for brains scattered nearly twenty yards away from where its body lay ravaged, he concluded that the offender was a bigger, stronger creature. “I don't think it was an animal,” muttered Detective Johnson, now examining the scarecrow's torso. “These slashes are too clean to be from an animal. This was done with a knife -- one with a wide blade. The cuts run deep, and yet it doesn’t look like any fabric was torn. So it was done with more of a stabbing motion, I'd say.” “Someone stabbed my scarecrow?” Frank grimaced, raising an eyebrow. “And look at this,” the detective continued. He reached into the straw-lined body of the scarecrow, and pulled out a sunflower seed. “Do you grow any sunflowers on your farm, Mr. Albertson?” “’Fraid not” he answered briskly. “Can you tell me the names of any nearby people? Perhaps any rival farmers?” “Well,” he answered, “there is Professor Surenie. He’s a schoolteacher. He doesn't farm himself, but his boy has been looking into the business. He might have done something.” “Anyone else?” the detective asked. “Bill, could you give us a few minutes?” he asked, turning to his son. Bill glared at his father and walked away. “As to your question, detective. Yes, there are other people I have in mind. There’s Rachel Beaton, the wife of a wheat farmer. Or Mr. Fletcher, a grocery store owner who was recently hurt financially by some rotten vegetables I sent in. … And, there’s my son.” “You suspect Bill?” “Bill and I had a bit of a tiff last night,” the farmer explained, removing his cap momentarily and scratching his nearly hairless scalp. “Wouldn't surprise me if he took it out on me.” “What was the fight about?” “He was upset about losing something he’d just bought. I may have been a bit hard on him … telling him that he’s irresponsible and that he loses everything. … It started there at least.” As Frank spoke, the detective came upon a footprint. He took a picture, and then slid the sleek digital camera back into his pocket. The detective called the town's police station, and managed to convince the police chief to dispatch a car to round up the three other suspects. An hour later, they were there, lined up, awaiting the detective's word. “One of you,” he said, “is responsible for this mess. And I want to know who.” The grocery store owner, Mr. Fletcher, replied in a hostile manner, “I've been at my store all day, and was doing inventory all night. Couldn't have been me,” he said, spitting a seed on the ground. The detective nodded, then looked at Professor Surenie, the next in line. “I was out of town until morning -- at a teacher's conference in Denver.” Once more, the detective nodded. Next, he looked at Rachel. “I was … err … indisposed last night.” Bill interrupted: “She was passed out at the bar -- I passed there when I was in town, picking up a new hunting knife.” This triggered the detective's interest. “And where is that knife now, boy?” he asked. “I don't know,” he answered. “I must have lost it when I was in town.” “How convenient,” the detective noted. He stepped towards the footprint he found earlier, lining it up with his own boot. It was the same size as his shoe -- size 11. He got his camera, and took another snapshot of the print, but this time with his foot on it. After this, the detective turned to Frank Albertson. “Sir, when did you say you sent in that shipment of rotten vegetables to Mr. Fletcher?” “About two months ago,” he answered. “Why do you ask?” The detective ignored him, and went on to ask Bill a question. “Bill, you say you lost your recently purchased hunting knife. Is this correct?” Bill nodded. “Where, might I ask, did you go while in town after purchasing it?” “Once I got it, I went to the grocery store, and then after picking up some food for my dad, I came right home.” “Uh-huh, I see,” said the detective. Suddenly, he clapped his hands together, and addressed the suspects. “All of you may go home tonight. I will call for you to return to this farm tomorrow afternoon. Then I will give you my findings.” The next day, they all dutifully returned, looking a bit nervous. When they were settled down in the Albertson living room, the suspects looked at one another curiously. “If you would all be so kind, I ask that you would each take off one of your shoes,” said the detective. The four suspects complied. After they had each taken off a shoe, he compared each one to his own boot. All of the men’s shoes were about the same size, while Rachel’s was a good deal smaller. “Now, just to remind you all … unlike a scarecrow, I have a brain and the capacity to think. And I think I know who our offender is.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What had really been done?\n   – The scare-crow had been stabbed several times with a fairly broad hunting-type blade; the surrounding vegetables were chopped up.  \n   – A single sunflower seed was discovered deep inside the straw torso.  \n   – Only one shoe-print was found.  It was the same length as the detective’s own size-11 boot.\n\n2. Who would want to do that?\n   • Mr Fletcher was angry because a consignment of Frank’s vegetables had ruined his profit – a motive that is already two months old.  \n   • Bill had quarrelled violently with his father only a few hours earlier.  He was called “irresponsible” and was obviously still sulking (he glared at his father when asked to leave).  \n   • Rachel and Professor Surenie had no obvious motive.\n\n3. Who could do it?\n   • The damage was done during the night.  Bill was on the farm at night, Fletcher was supposedly “doing inventory” (unverified), Rachel was drunk, the professor was away.  \n   • Bill owned the very thing that made the wounds – the new hunting knife – and claims he “lost it”.  No one else is known to possess a suitable blade.\n\n4. The sunflower-seed clue.\n   • Fletcher habitually spits sunflower seeds; therefore an enemy who wished to throw suspicion on him would plant a seed.  \n   • But a habitual chewer would scatter many shells around the ground, not place a single, whole seed inside the stuffed belly of a scare-crow.  The seed was placed deliberately, not accidentally spat.  \n   • Bill was the only other person known to have visited Fletcher’s grocery that night – he could easily pocket a seed there.\n\n5. The footprint.\n   • Size-11 prints eliminate Rachel.  \n   • All three men wear roughly the same length boot, so the print does not single one out, but it keeps Bill in the running and does nothing to help Fletcher or the professor.\n\n6. Time line.\n   • Bill leaves town with his new knife, stops at Fletcher’s shop (acquires the food – and a sunflower seed), goes home angry, and before dawn slices up the vegetables and the scare-crow, planting the seed to mislead the police.  \n   • He then “loses” the knife and, in the morning, obediently fetches a shotgun for his unsuspecting father.\n\n7. Why the detective asked about the two-month-old vegetable shipment.\n   – He was testing the freshness of Fletcher’s motive.  A petty financial loss two months earlier is weak compared to Bill’s very fresh anger.\n\n8. Why the detective ignored Fletcher’s alibi.\n   – Because the seed in the scare-crow looked like an intentional plant, not an unconscious habit.  The real clue was Bill’s unverified “lost” knife.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBill Albertson, Mr. Fletcher, Professor Surenie, Rachel Beaton\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nBill Albertson\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOn the previous evening Bill Albertson went to town.  Still fuming over the argument with his father, he bought a broad-bladed hunting knife.  He stopped at Mr Fletcher’s grocery to pick up food.  While paying, he noticed Fletcher chewing sunflower seeds and pocketed one of them.\n\nBack at the farm, in the dark, Bill’s anger boiled over.  He walked to the field, slashed and stabbed the vegetables and the scare-crow with his new knife and angrily tore the straw head off, flinging it twenty yards away.  Before leaving he pushed the sunflower seed deep into the scare-crow’s torso, hoping the police would think the seed-spitting grocer had done it.\n\nHe wiped the knife and “lost” it in the field so it could not be traced to him.  At dawn his father discovered the wreckage and called Detective Johnson.  Bill played the innocent son, even volunteering to fetch a shotgun.\n\nJohnson later found the single footprint, the single seed and the nature of the knife-wounds.  The footprint showed the culprit was a man of about his own shoe size; the weapon could only be Bill’s missing knife; and the seed, placed rather than spat, revealed an attempt at framing Fletcher.  All clues converged on Bill. \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mr Fletcher:  although he chews sunflower seeds, a single intact seed hidden inside a scare-crow’s body is inconsistent with his unconscious spitting habit.  His only motive (the spoilt vegetables) is two months old and weak.  \n• Professor Surenie:  verified by conference attendees in Denver; no motive, shoe size merely coincidental.  \n• Rachel Beaton:  verifiable bar patrons confirm she was unconscious; her small shoe size does not match the print; she had neither motive nor weapon.  \nTherefore they are innocent, and the guilty party is Bill Albertson. \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He cost me profits!”\n“It was an accident!” Frank explained. “I sent a truck to deliver them, but it got stuck some miles up the road from the store. It went rancid before he could get them to him.”\n“Liar! You wanted to ruin my business!” Mr. Fletcher yelled.\n“Mr. Fletcher, regardless, I am afraid I am going to have to take you in.” The detective handcuffed Mr. Fletcher, took him to his car, and drove him down to the police station. “Mr. Fletcher,” the detective said looking back, “try not to drop your sunflower seeds next time.”\nThe grocery store owner sighed, spitting out another sunflower seed toward the scattered scarecrow."
