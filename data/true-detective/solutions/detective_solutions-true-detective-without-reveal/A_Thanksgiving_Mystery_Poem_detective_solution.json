    "full_text": "For Thanksgiving, try this game.\nFind the guilty turkey's name in a mystery story rhyme\ntelling of the strangest crime. Though in winter, skies are grey, \nsunshine brightly shone today, shimmering on a thousand lakes\nwhen America awakes. Autumn winds in mornings cold\npaint the leaves of trees bright gold! One lone farmer in his field\nstudied all the food revealed. With no children, all alone,\nhe lived where the food was grown. In the back, a wondrous spread\nwhere Thanksgiving turkey’s bred. His calendar showed the dates\nAmerica celebrates. And this morning it would say\nhe'd awoken to Thanksgiving day! Through the country, he now knew, \nthey'd enjoy the food he grew. Favorite dishes people loved \nonto dinner plates were shoved. Family dinner tables shone\nwith the tasty plants he'd grown. Parents, children, all await it.\nAll but one group: Turkeys hate it. In America, each year\nturkeys dread this day with fear, fearing folks on every street\nhungering for turkey meat. When the daylight brightly broke,\nall the farmer's birds awoke. Since it is a holiday,\nall turkeys can talk today in a wide and special space, \nglowing bright with autumn’s grace. In the farmer's gloomy pen,\nRusty checked the day again. Sure today he'd meet his fate:\nsomeone else's dinner plate. Gobbling to all who'd listen,\n\"With salt brine I soon will glisten.\" Rusty's worried eyes would droop,\nsadly in a shadowed coop. Rusty's brother, Tiny, giggled,\nand his loose red wattle wiggled on his beak, as he did say,\n\"Strange to fear a holiday. You greet it with such suspicion.\nI think that's just superstition. Any day could be your last.\nLearn to live your life out fast! Any day — and, please remember, \nno more likely in November.\" But Rusty was not placated,\nfilled with dread and gloom he waited. His sad beak would not be brightened,\nit's sharp point looked dull and frightened. \"In our turkey pen we lie;\non the fourth Thursday, we die.\" Though his brother just adored him,\nother turkeys just ignored him. There were two more playing games,\nTom and Libby were their names. Strutting 'round the turkey pen,\nTom tried to impress the hen, fanning his best turkey feather,\nhoping they'd soon be together. Tom arrived three days before\nand bragged of a far-off shore where the farmers knew their worth,\nletting turkeys roam the earth. \"Happy turkeys live there still,\non the shores of Turkeyville.\" Though the turkeys liked his joke,\none shy Turkey never spoke. Libby was her name — quite cute\nbut they worried she was mute. Libby seemed to like their den, \nshe never left the turkey pen. Even when the bright sun shone,\nLibby wouldn't leave alone. Rusty searched in vain for hope.\n\"Maybe it's still Wednesday. Nope.\" Tiny laughed and teased poor Rusty.\n\"Don't you think our farmer's trusty? I think you should just relax.\nJust forget the farmer's axe.\" Tom gave his strong wings a flap.\nLibby yawned, and took a nap. All their gobbling gabbing sounds\nfilled the farmer's fertile grounds. Soon the farmer had returned\nfor a dinner that he'd earned. Standing in the wintry sun,\nhis hard work was finally done. He'd prepare a pumpkin pie,\nmashed potatoes, piled high. His best plate would be deserving\nfor the meal he'd be serving. Now was time to pick the winner — \nwhich turkey to choose for dinner? He strolled proud into his yard,\nstudying his pen quite hard. Soon the farmer leaned in to stare\nat the turkeys waiting there. Rusty shook with fear and dread.\t\t\nTiny laughed and bobbed his head. Libby's sleepy eyes were shutting.\nTom ignored them all, still strutting. In November, nature lies\nunder dreary winter skies. Autumn touched the meadows too,\nwhere the yellow wheat stalks grew. Soon the farmer looked around\nbut no sharp axe could be found. Then he looked around again,\nTen feet from the turkey pen. What he saw would make him smile:\nsawdust in a messy pile. where his axe had laid\nnow was just a lonely blade but no handle that could bring it\nto the farmer's arms to swing it. It was gone, the farmer knew,\nthanks to one smart turkey who wishing that the axe was banished,\npecked its handle till it vanished! It would take at least a week\nto destroy it with a beak. Now the farmer, laughing, said\nto the turkeys by his shed: \"Was my turkey-keeping lax?\nWhich of you destroyed my axe?\" For Thanksgiving, try this game.\nFind the guilty turkey's name!",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  All turkeys would prefer that no axe be available, but Rusty alone openly dreads Thanksgiving, repeats “on the fourth Thursday, we die,” and talks of being on someone’s plate.  \n   •  Tiny thinks the danger is “just superstition” and laughs at Rusty – he has no sense of urgency.  \n   •  Tom boasts that in “Turkeyville” no-one eats turkeys; he sees himself as too important to be killed and is busy impressing Libby.  \n   •  Libby seems passive, sleepy, and shows no concern at all.\n\n2.  Opportunity and time requirement  \n   •  The handle was steadily reduced to sawdust.  The rhyme even says: “It would take at least a week / to destroy it with a beak.”  \n   •  Therefore the guilty turkey had to be in the yard for a week or more.  \n        –  Tom “arrived three days before” – three days is not enough.  \n        –  Tiny and Rusty have lived there long-term; so could Libby.  \n   •  Physical access: the axe lay ten feet from the pen.  A turkey that “never left the turkey pen” (Libby) would not reach it.  The culprit must have been willing to slip outside when the farmer was absent.  Rusty is the only bird shown actually looking out of the pen each dawn, checking the calendar and fretting; he was clearly watching the yard.\n\n3.  Behavioural clues  \n   •  Rusty is the sole turkey portrayed as actively searching for a way to survive; fear is a strong motivator to work patiently night after night.  \n   •  Tiny’s ridicule, Tom’s vanity, and Libby’s lethargy make it unlikely any of them would spend hours gnawing wood.  \n   •  The poem’s narrator twice draws special attention to Rusty just before and after the axe discovery – a literary spotlight.\n\n4.  Logical deduction  \n   •  Only a turkey with (i) a strong motive, (ii) at least a week of free time, and (iii) willingness/ability to leave the pen, could finish the job.  \n   •  That description fits Rusty alone.  Therefore Rusty is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRusty, Tiny, Tom, Libby\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nRusty\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nA week or more before Thanksgiving, Rusty began to act on his dread.  \nEach night, when the farmer went inside, Rusty squeezed through a gap in the pen or hopped the low fence, waddled the ten feet to the chopping block, and pecked industriously at the axe-handle.  He worked until his beak ached, then crept back before dawn so no one (not even the other turkeys) noticed.  By Thanksgiving morning the wooden handle had been reduced to splinters and sawdust, leaving only the metal blade.  When the farmer came to choose his bird he found the useless blade and realised someone—some turkey—had sabotaged it.  Rusty, badly frightened but now secretly triumphant, had saved his own neck (and, for the moment, everybody else’s) by destroying the axe.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nTiny had time and access, but no motive; he mocked Rusty’s fear and called it “superstition,” so he would not spend a week of effort on a danger he did not believe in.  \nTom arrived only “three days before,” far less than the week the poem says was needed to chew through the handle.  He could not have finished the job in time.  \nLibby “never left the turkey pen”… and the axe was ten feet outside it.  Unless the poem is lying about her never leaving, she lacked physical opportunity.  Furthermore, her sleepy, indifferent disposition provides no evident motive.  \nThus only Rusty matches all the required conditions, proving the other turkeys innocent.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
