    "full_text": "\"Ghosts,\" said Dillon, sadly. \"A thief!\" I replied. \"Why would you think it was ghosts who stole your saxophone?\" \"It started 30 years ago,\" Dillon sighed. \"There were four of us, then, playing an alto sax and a baritone, plus a low 'contrabass' and a high 'soprano'.\" His eyes were lost in memory, and he smiled happily. \"Our band had a sound like no other. We were this city's biggest saxophone quartet!\" Dillon walked to a tall bookcase, which was stuffed with vinyl records, and ran a tired finger along their edges. He settled on worn-out cover, and soon the needle on his phonograph had found the record's groove. His tiny room filled with 30-year-old music, fast saxophones rollicking while a bass and a drum kept the beat. \"I didn't know it then,\" Dillon explained, \"but my saxophone also had its own legend.\" The quartet's producer had been a notorious music promoter named Shorty Jenkins. \"Rumor had it Shorty created the careers of some famous musicians -- but then later, destroyed them!\" After twenty years of working the music business, Shorty had the right connections to help acts succeed. But was he also a powerful enemy? \"We did whatever Shorty said,\" Dillon laughed. \"And we did it happily. He picked our songs, wrote our arrangements, and he even lined up the other saxophonists. Within four weeks, somehow Shorty had gotten our record into the stores.\" But then reading a newspaper, Dillon had spotted a disturbing article. \"Shorty was bragging that he'd used the instruments of dead musicians for his new saxophone quartet. Without telling us, he'd given us each the saxophone of a famous jazz artist he'd worked with decades before. Dark whispers spread throughout the clubs. Were we exploiting the artists who came before - or preserving what made them special?\" Dillon stared thoughtfully for a moment. \"That Christmas, our alto saxophonist got real sick. And within two weeks, the baritone saxophonist disappeared. We couldn't continue with just two of us, but Shorty promised he'd find the group a replacement. We found out later he was stuck in a big legal fight with a trumpeter he'd discovered years before. Eventually our third saxophonist found another gig instead. And I never heard from any of them again.\" The vinyl record reached the end of its last song, circling through the static in its final groove until Dillon lifted the needed. \"But now, even my saxophone's gone.\" I'd known about Dillon for years -- he was a local legend in our neighborhood, though his glory days had passed. I'd only met him recently, so I was honored that he requested my help. But I had to know one thing first. \"Do you really think ghosts stole your saxophone?\" \"I've played it every afternoon for the last 30 years, riffing and improvising, while imagining that our band might somehow get back together. And every day, for 30 years, I've left it on that saxophone stand.\" He pointed to empty clasps which had always held his instrument. \"Today an hour after I finished, it was gone.\" Could someone have broken into his apartment? \"The window was closed,\" Dillon insisted, \"and my only door was locked! I live on the second floor, high above the street.\" Did anyone have a key? \"Well, obviously the manager of this apartment building has a key, but we never see him around. But you know who else has a key? The boy at the grocery store on the corner,\" Dillon said casually. \"Every Friday he brings around my groceries, so I don't have to visit his store.\" I got his name, but also took a look at Dillon's window. It was covered with dirt, but the window lifted easily, and opened onto a fire escape. But the fire escape stopped on the second floor, its ladder to the street broken off many years before. It seemed impossible, but I asked Dillon one more question. Had he spoken to anyone before the saxophone disappeared? \"That morning I gave an interview,\" Dillon said proudly. \"A college student was recording the history of music in this neighborhood, and he'd wanted to get my story.\" Dillon gave me his number, and I began my investigation. The grocery store was easy to find, with its stands of fruit on the sidewalk and a busy father/son team who were putting customer orders in bags. It was the son who was Dillon's delivery boy -- a skinny teenager named Lenny. He was struggling to put six tomatoes into a sack. I asked Lenny if he delivered groceries to Dillon. \"Yeah, but mostly because I feel sorry for him,\" he said, weighing the sack of tomatoes on a scale. \"After thirty years, that man has nothing.\" I pointed out Dillon had a valuable antique saxophone. \"A saxophone's nothing in this neighborhood,\" Lenny laughed. \"We haven't had a club with live music here for years.\" As he stacked bundles of carrots into a tall pile, Lenny asked his father if just this once he could take a break, but his father sternly shouted back the family motto -- \"Work all day with no breaks ever!\" It seemed sad that the music scene was dying, so I was even more determined to find the legendary saxophone. I placed a phone call to a college student named Eric, who'd phoned Dillon that morning. \"It's certainly a valuable saxophone,\" his eager voice insisted, \"more valuable than most people know!\" I asked him what he meant. \"Those four saxophones really did come from famous jazz men,\" he said with excitement. \"The group's producer, Shorty Jenkins had worked with the greatest musicians of the century. There are historic photographs of the quartet's saxophones that prove it. And now the instruments are ten times more valuable than they were 30 years ago, at least $30,000 apiece! Every morning while he played, Dillon had no idea how wealthy he could've been.\" \"I began thinking about the legend after visiting a local music store called Red's,\" Eric continued with excitement. \"Red knows the history of the neighborhood. He's the one who had given me Dillon's phone number so I could do the interview!\" I wondered if Eric's visit had inadvertently tipped off a saxophone thief. Or if maybe the greedy thief could be Eric himself. Red's seemed like a likely place to investigate. He spoke in a voice that was mellow and relaxed, remembering the talented saxophone quartet and the neighborhood's glory days. \"Now I give music lessons from noon to five,\" he laughed jovially. \"But music is music!\" Red remembered Eric's visit. \"An excitable young kid, that's for sure,\" he laughed, \"but he's right about Dillon's saxophones. There are collectors who'd be willing to pay a lot of money for them.\" Was anyone in the store during Eric's visit? \"There was one customer, but he didn't buy anything. Oldest guy I've ever seen. No hair, bristly moustache, about five feet tall.\" Who was he? \"He owns a lot of buildings in this neighborhood, but he almost never comes around.\" I had one last theory. Back at Dillon's place, I asked the residents about the fire escape. They all agreed that it hadn't worked in years, and couldn't even be lowered to the ground. I searched the ground below the fire escape - a patch of dirt which now contained a small flower bed. It was clear that no one had dropped here from the fire escape, or placed a ladder here to climb up. Had they asked their building manager to repair the fire escape? No one had ever seen him. He holed himself up in his fancy apartment, presumably counting all the money that they'd paid him for rent. After reviewing all the clues, I knocked on Dillon's door, and told him the news. \"Ghosts didn't steal your saxophone. But I know who did.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  How was the apartment entered?  \n    •  The door was still locked and the second-floor window was shut.  \n    •  The fire-escape ladder is broken and no marks were found in the flower bed below it, so no one climbed up.  \n    ➜  Whoever took the horn used a key.\n\n2.  Who owns / can use a key?  \n    •  Dillon himself (obviously)  \n    •  Lenny the grocery boy – he has a copy so he can leave the Friday groceries inside.  \n    •  The building manager/owner – “the manager of this apartment building has a key.”  \n\n3.  Narrowing the list by time and opportunity  \n    •  Lenny’s father will not let him leave the grocery even for a break (“Work all day with no breaks ever!”).  \n       That makes it practically impossible for Lenny to be away during the very hour the theft occurred.  \n    •  The manager is never seen, so *he* can move around without anyone timing him.  \n    •  Nobody else is said to possess a key.\n\n4.  Motive – who has a reason to want the saxophone?  \n    •  Eric (the college student) knows it is worth at least $30 000 but he has no key.  \n    •  Red (the music-store owner) also knows but likewise has no key.   \n    •  Lenny thinks “a saxophone’s nothing in this neighbourhood,” so he shows no interest.  \n    •  The building manager, however, turns out to be the very same *Shorty Jenkins* who originally supplied the quartet with the historic instruments.  \n        – Red describes a customer who was in the store while Eric was talking: “Oldest guy I’ve ever seen, no hair, bristly moustache, about five feet tall … owns a lot of buildings in this neighbourhood.”  \n        – A short, elderly, property-owning man … that perfectly fits the nickname “Shorty.”  \n        – He therefore overheard Eric say the horns are now worth tens of thousands of dollars apiece and realised one of them was still in Dillon’s apartment – to which he still holds the master key.\n\n5.  Putting it together  \n    •  Shorty hears the instruments are enormously valuable.  \n    •  He already possesses a key to Dillon’s flat.  \n    •  When Dillon finishes his daily practice and leaves the horn on its stand, Shorty quietly lets himself in, takes the sax, locks up again and walks away.  \n    •  No forced entry, no need to brave the broken fire escape, no witnesses – everything fits.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nShorty Jenkins (building manager), Lenny the grocery boy, Eric the college student-interviewer, Red the music-store owner\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nShorty “Shorty” Jenkins – the building manager / former music promoter\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOn the morning of the theft, Shorty Jenkins, now the reclusive owner of several neighbourhood buildings (including Dillon’s), visits Red’s music shop.  \nWhile there he overhears Eric telling Red that the four legendary saxophones are now worth at least $30 000 each and that Dillon still owns one of them.  \n\nRealising a small fortune is hanging on the wall of an apartment for which he still keeps a master key, Shorty acts the same afternoon.  \nKnowing Dillon practises every day and then leaves the instrument on its stand, he waits until Dillon finishes and the apartment is quiet.  \nShorty walks to Dillon’s door, unlocks it with his master key, slips inside, removes the saxophone from its stand, and leaves as silently as he came, locking the door behind him.  \nBecause the entry was by key, no window or fire-escape manoeuvre was necessary and no trace was left.  \nShorty then departs with the priceless horn, intending to sell it to a collector who would never question an elderly former music promoter’s title to a vintage instrument.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Lenny the grocery boy – Although he possesses a key, he had no opportunity: his father keeps him working continuously (“no breaks ever”) in the grocery store and we see him there at the time of the investigation.  His attitude (“a saxophone’s nothing”) shows no motive.\n\n•  Eric the college student – He had motive (he learned the sax’s value), but no key and no way to reach the locked second-floor flat without leaving signs.  The theft happened *after* he had already left Dillon and while the windows and fire escape remained untouched.\n\n•  Red the music-store owner – Motive but no key or opportunity; he was still giving paid lessons “from noon to five” and had customers in the shop.\n\nThe only person with both motive (large profit, original connection to the saxophones) and opportunity (possession of the master key, freedom of movement, knowledge Dillon would be out) is Shorty Jenkins, the secretive building manager.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

His tiny room filled with 30-year-old music, fast saxophones rollicking while a bass and a drum kept the beat. \"I didn't know it then,\" Dillon explained, \"but my saxophone also had its own legend.\" The quartet's producer had been a notorious music promoter named Shorty Jenkins. \"Rumor had it Shorty created the careers of some famous musicians -- but then later, destroyed them!\" After twenty years of working the music business, Shorty had the right connections to help acts succeed. But was he also a powerful enemy? \"We did whatever Shorty said,\" Dillon laughed. \"And we did it happily. He picked our songs, wrote our arrangements, and he even lined up the other saxophonists. Within four weeks, somehow Shorty had gotten our record into the stores.\" But then reading a newspaper, Dillon had spotted a disturbing article. \"Shorty was bragging that he'd used the instruments of dead musicians for his new saxophone quartet. Without telling us, he'd given us each the saxophone of a famous jazz artist he'd worked with decades before. Dark whispers spread throughout the clubs. Were we exploiting the artists who came before - or preserving what made them special?\" Dillon stared thoughtfully for a moment. \"That Christmas, our alto saxophonist got real sick. And within two weeks, the baritone saxophonist disappeared. We couldn't continue with just two of us, but Shorty promised he'd find the group a replacement. We found out later he was stuck in a big legal fight with a trumpeter he'd discovered years before. Eventually our third saxophonist found another gig instead. And I never heard from any of them again.\" The vinyl record reached the end of its last song, circling through the static in its final groove until Dillon lifted the needed. \"But now, even my saxophone's gone.\" I'd known about Dillon for years -- he was a local legend in our neighborhood, though his glory days had passed. I'd only met him recently, so I was honored that he requested my help. But I had to know one thing first. \"Do you really think ghosts stole your saxophone?\" \"I've played it every afternoon for the last 30 years, riffing and improvising, while imagining that our band might somehow get back together. And every day, for 30 years, I've left it on that saxophone stand.\" He pointed to empty clasps which had always held his instrument. \"Today an hour after I finished, it was gone.\" Could someone have broken into his apartment? \"The window was closed,\" Dillon insisted, \"and my only door was locked! I live on the second floor, high above the street.\" Did anyone have a key? \"Well, obviously the manager of this apartment building has a key, but we never see him around. But you know who else has a key? The boy at the grocery store on the corner,\" Dillon said casually. \"Every Friday he brings around my groceries, so I don't have to visit his store.\" I got his name, but also took a look at Dillon's window. It was covered with dirt, but the window lifted easily, and opened onto a fire escape. But the fire escape stopped on the second floor, its ladder to the street broken off many years before. It seemed impossible, but I asked Dillon one more question. Had he spoken to anyone before the saxophone disappeared? \"That morning I gave an interview,\" Dillon said proudly. \"A college student was recording the history of music in this neighborhood, and he'd wanted to get my story.\" Dillon gave me his number, and I began my investigation. The grocery store was easy to find, with its stands of fruit on the sidewalk and a busy father/son team who were putting customer orders in bags. It was the son who was Dillon's delivery boy -- a skinny teenager named Lenny. He was struggling to put six tomatoes into a sack. I asked Lenny if he delivered groceries to Dillon. \"Yeah, but mostly because I feel sorry for him,\" he said, weighing the sack of tomatoes on a scale. \"After thirty years, that man has nothing.\" I pointed out Dillon had a valuable antique saxophone. \"A saxophone's nothing in this neighborhood,\" Lenny laughed. \"We haven't had a club with live music here for years.\" As he stacked bundles of carrots into a tall pile, Lenny asked his father if just this once he could take a break, but his father sternly shouted back the family motto -- \"Work all day with no breaks ever!\" It seemed sad that the music scene was dying, so I was even more determined to find the legendary saxophone. I placed a phone call to a college student named Eric, who'd phoned Dillon that morning. \"It's certainly a valuable saxophone,\" his eager voice insisted, \"more valuable than most people know!\" I asked him what he meant. \"Those four saxophones really did come from famous jazz men,\" he said with excitement. \"The group's producer, Shorty Jenkins had worked with the greatest musicians of the century. There are historic photographs of the quartet's saxophones that prove it. And now the instruments are ten times more valuable than they were 30 years ago, at least $30,000 apiece! Every morning while he played, Dillon had no idea how wealthy he could've been.\" \"I began thinking about the legend after visiting a local music store called Red's,\" Eric continued with excitement. \"Red knows the history of the neighborhood. He's the one who had given me Dillon's phone number so I could do the interview!\" I wondered if Eric's visit had inadvertently tipped off a saxophone thief. Or if maybe the greedy thief could be Eric himself. Red's seemed like a likely place to investigate. He spoke in a voice that was mellow and relaxed, remembering the talented saxophone quartet and the neighborhood's glory days. \"Now I give music lessons from noon to five,\" he laughed jovially. \"But music is music!\" Red remembered Eric's visit. \"An excitable young kid, that's for sure,\" he laughed, \"but he's right about Dillon's saxophones. There are collectors who'd be willing to pay a lot of money for them.\" Was anyone in the store during Eric's visit? \"There was one customer, but he didn't buy anything. Oldest guy I've ever seen. No hair, bristly moustache, about five feet tall.\" Who was he? \"He owns a lot of buildings in this neighborhood, but he almost never comes around.\" I had one last theory. Back at Dillon's place, I asked the residents about the fire escape. They all agreed that it hadn't worked in years, and couldn't even be lowered to the ground. I searched the ground below the fire escape - a patch of dirt which now contained a small flower bed. It was clear that no one had dropped here from the fire escape, or placed a ladder here to climb up. Had they asked their building manager to repair the fire escape? No one had ever seen him. He holed himself up in his fancy apartment, presumably counting all the money that they'd paid him for rent. After reviewing all the clues, I knocked on Dillon's door, and told him the news. \"Ghosts didn't steal your saxophone. But I know who did.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Building Manager; (b) Eric; (c) Lenny; (d) Red",
      "answer": "(a) Building Manager",
      "outcome": "\"Only Lenny had a key to my apartment,\" Dillon moaned sadly.\n\"But when could he steal it?\" I pointed out. \"He works with his father all day, and his father never gives him a break.\"\n\"That college student knew that my saxophone was valuable!\"\n\"Yes, but Eric doesn't even know where you live,\" I pointed out. \"He spoke to you over the phone, and he only had your phone number because he talked to Red.\"\n\"Red knows more about music than anyone,\" Dillon said, suspiciously. \"He'd love to get his hands on a $20,000 saxophone.\"\n\"But Red gives music lessons from noon to five,\" I pointed out. \"And anyways, he'd have no way to get into your locked apartment.\"\nDillon was puzzled. \"But then who did?\"\nWe walked out of his apartment and down the hallway to the building manager's room. As we knocked on the door, I finished my story.\n\"Red's music store had a customer last night,\" I said, \"someone who 'owns a lot of buildings.' And the one other person who had a key to your apartment was your building manager.\"\n\"I bet he heard me practicing.\"\n\"I did more than that,\" a voice said, as the door swung open suddenly. \"I recognized the songs.\"\nThe bald, short man, with the bristly moustache stared up at Dillon with a mischievous smile in his eyes. \"You played like you were summoning up a legend, or a ghost.\"\n\"And maybe I did,\" said Dillon. \"Meet Shorty Jenkins!\""
