    "full_text": "Inspector Samuels couldn’t believe his eyes. He stared at the huge man who had just come through the door. He seemed to fill the office all by himself. Why, he was six foot five inches tall at least. “Actually, six foot six,” the man said. “It used to be my nickname, during basketball season. But that was before the football season started. Tech didn’t get many players weighing 265 in those days—that’s when they started calling me Crusher Davis.” “I can certainly see why,” Inspector Samuels blurted out. “What I don’t follow is this ‘Ask Martha’ business. The call from the Chronicle said that the reporter from the advice column—what we used to call the agony column—was on the way to see me. Martha. Everyone knows that is Martha somebody. Seems like everybody reads that column now. I mean, my wife tells me it’s interesting and well written.” “This has to be our secret, Inspector. I was a journalism major, and jobs are hard to come by. The Chronicle had an opening, but the person hired had to cover a number of items: City Hall, sports, local crime, and, oh yes, the advice column. Piece of cake for me, except for the advice column. It seems the Chronicle had dropped the syndicated column it used to run, to save money. That’s how I started to write ‘Ask Martha.’ “Funny how things work out. I got used to it after a few weeks. Having had two older sisters helped. And in high school, everyone was always coming to me with their problems, and I got into the habit of listening closely. That’s all most people want, anyway, and it does seem to help. So writing the column wasn’t really much of a stretch, and it does seem to have caught on. “But please, this must be our secret. For the time being, anyway, until somebody else starts writing the column.” “Whatever works.” Inspector Samuels was not about to argue with this giant. And besides, Crusher was here because he had offered to be of help with Samuels’ latest annoyance, a messy littering outbreak that had enraged half the city, and all of the taxpayers. “So what do you know about this littering?” “What everybody else knows: That it is widespread, messy, and deliberate. But I know something else. Based on the letters I received this morning, I think I can tell you either who did it, or give you the clue that will help solve the case. But I don’t want my cover as Martha to be blown. I’d be the laughingstock of the town! So what do you say to my giving you the facts anonymously, Inspector, and you figure it out? That way, Martha won’t enter into it, and I’ll keep my anonymity—and my job.” “You’re on, Mar—err, I mean Crusher.” “Good. There are four letters, Inspector. They all contain clues, and looked at closely, one might even tell us who is the litterer. I wouldn’t be surprised if that letter still had some fingerprints, or if the sender had licked the envelope flap to seal it, leaving some DNA. Too bad we can’t get that with stamps anymore. Now they are all stick-on, not licked. But there should be enough here to nail the litterer.” “Go ahead. I’m all ears.” “The first letter is signed Concerned Neighbor, who has this to say: ‘Every morning I go out to get the newspaper, about 6:45, and for the past week, it’s been getting worse. There is litter all around Maple Street, where I live. Some blew onto my lawn yesterday, and it looked like food wrappings of some sort, maybe fast food, with traces of what looked like mustard and ketchup. This is disgusting. What do we pay taxes for, anyway? The local police must be asleep at the switch.’ Concerned Neighbor then asks my opinion on whether he should organize a neighborhod patrol of some sort.” “Interesting. And the second letter?” “It’s from Smug in Suburbia. Smug lives in a gated community, which is locked up at night. Anyone leaving or entering the community from nine at night through seven in the morning has to go through security.” “So what’s he so smug about?” “He says, like Concerned Neighbor, that the problem behind the littering is the lack of proper police protection. But he offers a different solution. Hire more police, he says, and the problem would be solved. He admits that it would also lower the community association dues he and others now have to pay for their own private protection, but he says that’s only fair. He is a taxpaying citizen like everyone else. That is a cause that Martha should explore, he adds. He says that he is neat as a pin himself, and can’t abide litter. It’s a real health and safety issue.” “Makes a kind of sense. Who else is weighing in?” “It’s Perplexed Dog Walker. This is probably an animal rights person, and the letter, unlike the first two, is handwritten. It looks like a woman’s handwriting. Anyway, she goes out and walks her dog whenever the dog needs to go—no waiting until the morning. She is writing because she actually saw the littering happen. It was along the route she walks her dog, along Elm as it leads into Maple. She saw litter being thrown out of the front window of a car, the driver’s side, and not just once, but repeatedly. “She admits that she is not always careful with her own trash, the odd chewing gum wrapper, that sort of thing. But this was large scale, and shocking. There was no way that it was not deliberate. She says it must have been about one o’clock in the morning or so. She signs herself Perplexed, because she can’t understand why anyone would do this. Like Concerned Neighbor, she wants Martha to advise her about forming a community association of some sort, to patrol the area. She adds that she has been thinking of selling her home, and the housing market is bad enough without some idiot lowering property values with this littering campaign.” “Did she get a good look at the car?” “The car was a full block away, and it was fairly dark out, so she didn’t get a good look.” “I’m dying to find out what the fourth letter says.” “It’s from Confused Commuter. This one is also handwritten, a man’s handwriting. The writer says that he and his wife came home late one night from our state capital, after watching their son play tournament basketball. Their son’s team had lost, so he was in a very bad mood. They stopped at a fast food restaurant on Route 12—you know, that strip just outside of town—for a late night snack. He writes that he saw someone in the back, behind the restaurant, stealing one of the garbage containers that had been taken out for emptying into the dumpster when the night shift changed. He wrote Martha because he said he didn’t want to get involved in a police matter. They went home immediately from the restaurant.” “I think I’ve got it, Crusher. Many thanks, and your secret is safe with me. I look forward to your behind the scenes help with more cases as they come your way.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What kind of rubbish is being strewn about?  \n   – Fast-food wrappings still smeared with mustard and ketchup.\n\n2. Where could a large quantity of that kind of garbage be obtained every night?  \n   – Out of the trash bins a fast-food restaurant wheels to the rear service lane when the shift changes.\n\n3. Which of the four letter–writers shows knowledge that could only be possessed by someone who was actually behind the restaurant?  \n   – Confused Commuter: he claims he “saw someone … behind the restaurant stealing one of the garbage containers that had been taken out for emptying into the dumpster.”\n\n   A normal customer never goes behind the restaurant; from the dining room or drive-through that area is invisible.  If he could describe the theft, he had to be back there himself.\n\n4. Opportunity and time-line  \n   – Confused Commuter was on the road late at night, returning from the ball-game.  \n   – Perplexed Dog Walker saw the littering at about 1 a.m., the same hour Confused Commuter was driving home.  \n   – She saw litter flung repeatedly from the DRIVER’S window—exactly what a lone male driver would do while his wife slept or stared straight ahead.\n\n5. Motive  \n   – He was in a foul mood after his son’s defeat; stealing a bin and “sharing” the mess was an easy, anonymous way to vent his anger.  Once the story hit the papers he tried to cover himself by writing the “witness” letter to Ask Martha, stressing that he “didn’t want to get involved with the police.”\n\n6. Physical evidence  \n   – Fingerprints or DNA on the garbage can that disappeared from the restaurant.  \n   – Security cameras on Route 12 may show his car in the rear service lane.  \n   – Wrappers found on Maple/Elm will match the batch code and time stamp printed on the bags used at that restaurant that night.\n\nAll the other correspondents simply complain or report what they saw; none displays forbidden knowledge.  The single slip made by Confused Commuter is enough for Inspector Samuels to “have it.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nConcerned Neighbor, Smug in Suburbia, Perplexed Dog Walker, Confused Commuter\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nConfused Commuter (real name not yet known)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter leaving the state-capital basketball tournament late at night, Confused Commuter and his wife stopped at a fast-food outlet on Route 12.  Still seething over his son’s loss, he drove round the back of the restaurant, where he spotted (and promptly stole) one of the kitchen garbage cans that had just been wheeled out at the change of shift.  He hefted the container into, or partially into, his car and headed home.  \n\nAs he drove through Elm Street onto Maple at about 1 a.m. he rolled down the left-hand (driver’s) window and, handful after handful, flung the greasy wrappers and cartons into the darkened neighbourhood.  He repeated the performance on several successive nights, each time picking up more trash at the same restaurant, which explains why the mess “kept getting worse.”\n\nWhen the litter-storm hit the Chronicle he tried to distance himself by writing to “Ask Martha,” portraying himself as a mere witness to “someone” else stealing the garbage can and protesting that he “didn’t want to get involved with the police.”  Unfortunately for him, only the thief could have known a bin had been removed from behind the restaurant, and that single fact allowed Inspector Samuels to zero in on him.  Dog Walker’s description of a lone driver tossing trash, the type of refuse itself, and the time-line seal the case.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Concerned Neighbor: Observed the mess only in the morning; no evidence he was out at 1 a.m. or had access to restaurant trash.  \n• Smug in Suburbia: Would have had to pass a staffed security gate to leave his community between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.; gate records will show he stayed home.  \n• Perplexed Dog Walker: Is the principal eyewitness; her account is corroborated by the physical evidence and by the time-line; nothing links her to restaurant garbage.  \n\nThus the only person with means, motive, opportunity, and insider knowledge is Confused Commuter—the litterer Inspector Samuels was looking for.",

    "reveal_text": "The four letters together give a picture of the littering. Confused Commuter saw the litterer stealing a full trash container from behind a fast food restaurant. (He was with his wife, and went home immediately, so could not be guilty of sustained littering.) Concerned Neighbor saw the litter on his own block early in the morning. (A litterer would be very unlikely to strew trash all over his block, some of which would go onto his own lawn.) Perplexed Dog Walker saw that it was a repeated action, large scale. (Since she was trying to sell her own house, she would not litter the neighborhood and lower her own property’s value even more.)\nThat leaves the actual litterer, Smug in Suburbia. He wants to stop paying for private police protection at his gated community, and believes that his littering campaign will drive the city to hiring more people. We would not be surprised if he also plans to buy depressed properties in the neighborhoods where he has littered. The police will be helped by the records of the security guards at his gated community. Every night, they will have clocked him in and out, as he left the community for his littering campaign. The letter from Smug in Suburbia, even if it does not contain fingerprints or DNA—which would itself be a highly suspicious development—will soon be matched against those security records.",

Some blew onto my lawn yesterday, and it looked like food wrappings of some sort, maybe fast food, with traces of what looked like mustard and ketchup. This is disgusting. What do we pay taxes for, anyway? The local police must be asleep at the switch.’ Concerned Neighbor then asks my opinion on whether he should organize a neighborhod patrol of some sort.” “Interesting. And the second letter?” “It’s from Smug in Suburbia. Smug lives in a gated community, which is locked up at night. Anyone leaving or entering the community from nine at night through seven in the morning has to go through security.” “So what’s he so smug about?” “He says, like Concerned Neighbor, that the problem behind the littering is the lack of proper police protection. But he offers a different solution. Hire more police, he says, and the problem would be solved. He admits that it would also lower the community association dues he and others now have to pay for their own private protection, but he says that’s only fair. He is a taxpaying citizen like everyone else. That is a cause that Martha should explore, he adds. He says that he is neat as a pin himself, and can’t abide litter. It’s a real health and safety issue.” “Makes a kind of sense. Who else is weighing in?” “It’s Perplexed Dog Walker. This is probably an animal rights person, and the letter, unlike the first two, is handwritten. It looks like a woman’s handwriting. Anyway, she goes out and walks her dog whenever the dog needs to go—no waiting until the morning. She is writing because she actually saw the littering happen. It was along the route she walks her dog, along Elm as it leads into Maple. She saw litter being thrown out of the front window of a car, the driver’s side, and not just once, but repeatedly. “She admits that she is not always careful with her own trash, the odd chewing gum wrapper, that sort of thing. But this was large scale, and shocking. There was no way that it was not deliberate. She says it must have been about one o’clock in the morning or so. She signs herself Perplexed, because she can’t understand why anyone would do this. Like Concerned Neighbor, she wants Martha to advise her about forming a community association of some sort, to patrol the area. She adds that she has been thinking of selling her home, and the housing market is bad enough without some idiot lowering property values with this littering campaign.” “Did she get a good look at the car?” “The car was a full block away, and it was fairly dark out, so she didn’t get a good look.” “I’m dying to find out what the fourth letter says.” “It’s from Confused Commuter. This one is also handwritten, a man’s handwriting. The writer says that he and his wife came home late one night from our state capital, after watching their son play tournament basketball. Their son’s team had lost, so he was in a very bad mood. They stopped at a fast food restaurant on Route 12—you know, that strip just outside of town—for a late night snack. He writes that he saw someone in the back, behind the restaurant, stealing one of the garbage containers that had been taken out for emptying into the dumpster when the night shift changed. He wrote Martha because he said he didn’t want to get involved in a police matter. They went home immediately from the restaurant.” “I think I’ve got it, Crusher. Many thanks, and your secret is safe with me. I look forward to your behind the scenes help with more cases as they come your way.”",

      "answer": "(d) Smug in Suburbia",
      "outcome": "The four letters together give a picture of the littering. Confused Commuter saw the litterer stealing a full trash container from behind a fast food restaurant. (He was with his wife, and went home immediately, so could not be guilty of sustained littering.) Concerned Neighbor saw the litter on his own block early in the morning. (A litterer would be very unlikely to strew trash all over his block, some of which would go onto his own lawn.) Perplexed Dog Walker saw that it was a repeated action, large scale. (Since she was trying to sell her own house, she would not litter the neighborhood and lower her own property’s value even more.)\nThat leaves the actual litterer, Smug in Suburbia. He wants to stop paying for private police protection at his gated community, and believes that his littering campaign will drive the city to hiring more people. We would not be surprised if he also plans to buy depressed properties in the neighborhoods where he has littered. The police will be helped by the records of the security guards at his gated community. Every night, they will have clocked him in and out, as he left the community for his littering campaign. The letter from Smug in Suburbia, even if it does not contain fingerprints or DNA—which would itself be a highly suspicious development—will soon be matched against those security records."
