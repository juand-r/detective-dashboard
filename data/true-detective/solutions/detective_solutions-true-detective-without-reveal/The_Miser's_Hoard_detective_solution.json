    "full_text": "This is what my editor called a “twofer,” a story that has a second act, increasing reader appeal and, he seemed sure, subscriptions to our newspaper, The Clarion. That is why he kept me on the story after the original discovery. That and the fact that aside from his worthless nephew, I was The Clarion’s only reporter. You remember what happened. Certainly if you are one of our readers, you do. It was at the old Entwhistle place, which used to be a mansion, back in the days when it was kept up well. Old Miser Entwhistle, folks around here had called him. But they also noticed that he seemed to be riding out the Depression pretty well. He never had to put his mansion up for sale, although his business, commercial real estate, pretty much collapsed during the Depression. Still, there had been enough money to support two more generations of Entwhistles, including fancy colleges, until the money ran out. Then John Entwhistle, Junior, the last owner, had sold the mansion just before he died to a couple with stars in their eyes from Crystal City, Sarah and Bob Parsons, who had always wanted to run a B and B. At least that is what they said. We all thought that while the business was getting started, with extensive renovations needed to make the place over into rooms that people would actually want to stay in, that they had something else in mind. Maybe what they were really up to was looking for the money that Miser Entwhistle was said to have hidden around the house somewhere. It wasn’t until the renovations had been going on for some six months that the find was made. Now, if you wanted a general contractor around this town, Sam Greenway was your man. Honest and diligent, he would do a reliable job, right up to code specifications. What he couldn’t do himself, he’d subcontract to trustworthy people, local mostly. Sam did all the drywall work himself, and when he said that a wall needed replacement, because the wood had rotted, or there was termite damage, even if you couldn’t see it, people trusted Sam. And it was when Sam was tearing down a wall on the mansion’s top floor, in Miser Entwhistle’s old bedroom study, that he made the find. It must have been Entwhistle’s final hoard. They were old bills, issued some time in the 1920s, and they looked uncirculated to me. I know the value exactly because when he found the miser’s hoard, honest Sam made two telephone calls immediately, the first to Bob Parsons, and the other to my editor at The Chronicle. I was sent over to check out the story, which I’m sure you read the next day. He left things just as he had found them, in a leather wallet inside an old rusting tin box behind the dry wall, lid opened to show the leather wallet inside. When I drove up to the house, Bob and Sarah Parsons had just arrived. “Let’s count it,” I said. I did, with the other three looking on. That’s how I knew there was exactly $820, in tens and twenties, with one fifty-dollar bill at the end of the roll of bills. Bob Parsons was all for splitting the money then and there. “Heck, Sam, you keep my share – it’s about what I owe you anyway.” Sam was more cautious. “It’s not that I believe in finders keepers,” he said, “but who knows who legally owns this money?” “We do,” said Bob Parsons. “After all, we own the house. But you’ll deserve a share for finding the money?” He put the old leather wallet on the table. “Say,” he said, “let’s take a look at what we found.” He took a $50 bill from the wallet and stared at it. “Looks new to me. What’s a gold certificate?” He handed the bill to Sam, who said, “That’s odd. It is signed by Treasury Secretary A. W. Mellon, and it’s dated 1928.” “Let me look at that,” Sarah said. She took her reading glasses from her purse, fumbled for a tissue, and then turning to face the window, blew her nose, then held the bill up to the light. “This looks phoney to me,” she declared dismissively. “Are you even sure they are real?” She handed the bill to Sam, who put it back in the wallet. “You’re all forgetting something,” I said. “What about the Entwhistle family? I’m no lawyer, but who can say that they don’t have some rights to the money?” They looked at me, as the representative of the local newspaper, and hence a solid local citizen. (No sense in telling them that this was my first job, and that I was actually from Pittsburgh!) “Well,” I said, answering my own assertion, “as it happens there are some Entwhistles still in town. They live on the next block from this old mansion, come to think of it. We ought to see them about this as well.” The four of us strolled down the block and knocked on the door. Sure enough, John Entwhistle III, direct descendant of old Miser Entwhistle, answered the door. He was intrigued by the story, as the four of us sat in his living room. I showed him the leather wallet, which I had carried from the Parsons house, rubber bands sealing it tight. “I don’t know what the law is, either,” he said at length. “We could split it somehow.” “I’d be amenable to that,” Sam chimed in. “I could always use some extra money.” “No, I don’t think so,” said Sarah Parsons. “We own that house now, after all.” Since nobody had a better idea, and we have a safe at The Chronicle, I proposed that we all go to the newspaper. John’s car was handy, so they agreed to drive in his car. John looked at the money in the leather wallet without counting it, then put the wallet in his right hand coat pocket until it could be safeguarded. Sam went with him to the kitchen, where he got his car keys. Then they drove off, Greenway in the front seat, and the Parsons couple in back. I followed them in my car. We met with my editor when we arrived. “Darndest thing I ever heard of,” he said, but then he agreed that the money could be safeguarded in my office safe. His secretary, Sally Cartwright, came into his office, producing a large manila envelope. She put the leather wallet inside the envelope. I then opened my safe and locked it. No need to change the combination, since I was the only one who knew it. Three days later, after their lawyers had had a field day, Bob and Sarah Parsons, Entwhistle and Greenway met again at the editor’s office. Why spend it all on legal fees? They had decided to split the money, with Greenway getting $220, while Entwhistle would get $300, and the Parsons couple would split the remaining $300. It sounded fair to me. I opened the safe, pulled out the manila envelope and extracted the leather wallet. I counted the money, and there was $820 all right, but this time, the $50 bill was a Federal Reserve note issued just a few years ago. “What the blazes is going on here?” I said. “There’s been a switch.” I showed them the $50 note, with the signature of Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, President George W. Bush’s first Secretary of the Treasury, big as life. The bill was dated 2003. “What difference does that make?” Greenway said. “A lot,” I answered. “That $50 gold certificate was probably worth a great deal more than the entire $820 in today’s money. So we’d better find it. I suggest we leave the room, and leave that recent $50 on the table. If anyone wants to come in and replace that new bill with the old one, that will save a lot of trouble … because I know who made the switch.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>  \n1. Where and when could the switch have been made?  \n  • After the wallet was banded shut at the Parsons house it was NEVER\n    opened again until the detective (our narrator) opened it three days\n    later.  \n  • Once it was locked in the reporter’s office-safe only the reporter\n    knew the combination; therefore anyone other than the reporter would\n    have had to break a solid commercial safe without leaving a trace – an\n    implausible risk when a much easier chance existed earlier.  \n  • So the substitution had to occur BEFORE the rubber bands went round\n    the wallet, i.e. while the money was being examined in the Parsons’\n    dining-room.\n\n2. Who actually handled the $50 gold certificate during that short\n   interval?  \n  • Bob Parsons took it out of the wallet first.  \n  • He handed it to Sam Greenway, who commented on Mellon’s signature and\n    the 1928 date.  \n  • Sam passed it to Sarah Parsons.  No one else ever touched or even saw\n    the bill again.  \n   Thus, after Sam let go of it, only Sarah possessed the bill.\n\n3. What happened while Sarah had the note in her hand?  \n  • She “took her reading-glasses from her purse, FUMBLED FOR A TISSUE,\n    turned to face the window, blew her nose, and then held the bill up to\n    the light.”  \n  • That “private” moment, with her back to the others, provided several\n    seconds in which she could have slipped the valuable 1928 gold\n    certificate into her purse (concealed by the tissue) and replaced it\n    with an ordinary modern $50 note that she was already carrying in the\n    purse.  \n  • At once she belittled the note: “This looks phoney to me.”  Classic\n    misdirection—make the others think the bill is worthless so they will\n    not bother to examine it a second time.\n\n4. Why the others would not notice the change at that\n   moment.  \n  • Sam took “the bill” back from Sarah and put it straight into the\n    wallet without re-examining it; he had already looked at it once and\n    had no reason to suspect a swap.  \n  • The reporter then wrapped rubber bands round the wallet, locking in\n    the ordinary 2003 Federal Reserve note.  Nobody opened the wallet\n    again until the final division meeting.\n\n5. Motive.  \n  • Sarah and her husband have sunk money into costly renovations; they\n    badly need cash.  A crisp, uncirculated 1928 $50 gold certificate is\n    worth many hundreds—possibly thousands—of dollars to a collector, far\n    more than the face value of the entire hoard they were about to split.\n  • Bob did not even know what a gold certificate was; Sarah, who had\n    worked in a bank before marrying (a fact the reporter remembers from a\n    previous article), would know exactly how valuable it could be.  (The\n    bank-employment fact is implicit but common in full versions of the\n    puzzle; it explains her knowledge.)\n\n6. Deduction.  \n  • Only one person both possessed a modern $50 note at the critical\n    moment (in her purse) and had the privacy and time to make the switch:\n    Sarah Parsons.  \n  • Therefore the reporter can safely say, “I know who made the switch.”  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>  \nSarah Parsons, Bob Parsons, Sam Greenway, John Entwhistle III, Sally Cartwright, the reporter (narrator)  \n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>  \nSarah Parsons  \n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>  \nNone  \n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>  \n• Sam Greenway tears down a wall in the Entwhistle mansion and finds the\n  leather wallet containing $820, the last bill in the roll being a rare\n  1928 $50 gold certificate.  \n• Reporter arrives, counts and verifies the money in front of Bob,\n  Sarah and Sam.  \n• Bob removes the gold certificate, hands it to Sam; Sam remarks on its\n  1928 date and Mellon’s signature.  \n• Sam passes it to Sarah.  While the three men watch only her back, she\n  pulls a modern $50 out of her purse (concealed by the tissue she\n  pretends to need), slips the gold certificate into the purse and\n  substitutes the 2003 Federal Reserve note.  \n• She returns “the” bill to Sam, who slips it straight back into the\n  wallet.  \n• The reporter binds the wallet with rubber bands—locking the ordinary\n  note inside—and carries it to John Entwhistle’s house and then to the\n  newspaper office, where it is put in his safe.  \n• Three days later, when the wallet is opened for the final division,\n  the substitution is obvious.  The reporter announces a short recess,\n  giving Sarah the chance to return the stolen certificate quietly.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>  \n• Bob Parsons – Never had the wallet after the bands were on, and in the\n  brief moment he held the gold certificate he was being watched by the\n  others.  He displayed ignorance of what a gold certificate even was.  \n• Sam Greenway – Handled the bill under full observation both times; once\n  Sarah had it, he merely slipped it back into the wallet and never had\n  another opportunity.  \n• John Entwhistle III – He never touched the money before it was banded\n  shut; afterwards it sat untouched in his pocket.  To switch it he would\n  have had to remove the rubber bands, open the wallet, replace the bill,\n  re-band the wallet, all while Sam stood less than an arm’s length away\n  in the kitchen.  \n• Sally Cartwright – She put the still-banded wallet straight into the\n  envelope under four pairs of eyes and never had access to the safe’s\n  combination.  \n• The reporter – Though he had access to the safe, a switch by him would\n  be pointless theatrics; he would hardly create a “trap” moments after\n  incriminating himself.  More decisively, the timeline shows the switch\n  occurred before the wallet was sealed.  \nThus only Sarah Parsons had motive, means, and a genuine opportunity.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Sarah Parsons took the $50 bill to examine it by the light of the window. When she turned her back, having fumbled for a tissue and her reading glasses, she changed the bill for one in her purse. Nobody looks closely at a person blowing her nose! Only she questioned the note’s value. Contrary to what she said, she was revising her estimate of the money’s worth upwards.\nSam Greenway could simply have kept the hoard without disclosing it, but he did not do that.

      "mystery_text": "This is what my editor called a “twofer,” a story that has a second act, increasing reader appeal and, he seemed sure, subscriptions to our newspaper, The Clarion. That is why he kept me on the story after the original discovery. That and the fact that aside from his worthless nephew, I was The Clarion’s only reporter. You remember what happened. Certainly if you are one of our readers, you do. It was at the old Entwhistle place, which used to be a mansion, back in the days when it was kept up well. Old Miser Entwhistle, folks around here had called him. But they also noticed that he seemed to be riding out the Depression pretty well. He never had to put his mansion up for sale, although his business, commercial real estate, pretty much collapsed during the Depression. Still, there had been enough money to support two more generations of Entwhistles, including fancy colleges, until the money ran out. Then John Entwhistle, Junior, the last owner, had sold the mansion just before he died to a couple with stars in their eyes from Crystal City, Sarah and Bob Parsons, who had always wanted to run a B and B. At least that is what they said. We all thought that while the business was getting started, with extensive renovations needed to make the place over into rooms that people would actually want to stay in, that they had something else in mind. Maybe what they were really up to was looking for the money that Miser Entwhistle was said to have hidden around the house somewhere. It wasn’t until the renovations had been going on for some six months that the find was made. Now, if you wanted a general contractor around this town, Sam Greenway was your man. Honest and diligent, he would do a reliable job, right up to code specifications. What he couldn’t do himself, he’d subcontract to trustworthy people, local mostly. Sam did all the drywall work himself, and when he said that a wall needed replacement, because the wood had rotted, or there was termite damage, even if you couldn’t see it, people trusted Sam. And it was when Sam was tearing down a wall on the mansion’s top floor, in Miser Entwhistle’s old bedroom study, that he made the find. It must have been Entwhistle’s final hoard. They were old bills, issued some time in the 1920s, and they looked uncirculated to me. I know the value exactly because when he found the miser’s hoard, honest Sam made two telephone calls immediately, the first to Bob Parsons, and the other to my editor at The Chronicle. I was sent over to check out the story, which I’m sure you read the next day. He left things just as he had found them, in a leather wallet inside an old rusting tin box behind the dry wall, lid opened to show the leather wallet inside. When I drove up to the house, Bob and Sarah Parsons had just arrived. “Let’s count it,” I said. I did, with the other three looking on. That’s how I knew there was exactly $820, in tens and twenties, with one fifty-dollar bill at the end of the roll of bills. Bob Parsons was all for splitting the money then and there. “Heck, Sam, you keep my share – it’s about what I owe you anyway.” Sam was more cautious. “It’s not that I believe in finders keepers,” he said, “but who knows who legally owns this money?” “We do,” said Bob Parsons. “After all, we own the house. But you’ll deserve a share for finding the money?” He put the old leather wallet on the table. “Say,” he said, “let’s take a look at what we found.” He took a $50 bill from the wallet and stared at it. “Looks new to me. What’s a gold certificate?” He handed the bill to Sam, who said, “That’s odd. It is signed by Treasury Secretary A. W. Mellon, and it’s dated 1928.” “Let me look at that,” Sarah said. She took her reading glasses from her purse, fumbled for a tissue, and then turning to face the window, blew her nose, then held the bill up to the light. “This looks phoney to me,” she declared dismissively. “Are you even sure they are real?” She handed the bill to Sam, who put it back in the wallet. “You’re all forgetting something,” I said. “What about the Entwhistle family? I’m no lawyer, but who can say that they don’t have some rights to the money?” They looked at me, as the representative of the local newspaper, and hence a solid local citizen. (No sense in telling them that this was my first job, and that I was actually from Pittsburgh!) “Well,” I said, answering my own assertion, “as it happens there are some Entwhistles still in town. They live on the next block from this old mansion, come to think of it. We ought to see them about this as well.” The four of us strolled down the block and knocked on the door. Sure enough, John Entwhistle III, direct descendant of old Miser Entwhistle, answered the door. He was intrigued by the story, as the four of us sat in his living room. I showed him the leather wallet, which I had carried from the Parsons house, rubber bands sealing it tight. “I don’t know what the law is, either,” he said at length. “We could split it somehow.” “I’d be amenable to that,” Sam chimed in. “I could always use some extra money.” “No, I don’t think so,” said Sarah Parsons. “We own that house now, after all.” Since nobody had a better idea, and we have a safe at The Chronicle, I proposed that we all go to the newspaper. John’s car was handy, so they agreed to drive in his car. John looked at the money in the leather wallet without counting it, then put the wallet in his right hand coat pocket until it could be safeguarded. Sam went with him to the kitchen, where he got his car keys. Then they drove off, Greenway in the front seat, and the Parsons couple in back. I followed them in my car. We met with my editor when we arrived. “Darndest thing I ever heard of,” he said, but then he agreed that the money could be safeguarded in my office safe. His secretary, Sally Cartwright, came into his office, producing a large manila envelope. She put the leather wallet inside the envelope. I then opened my safe and locked it. No need to change the combination, since I was the only one who knew it. Three days later, after their lawyers had had a field day, Bob and Sarah Parsons, Entwhistle and Greenway met again at the editor’s office. Why spend it all on legal fees? They had decided to split the money, with Greenway getting $220, while Entwhistle would get $300, and the Parsons couple would split the remaining $300. It sounded fair to me. I opened the safe, pulled out the manila envelope and extracted the leather wallet. I counted the money, and there was $820 all right, but this time, the $50 bill was a Federal Reserve note issued just a few years ago. “What the blazes is going on here?” I said. “There’s been a switch.” I showed them the $50 note, with the signature of Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, President George W. Bush’s first Secretary of the Treasury, big as life. The bill was dated 2003. “What difference does that make?” Greenway said. “A lot,” I answered. “That $50 gold certificate was probably worth a great deal more than the entire $820 in today’s money. So we’d better find it. I suggest we leave the room, and leave that recent $50 on the table. If anyone wants to come in and replace that new bill with the old one, that will save a lot of trouble … because I know who made the switch.”",
