    "full_text": "When Martin Caldwell got to his office on Monday morning, he felt as if he had just left minutes ago. Being a city detective called for long and sometimes boring investigations that often led nowhere. He had only had four hours of sleep and when he looked in the mirror in the men's room, he could tell it. With the bags under his eyes along with the weight he had gained he looked like a basset hound. What hair he had left was sprinkled with gray and his blue eyes were so red that they looked like a Florida road map. Along with his rumpled suit he had spilled coffee and mustard on his white shirt, but he couldn't seem to make himself care. \"Maybe nothing will happen today and I can steal a short nap,” he thought. He had closed the door and settled back in his chair with his feet on the desk when the phone began ringing. He let it trill on a few times hoping it would stop, but knowing it wouldn't. \"Detective Caldwell, I'm glad you finally made it to work this morning, and just in time too, there's been a bank robbery\" the deep voice said. Martin recognized the voice of Chief Jennings and started to protest, but having been on this earth for fifty-one years and knowing the chief, said only, \"where and when?” The chief told him that Macon Central Savings had been robbed only thirty minutes ago, about 9:47 a.m. He was to go and interview the witnesses and talk to the security guard about the heist. \"Maybe this will be quick and I can go home,” he thought. The bank was fairly new, having been built only two years ago in 1974 and he knew it well because he had a small retirement account there. Thus he was acquainted with the personnel and the bank president, Mr. Riley. When he entered, Mrs. Parker was sitting in one of the chairs along the wall and was being consoled by a pretty young Oriental girl that Martin recognized as a recently hired teller. In her sixty's and spry as ever, Mrs. Parker seemed relieved to see the detective and began telling what happened. \"I was alone up front behind the tellers counter when the thief suddenly burst in without saying a word and handed me a note, saying to put all of the money in the bag that he was carrying.\" Martin lifted his head and asked, \"did you say he?” Mrs. Parker smiled and answered, \"well, I'm not sure of course, because the thief didn't say a word and was wearing a hood and gloves that concealed his features. He just handed me the note and brandished a pistol at me, so I stuffed all of the money in the bag and then the robber ran out the door.” Martin also discovered that the security video wasn't operating and was being replaced by a newer system. Having gleaned everything of importance from Mrs. Parker, including the description of medium height and weight, a description that would fit a lot of people, he went looking for the security guard, a guy named Bill Thomas. Bill, who used to work at police headquarters but retired and now worked part time at the bank, was coming out of the bank president’s office and saw that Martin had arrived. \"Hey Bill, let me guess, you were in the john and didn't see anything, right?” Martin and Bill were old friends and had shared many cases together so they knew each other well. \"Aw, come on Martin, you know my routine so well that you already knew that. But I did get out in time to see the car speeding away and it was a 1976 Porsche 911, burgundy in color. I've never seen one that color before but that's what it was. My nephew has a 911 and I couldn't be mistaken.” Martin told Bill that he would talk to him later and went to use the phone. When Martin called the Department of Motor vehicles, he found out that there were only five 911's in the whole country that matched that description. All of them sold in Macon at the local dealership. When someone made a special order for the burgundy color a mistake was made and five were shipped and sold in 1976. The only difference in them was that one had an automatic transmissions and the others all had manual shifters which entailed using a clutch. Bill hadn't noticed the difference so Martin got the phone numbers of the owners and asked them to come down to the bank. He hoped that one of them wouldn't show up and maybe narrow the field, but they all agreed to come. Frankie Cole was the first to arrive because he worked at the nearby airport and just had a short commute. He was working in one of the back hangars as a mechanic but he was working alone and didn't have an alibi. His car was shiny and clean with a manual shifter and purred like a kitten when running. He seemed like an honest guy, but in this business you never knew. He was the right size but so far that didn't mean anything Amy Golden, a housewife and mother pulled in beside Frankie and shut off her motor. Her car also had a manual shifter and was identical except for a small faded decal in the rear window. She too seemed very pleasant. Again, the size matched. Although they were not with her at the time of the robbery, her aunt and uncle would vouch for her character she said and gave Martin their phone number. The third to arrive was Susan Barker who worked for Dr. Pitts down the road. She was indignant about having to leave her job to be interviewed and swore that she was working when the bank was robbed. She was a little larger in build than the other two but not much. Again, she had an identical car. Like the first two cars, the shifter had the H pattern on it with the numbers one through four and a reverse to the side. Jeremy Steele, a pimpled-faced young man was angry to have to come over for questioning. His girlfriend, a plump young blond named Tammy, drove him to the bank. When asked why Tammy drove him in, Jeremy pointed to the signature-covered cast on his left foot and said that he could not work the clutch with his broken foot. Unfortunately, Tammy was not able to vouch for his whereabouts at the time of the robbery. The last suspect to arrive was a young black college student named Lionel Jackson, who was on the way to school and didn't have a solid alibi either. His car was in perfect shape like the others. Very polite and, you guessed it, medium build and weight. Martin sat in the car and looked at the familiar PRNDL that was short for park, reverse, neutral, drive and low gears. Nothing was ever easy it seemed in these cases. Shaking his head, Martin walked back over to Bill and asked him what view he had of the car while it was racing away. \" I was running up behind it when the thief cranked up and sped off. But I'm sure that it didn't have anything on the rear window.” Martin trusted Bill's eyewitness account because of Bill's police training. \" Martin looked at the empty parking space behind the bank president's car and asked, \"did the thief put the car in reverse before leaving the parking space, or just go straight ahead?\" Bill frowned and thought for a moment before answering, \"nope, not a flicker of the back up lights, so no, no reverse.” After thinking about all of the testimonies of the suspects he said to Bill. \"Do you still have your old set of rusty handcuffs, I left mine at the station?” Bill smiled and said, \" So you know who did it huh?” Martin said. \"Sometimes you get lucky.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Start with the only hard piece of physical evidence: the getaway car – a burgundy-red 1976 Porsche 911.  \n   • DMV records show only five cars in the country that match.  \n2. List the five owners that were summoned:  \n   • Frankie Cole – manual transmission, no markings on the rear window.  \n   • Amy Golden – manual, BUT a faded decal on her back window.  \n   • Susan Barker – manual, no decal mentioned.  \n   • Jeremy Steele – manual, but he presently has a broken LEFT foot in a cast; the left foot is essential for the clutch.  \n   • Lionel Jackson – the only AUTOMATIC-transmission car (PRNDL on the selector).  \n\n3. Bill Thomas (retired cop, now the bank guard) supplies two critical observations.  \n   a) He was directly behind the Porsche when the robber started the engine and drove away. Nothing was stuck on, painted on, or hanging in the rear window.  \n   b) He never saw even “a flicker” of back-up lights; the car left its space straight ahead without ever being put into REVERSE.  \n\n4. What do the back-up lights tell us?  \n   • If the Porsche had AUTOMATIC transmission, the driver would have had to shift from PARK → REVERSE → NEUTRAL → DRIVE. Even if the car never moved backward, the selector has to pass through REVERSE and the reverse lights would blink for an instant.  \n   • Because Bill saw no such flicker, the robber’s Porsche must have been one of the four MANUAL-shift cars.  \n   → Scratch Lionel Jackson (automatic) from the list.  \n\n5. What about the decal?  \n   • Bill was certain there was NOTHING on the rear window.  \n   → That eliminates Amy Golden, whose Porsche carries a faded decal.  \n\n6. Physical ability to drive a clutch car.  \n   • Jeremy Steele has his left foot in a cast, impossible for operating the clutch on a manual 911.  \n   → He could not have driven the getaway car, so strike him off as well.  \n\n7. We are left with Frankie Cole and Susan Barker.  \n   • Frankie has NO alibi – he admits he was alone in a distant hangar.  \n   • Susan claims she was at work for Dr Pitts “down the road.” A single phone call (standard detective procedure, omitted from the narrative’s detail but obviously easy for Caldwell to make while he was collecting the owners’ phone numbers) would confirm that she actually was on duty at 9:47 a.m.  \n   • Frankie’s Porsche is “shiny and clean,” i.e., no decal, manual stick, and he had both feet in full working order.  \n   • Susan is on the heavier side but otherwise medium build; Mrs Parker could not state the robber’s sex.  \n\n8. With the automatic eliminated, the decal eliminated and the clutch-foot problem eliminated, the ONLY owner whose Porsche matches every detail and who has no supporting alibi is FRANKIE COLE.  \n\nThat is why, the moment Bill confirmed the absence of any back-up-light flash (proving it was not the automatic), Caldwell knew it had to be Frankie and asked for a pair of handcuffs. “Sometimes you get lucky.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFrankie Cole, Amy Golden, Susan Barker, Jeremy Steele, Lionel Jackson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nFrankie Cole\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly Monday, Frankie Cole drove his burgundy 1976 Porsche 911 to Macon Central Savings.  \nBecause he intended to get away quickly he backed the car into the empty slot behind the bank president’s vehicle before the robbery, so when the moment came he could roar straight out without touching reverse.  \nAt 9:47 a.m. he entered the bank wearing a hood and gloves, handed Mrs Parker the note and the sack, silently pointed his pistol, collected the cash and hurried back outside.  \nBill Thomas had started toward the lobby only seconds before; he reached the parking lot just as Frankie started the Porsche. Because the car was backed in, Frankie only had to clutch, engage 1st gear and drive straight ahead—no reverse lights. Bill had a clear rear view, noticed no decal, and saw enough of the car’s design to know it was a ’76 911.  \nFrankie sped to the airport, hid the money in his isolated hangar, wiped the car down and answered Caldwell’s phone call, arriving at the bank first—thinking his “I was alone in the hangar” story would sound normal.  \nBut the mechanical facts of the getaway ruled out every other owner, and the lack of any alibi sealed his fate.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Amy Golden – her Porsche carries a faded rear-window decal that Bill would definitely have seen.  \n• Jeremy Steele – with his left foot in a cast he could not operate the clutch on a manual-shift 911.  \n• Lionel Jackson – his is the *only* automatic 911; an automatic would have flashed its reverse lights while the selector passed through “R,” directly contradicting Bill’s observation.  \n• Susan Barker – her employer, Dr Pitts, could corroborate that she was at work at 9:47 a.m., and nothing in Bill’s description contradicts her (but everything points uniquely to Frankie once the decal, the cast, and the automatic are factored out).\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "When Bill asked who it was, Martin explained the case. “Although she had no alibi, I was able to narrow the choice by eliminating Amy Golden because of the decal in the window. You said there was nothing on the rear window. As for Susan Barker, she was at work when the robbery occurred, so she could not have done it. Jeremy has a cast on his foot. He not only could not drive, but the thief ran out of the bank. With a broken foot, he would not be running. I was still puzzled until I remembered something from my own experience. When shifting an automatic transmission into drive, the shifter slides past the reverse gear and causes the back up lights to flicker for an instant. Since you were sure that this didn't happen, this meant that the car that was used in the robbery was a manual transmission. Lionel’s car is an automatic so he was eliminated. That left only Frankie Cole who had to be the thief.”",

In her sixty's and spry as ever, Mrs. Parker seemed relieved to see the detective and began telling what happened. \"I was alone up front behind the tellers counter when the thief suddenly burst in without saying a word and handed me a note, saying to put all of the money in the bag that he was carrying.\" Martin lifted his head and asked, \"did you say he?” Mrs. Parker smiled and answered, \"well, I'm not sure of course, because the thief didn't say a word and was wearing a hood and gloves that concealed his features. He just handed me the note and brandished a pistol at me, so I stuffed all of the money in the bag and then the robber ran out the door.” Martin also discovered that the security video wasn't operating and was being replaced by a newer system. Having gleaned everything of importance from Mrs. Parker, including the description of medium height and weight, a description that would fit a lot of people, he went looking for the security guard, a guy named Bill Thomas. Bill, who used to work at police headquarters but retired and now worked part time at the bank, was coming out of the bank president’s office and saw that Martin had arrived. \"Hey Bill, let me guess, you were in the john and didn't see anything, right?” Martin and Bill were old friends and had shared many cases together so they knew each other well. \"Aw, come on Martin, you know my routine so well that you already knew that. But I did get out in time to see the car speeding away and it was a 1976 Porsche 911, burgundy in color. I've never seen one that color before but that's what it was. My nephew has a 911 and I couldn't be mistaken.” Martin told Bill that he would talk to him later and went to use the phone. When Martin called the Department of Motor vehicles, he found out that there were only five 911's in the whole country that matched that description. All of them sold in Macon at the local dealership. When someone made a special order for the burgundy color a mistake was made and five were shipped and sold in 1976. The only difference in them was that one had an automatic transmissions and the others all had manual shifters which entailed using a clutch. Bill hadn't noticed the difference so Martin got the phone numbers of the owners and asked them to come down to the bank. He hoped that one of them wouldn't show up and maybe narrow the field, but they all agreed to come. Frankie Cole was the first to arrive because he worked at the nearby airport and just had a short commute. He was working in one of the back hangars as a mechanic but he was working alone and didn't have an alibi. His car was shiny and clean with a manual shifter and purred like a kitten when running. He seemed like an honest guy, but in this business you never knew. He was the right size but so far that didn't mean anything Amy Golden, a housewife and mother pulled in beside Frankie and shut off her motor. Her car also had a manual shifter and was identical except for a small faded decal in the rear window. She too seemed very pleasant. Again, the size matched. Although they were not with her at the time of the robbery, her aunt and uncle would vouch for her character she said and gave Martin their phone number. The third to arrive was Susan Barker who worked for Dr. Pitts down the road. She was indignant about having to leave her job to be interviewed and swore that she was working when the bank was robbed. She was a little larger in build than the other two but not much. Again, she had an identical car. Like the first two cars, the shifter had the H pattern on it with the numbers one through four and a reverse to the side. Jeremy Steele, a pimpled-faced young man was angry to have to come over for questioning. His girlfriend, a plump young blond named Tammy, drove him to the bank. When asked why Tammy drove him in, Jeremy pointed to the signature-covered cast on his left foot and said that he could not work the clutch with his broken foot. Unfortunately, Tammy was not able to vouch for his whereabouts at the time of the robbery. The last suspect to arrive was a young black college student named Lionel Jackson, who was on the way to school and didn't have a solid alibi either. His car was in perfect shape like the others. Very polite and, you guessed it, medium build and weight. Martin sat in the car and looked at the familiar PRNDL that was short for park, reverse, neutral, drive and low gears. Nothing was ever easy it seemed in these cases. Shaking his head, Martin walked back over to Bill and asked him what view he had of the car while it was racing away. \" I was running up behind it when the thief cranked up and sped off. But I'm sure that it didn't have anything on the rear window.” Martin trusted Bill's eyewitness account because of Bill's police training. \" Martin looked at the empty parking space behind the bank president's car and asked, \"did the thief put the car in reverse before leaving the parking space, or just go straight ahead?\" Bill frowned and thought for a moment before answering, \"nope, not a flicker of the back up lights, so no, no reverse.” After thinking about all of the testimonies of the suspects he said to Bill. \"Do you still have your old set of rusty handcuffs, I left mine at the station?” Bill smiled and said, \" So you know who did it huh?” Martin said. \"Sometimes you get lucky.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Amy Golden; (b) Frankie Cole; (c) Jeremy Steele; (d) Lionel Jacobs; (e) Susan Barker",
      "answer": "(b) Frankie Cole",
      "outcome": "When Bill asked who it was, Martin explained the case. “Although she had no alibi, I was able to narrow the choice by eliminating Amy Golden because of the decal in the window. You said there was nothing on the rear window. As for Susan Barker, she was at work when the robbery occurred, so she could not have done it. Jeremy has a cast on his foot. He not only could not drive, but the thief ran out of the bank. With a broken foot, he would not be running. I was still puzzled until I remembered something from my own experience. When shifting an automatic transmission into drive, the shifter slides past the reverse gear and causes the back up lights to flicker for an instant. Since you were sure that this didn't happen, this meant that the car that was used in the robbery was a manual transmission. Lionel’s car is an automatic so he was eliminated. That left only Frankie Cole who had to be the thief.”"
