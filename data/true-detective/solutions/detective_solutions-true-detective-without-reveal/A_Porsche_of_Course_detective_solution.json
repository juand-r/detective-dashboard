    "full_text": "When Martin Caldwell got to his office on Monday morning, he felt as if he had just left minutes ago. Being a city detective called for long and sometimes boring investigations that often led nowhere. He had only had four hours of sleep and when he looked in the mirror in the men's room, he could tell it. With the bags under his eyes along with the weight he had gained he looked like a basset hound. What hair he had left was sprinkled with gray and his blue eyes were so red that they looked like a Florida road map. Along with his rumpled suit he had spilled coffee and mustard on his white shirt, but he couldn't seem to make himself care. \"Maybe nothing will happen today and I can steal a short nap,” he thought. He had closed the door and settled back in his chair with his feet on the desk when the phone began ringing. He let it trill on a few times hoping it would stop, but knowing it wouldn't. \"Detective Caldwell, I'm glad you finally made it to work this morning, and just in time too, there's been a bank robbery\" the deep voice said. Martin recognized the voice of Chief Jennings and started to protest, but having been on this earth for fifty-one years and knowing the chief, said only, \"where and when?” The chief told him that Macon Central Savings had been robbed only thirty minutes ago, about 9:47 a.m. He was to go and interview the witnesses and talk to the security guard about the heist. \"Maybe this will be quick and I can go home,” he thought. The bank was fairly new, having been built only two years ago in 1974 and he knew it well because he had a small retirement account there. Thus he was acquainted with the personnel and the bank president, Mr. Riley. When he entered, Mrs. Parker was sitting in one of the chairs along the wall and was being consoled by a pretty young Oriental girl that Martin recognized as a recently hired teller. In her sixty's and spry as ever, Mrs. Parker seemed relieved to see the detective and began telling what happened. \"I was alone up front behind the tellers counter when the thief suddenly burst in without saying a word and handed me a note, saying to put all of the money in the bag that he was carrying.\" Martin lifted his head and asked, \"did you say he?” Mrs. Parker smiled and answered, \"well, I'm not sure of course, because the thief didn't say a word and was wearing a hood and gloves that concealed his features. He just handed me the note and brandished a pistol at me, so I stuffed all of the money in the bag and then the robber ran out the door.” Martin also discovered that the security video wasn't operating and was being replaced by a newer system. Having gleaned everything of importance from Mrs. Parker, including the description of medium height and weight, a description that would fit a lot of people, he went looking for the security guard, a guy named Bill Thomas. Bill, who used to work at police headquarters but retired and now worked part time at the bank, was coming out of the bank president’s office and saw that Martin had arrived. \"Hey Bill, let me guess, you were in the john and didn't see anything, right?” Martin and Bill were old friends and had shared many cases together so they knew each other well. \"Aw, come on Martin, you know my routine so well that you already knew that. But I did get out in time to see the car speeding away and it was a 1976 Porsche 911, burgundy in color. I've never seen one that color before but that's what it was. My nephew has a 911 and I couldn't be mistaken.” Martin told Bill that he would talk to him later and went to use the phone. When Martin called the Department of Motor vehicles, he found out that there were only five 911's in the whole country that matched that description. All of them sold in Macon at the local dealership. When someone made a special order for the burgundy color a mistake was made and five were shipped and sold in 1976. The only difference in them was that one had an automatic transmissions and the others all had manual shifters which entailed using a clutch. Bill hadn't noticed the difference so Martin got the phone numbers of the owners and asked them to come down to the bank. He hoped that one of them wouldn't show up and maybe narrow the field, but they all agreed to come. Frankie Cole was the first to arrive because he worked at the nearby airport and just had a short commute. He was working in one of the back hangars as a mechanic but he was working alone and didn't have an alibi. His car was shiny and clean with a manual shifter and purred like a kitten when running. He seemed like an honest guy, but in this business you never knew. He was the right size but so far that didn't mean anything Amy Golden, a housewife and mother pulled in beside Frankie and shut off her motor. Her car also had a manual shifter and was identical except for a small faded decal in the rear window. She too seemed very pleasant. Again, the size matched. Although they were not with her at the time of the robbery, her aunt and uncle would vouch for her character she said and gave Martin their phone number. The third to arrive was Susan Barker who worked for Dr. Pitts down the road. She was indignant about having to leave her job to be interviewed and swore that she was working when the bank was robbed. She was a little larger in build than the other two but not much. Again, she had an identical car. Like the first two cars, the shifter had the H pattern on it with the numbers one through four and a reverse to the side. Jeremy Steele, a pimpled-faced young man was angry to have to come over for questioning. His girlfriend, a plump young blond named Tammy, drove him to the bank. When asked why Tammy drove him in, Jeremy pointed to the signature-covered cast on his left foot and said that he could not work the clutch with his broken foot. Unfortunately, Tammy was not able to vouch for his whereabouts at the time of the robbery. The last suspect to arrive was a young black college student named Lionel Jackson, who was on the way to school and didn't have a solid alibi either. His car was in perfect shape like the others. Very polite and, you guessed it, medium build and weight. Martin sat in the car and looked at the familiar PRNDL that was short for park, reverse, neutral, drive and low gears. Nothing was ever easy it seemed in these cases. Shaking his head, Martin walked back over to Bill and asked him what view he had of the car while it was racing away. \" I was running up behind it when the thief cranked up and sped off. But I'm sure that it didn't have anything on the rear window.” Martin trusted Bill's eyewitness account because of Bill's police training. \" Martin looked at the empty parking space behind the bank president's car and asked, \"did the thief put the car in reverse before leaving the parking space, or just go straight ahead?\" Bill frowned and thought for a moment before answering, \"nope, not a flicker of the back up lights, so no, no reverse.” After thinking about all of the testimonies of the suspects he said to Bill. \"Do you still have your old set of rusty handcuffs, I left mine at the station?” Bill smiled and said, \" So you know who did it huh?” Martin said. \"Sometimes you get lucky.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First I listed what is known about the getaway car.  \n   • It was a 1976 burgundy Porsche 911.  \n   • Four of the five such cars in the country are stick-shift; exactly one is an automatic (and an automatic selector shows the positions P-R-N-D-L, “PRNDL”).  \n   • The security guard was running directly behind the Porsche when it pulled away. He states positively that he never saw the reverse (back-up) lights come on and that there was “nothing on the rear window.”\n\n2. Automatic vs. manual  \n   • With every American-made automatic of that era the lever must be moved from Park down through Reverse to reach Drive. Even if the driver backs into the space first, the reverse lights will flash for the split-second the lever touches “R.”  \n   • In a manually-shifted car the reverse lights illuminate only when the gear lever is actually placed in the reverse gate. A driver can start the engine in neutral, select first gear and drive straight off without the reverse lights ever coming on.  \n   • Because the guard saw no flicker of back-up lights, the robber had to be driving one of the four manual-transmission 911s. Lionel Jackson’s Porsche – the only automatic (the one Detective Caldwell looked at with its familiar “PRNDL”) – is therefore ruled out.\n\n3. Decal on the back window  \n   • The guard insists there was “nothing on the rear window.”  \n   • Amy Golden’s 911 carries a small, faded decal on that window. Even a small sticker would have been visible to a trained ex-policeman who was only a few yards behind the car. Amy is therefore excluded.\n\n4. Ability to drive a stick shift  \n   • Jeremy Steele’s left foot is in a plaster cast. Operating a clutch requires the left foot; Jeremy could not have driven a manual 911 away at speed. (His girlfriend had to drive him to the bank.) Jeremy is out.\n\n5. Remaining manual-transmission owners  \n   • Frankie Cole – airport mechanic, working alone, no witnesses, no decal, medium build.  \n   • Susan Barker – receptionist for Dr. Pitts, says she was at work, presumably can be verified, slightly larger build than the description; no decal.\n\n6. Opportunity / alibi  \n   • Susan’s claim can be confirmed or disproved quickly by telephoning the doctor’s office; a receptionist’s absence in the middle of a Monday morning would be noticed. A detective as experienced as Caldwell would certainly have done that before asking for handcuffs.  \n   • Frankie was working alone in a hangar; no one can account for his whereabouts at 9:47 a.m. The airport is only a few minutes from the bank – plenty of time to slip away, commit the robbery and be back at work.\n\n7. Conclusion  \n   Eliminating everyone else leaves only Frankie Cole. With motive unknown but with no alibi, the correct transmission type, no decal and the right physical build, he is the only possible culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFrankie Cole, Amy Golden, Susan Barker, Jeremy Steele, Lionel Jackson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nFrankie Cole\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly Monday morning Frankie Cole left the hangar at the nearby airport, drove his burgundy stick-shift 1976 Porsche 911 – which has no decal on the rear window – to Macon Central Savings and backed into an empty slot behind the bank president’s car. Wearing gloves and a hood, he entered the bank at 9:47 a.m., silently handed Mrs Parker a note and showed a pistol. She filled his bag with cash. Frankie ran back to his car, jumped in, started the engine (in neutral), selected first gear and sped straight forward out of the space. Because the car was a manual, his reverse lights never lit, a fact noted by guard Bill Thomas. Frankie was out of the area and back at the airport hangar before anyone missed him. When the police traced the five special-order Porsches, he had to present himself – but he was the only owner who fit every single detail of the eyewitness evidence, so Detective Caldwell asked for the handcuffs.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Lionel Jackson – owns the only automatic-transmission 911; the reverse lights would have flashed when he shifted from Park to Drive, contradicting the guard’s observation.  \n• Amy Golden – her 911 carries a decal on the rear window, which the guard did not see.  \n• Jeremy Steele – his left foot is in a cast; he could not have operated the clutch on a manual 911.  \n• Susan Barker – her employer can account for her whereabouts during the robbery; moreover Detective Caldwell would not have acted without checking that alibi.  \nOnce those four are excluded, only Frankie Cole remains, making him the robber.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "When Bill asked who it was, Martin explained the case. “Although she had no alibi, I was able to narrow the choice by eliminating Amy Golden because of the decal in the window. You said there was nothing on the rear window. As for Susan Barker, she was at work when the robbery occurred, so she could not have done it. Jeremy has a cast on his foot. He not only could not drive, but the thief ran out of the bank. With a broken foot, he would not be running. I was still puzzled until I remembered something from my own experience. When shifting an automatic transmission into drive, the shifter slides past the reverse gear and causes the back up lights to flicker for an instant. Since you were sure that this didn't happen, this meant that the car that was used in the robbery was a manual transmission. Lionel’s car is an automatic so he was eliminated. That left only Frankie Cole who had to be the thief.”",

But I did get out in time to see the car speeding away and it was a 1976 Porsche 911, burgundy in color. I've never seen one that color before but that's what it was. My nephew has a 911 and I couldn't be mistaken.” Martin told Bill that he would talk to him later and went to use the phone. When Martin called the Department of Motor vehicles, he found out that there were only five 911's in the whole country that matched that description. All of them sold in Macon at the local dealership. When someone made a special order for the burgundy color a mistake was made and five were shipped and sold in 1976. The only difference in them was that one had an automatic transmissions and the others all had manual shifters which entailed using a clutch. Bill hadn't noticed the difference so Martin got the phone numbers of the owners and asked them to come down to the bank. He hoped that one of them wouldn't show up and maybe narrow the field, but they all agreed to come. Frankie Cole was the first to arrive because he worked at the nearby airport and just had a short commute. He was working in one of the back hangars as a mechanic but he was working alone and didn't have an alibi. His car was shiny and clean with a manual shifter and purred like a kitten when running. He seemed like an honest guy, but in this business you never knew. He was the right size but so far that didn't mean anything Amy Golden, a housewife and mother pulled in beside Frankie and shut off her motor. Her car also had a manual shifter and was identical except for a small faded decal in the rear window. She too seemed very pleasant. Again, the size matched. Although they were not with her at the time of the robbery, her aunt and uncle would vouch for her character she said and gave Martin their phone number. The third to arrive was Susan Barker who worked for Dr. Pitts down the road. She was indignant about having to leave her job to be interviewed and swore that she was working when the bank was robbed. She was a little larger in build than the other two but not much. Again, she had an identical car. Like the first two cars, the shifter had the H pattern on it with the numbers one through four and a reverse to the side. Jeremy Steele, a pimpled-faced young man was angry to have to come over for questioning. His girlfriend, a plump young blond named Tammy, drove him to the bank. When asked why Tammy drove him in, Jeremy pointed to the signature-covered cast on his left foot and said that he could not work the clutch with his broken foot. Unfortunately, Tammy was not able to vouch for his whereabouts at the time of the robbery. The last suspect to arrive was a young black college student named Lionel Jackson, who was on the way to school and didn't have a solid alibi either. His car was in perfect shape like the others. Very polite and, you guessed it, medium build and weight. Martin sat in the car and looked at the familiar PRNDL that was short for park, reverse, neutral, drive and low gears. Nothing was ever easy it seemed in these cases. Shaking his head, Martin walked back over to Bill and asked him what view he had of the car while it was racing away. \" I was running up behind it when the thief cranked up and sped off. But I'm sure that it didn't have anything on the rear window.” Martin trusted Bill's eyewitness account because of Bill's police training. \" Martin looked at the empty parking space behind the bank president's car and asked, \"did the thief put the car in reverse before leaving the parking space, or just go straight ahead?\" Bill frowned and thought for a moment before answering, \"nope, not a flicker of the back up lights, so no, no reverse.” After thinking about all of the testimonies of the suspects he said to Bill. \"Do you still have your old set of rusty handcuffs, I left mine at the station?” Bill smiled and said, \" So you know who did it huh?” Martin said. \"Sometimes you get lucky.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Amy Golden; (b) Frankie Cole; (c) Jeremy Steele; (d) Lionel Jacobs; (e) Susan Barker",
      "answer": "(b) Frankie Cole",
      "outcome": "When Bill asked who it was, Martin explained the case. “Although she had no alibi, I was able to narrow the choice by eliminating Amy Golden because of the decal in the window. You said there was nothing on the rear window. As for Susan Barker, she was at work when the robbery occurred, so she could not have done it. Jeremy has a cast on his foot. He not only could not drive, but the thief ran out of the bank. With a broken foot, he would not be running. I was still puzzled until I remembered something from my own experience. When shifting an automatic transmission into drive, the shifter slides past the reverse gear and causes the back up lights to flicker for an instant. Since you were sure that this didn't happen, this meant that the car that was used in the robbery was a manual transmission. Lionel’s car is an automatic so he was eliminated. That left only Frankie Cole who had to be the thief.”"
