    "full_text": "I get pretty tired of playing second fiddle to Sam Spade in our own detective firm. Sure, the clients come in, when they do, and play up to him. That’s because I’m usually out of the office, trying to drum up business, anyway. You know, hanging around the precinct, listening to what the cops and reporters have to say, that sort of thing. Maybe that’s why I never got to tell my story, the case I was working on when my partner Sam stumbled onto this Maltese Falcon business, and that cast of movie characters: Joel Cairo, Kasper Gutman, Wilmer Cook, and, oh yes, Brigid O’Shaughnessy. Sam had sent me out with never a second glance, chasing this fellow Floyd Thursby, who was after O’Shaughnessy—at least that’s what Brigid had told us. I never made it back, as you probably know, although I have seen the movie, watching it over your shoulder from time to time. But what you didn’t know is that the case I was working on was every bit as interesting as the one Sam Spade is best known for, his Black Bird caper. Also, I’ve got to admit, my wife Iva sounded a little different, after I started this case and called home to let her know I’d be late for supper. Would you believe it, I always thought she had something of a crush on Sam. Well, solving this case would fix that, and bring in some good money as well. I was in our office checking out the latest Police Gazette when Sandra O’Malley called. As usual our secretary, Effie Perrine, monitored the call. O’Malley sounded nervous and upset, so I talked her down a few registers until she could tell me something of her story. She agreed to meet me at the Donovan Hotel bar for a drink and the rest of her story. It sounded like serious money, and Effie gave me the old “thumbs up!” as I grabbed my fedora and left the office. Sandra O’Malley was an old fashioned girl. By that, I mean she was on her second Old Fashioned when I joined her. “You’ve got to help me, Mr. Archer,” she began. “I only went after those stock certificates because Quinton Jesselton, my boss, told me to. They were bearer certificates, meaning anybody who possessed them could cash them, and they were worth thousands of dollars.” So, I gathered, would be the fee for finding them. “Ok. Calm down, Miss O’Malley, and tell me exactly what happened.” She took another sip and tried to get her story right. “Mr. Jesselton has a collecting business. People with debts to collect refer them to him. He collects them, for a large percentage. Nothing too illegal, you understand—the collecting part, I mean. But these are debts that people would not exactly like to be made public in the first place.” I understood perfectly well. They were illegal gambling debts, or possibly from some other shady business. When the debtor didn’t pay up, it was nothing that the Better Business Bureau could help with. “What were you supposed to do, and what went wrong?” “I was supposed to get the stock certificates from Arnold Grossmecker’s office. It was yesterday, a Sunday afternoon, and nobody was there. It was supposed to be an easy job, really. There was just one security man on duty in the lobby, and he wasn’t always behind the desk, if you know what I mean. It wasn’t hard to sneak past his station when he went to the men’s room. The elevator wasn’t key operated, and I got off at the fifth floor. Grossmecker’s office was down the hall, and the place was empty. Our office skeleton key worked perfectly; I was able to get inside quickly. Mr. Jesselton had been to that office once before. He said he always gave those people one chance to do things right, without complications. “Jesselton paid attention as he was shown into the inner office by Grossmecker’s secretary, Brigid Jellicoe, and saw that Grossmecker had taken the key to the drawer from under a small stone statue on his desk. The point, Jesselton had told me, was that Grossmecker wanted to show him the stock certificates, to show that he was good for the debt. All he needed was a little more time for a deal he was working on to pay off big time. But not a dime now, he had said. Mr. Jesselton said he had a good look at the certificates, which seemed genuine. Their face value was one thousand dollars each, and there were a dozen of them, enough to just cover Grossmecker’s debt in full. “But Mr. Jesselton didn’t trust Grossmecker and his big time deal. He sent me to go get the stock certificates to avoid any more stalling. So yesterday, like I said, I went into the office, lifted the stone statue, and unlocked the desk drawer. The certificates were there all right. I looked around the office and found a stack of large manila envelopes, and put the stock certificates inside one of them. So far, so good. Then all blazes broke loose! “The door behind me opened, and a large man entered the room. ‘What are you doing in my office?’ He yelled to a woman who entered with him, ‘Brigid, tie up her hands!’ I wasn’t about to give him any argument, after one look at the Smith & Wesson he was wagging in my direction. I must have dropped the manila envelope I was carrying. It all happened so fast! Then the lights went out. It was late afternoon, daylight fading, but the shades were drawn. It was harder to see than if the lights had never been on. ‘Hands up!’ another voice said, and I was relieved to see that it was my boss, Mr. Jesselton. What he was doing there, I don’t know. But I’ve never been gladder to see anyone in my life! “Anyway, we tore out of that office and jumped into Mr. Jesselton’s waiting car. His driver had kept the motor running. We set some sort of record getting back to the office. Then I handed the manila envelope to Jesselton. His face went sour. ‘Is this some kind of a joke? If so, I don’t see the humor!’ I followed his look, and saw that the large manila envelope I had just handed him was empty! He gave me just a day to cough up the missing certificates. Of course I tried going back to Grossmecker, pleading my case, but he swears up and down that I took ’em, and that Mr. Jesselton must be trying to pull a fast one on me. That’s why I called you, Mr. Archer. You’ve got to find out what happened! Mr. Jesselton is waiting for us at the office.” We went back to Jesselton’s office, and I called Grossmecker from the phone there. I told him that I had been retained to solve the case, and that I’d be arriving at his office shortly with Jesselton and the young Sandra. When we arrived I said, “Show me exactly what happened.” I looked around. “Don’t leave anything out. Say exactly what you said yesterday, when the stock certificates went missing. I want an exact picture of what happened.” I sat in the office and watched the rerun. Sandra came into the office, flipped on the wall light switch, paused, then looked under the stone statue on the desk, and found the desk key. She opened the desk, and found ... nothing. “Don't worry,” I said. “Just take it from there.” I handed her my newspaper. She looked around the office, saw the stack of large manila envelopes on a side table near the entrance, and opened the top envelope, shoveling my newspaper into it. “What are you doing in my office?” yelled Arnold Grossmecker as he charged through the door. He had a coat in one hand and a Smith & Wesson in the other. The woman, Brigid Jellicoe, followed him in. “Brigid, tie up her hands!” Grossmecker yelled. I could see Brigid Jellicoe ducking back into her outer office. She dropped her coat, produced some string from her desk, entered Grossmecker’s office once again, and quickly tied Brigid’s hands behind her back. Nobody went near the large manila envelope,which Sandra had dropped on the floor. Then the light switch was flipped off by someone in the doorway. That same someone crashed into the room, hat and overcoat still on, a revolver in his right hand. “Hands up!” said Quentin Jesselton. He advanced into the room, walked back and forth, and asked Sandra if she was all right. She murmured yes. After a moment, the light switch was flipped back on by Jesselton. He untied Sandra’s hands, and she picked up the manila envelope from the floor. Then she and Jesselton slowly backed out of the room. I felt like a film director shooting a scene. “Was this how it happened? Would anyone change anything?” Everyone agreed that their little play had been accurate. Then I took out my own revolver. “Hand me your weapons,” I said. “And I’ll tell you who stole the stock certificates.” They did, and I did.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWho BENEFITS from the certificates disappearing?\n   – Only Quinton Jesselton.  \n   If the bearer certificates never reach his office he can pretend they are still missing, cash them himself and keep both the money and the original debt claim against Grossmecker.  \n   – Grossmecker would merely get back what was already his; Sandra O’Malley is an employee with no way to cash them without being caught; Brigid Jellicoe has no known interest; the night–watchman and chauffeur are irrelevant.\n\n2.\tWhen could they have been taken?\n   The certificates were inside the manila envelope for only one brief interval – while the room was in total darkness after the light-switch was flipped.  \n   Before the lights went out Sandra still had them; after the lights came on again the envelope was empty.  \n   Therefore whoever was free to move in the dark, and who knew exactly what he wanted, had to have removed them in those few seconds.\n\n3.\tWhere was every person during the darkness?\n   • Sandra – trussed up, hands behind her back. She could not open the envelope.  \n   • Arnold Grossmecker – “Hands up!”, gun dropped, standing rigid in front of Jesselton’s revolver.  \n   • Brigid Jellicoe – likewise, ordered to raise her hands.  \n   • Quinton Jesselton – the only one who kept a hand free (his left hand; his right held the gun) and who deliberately caused and ended the darkness by the switch at the door. He walked “back and forth” between the others – exactly where the envelope lay on the floor.\n\n4.\tThe re-enactment clinches it.\n   Archer replaced the certificates with a folded newspaper and had everyone repeat their movements.  \n   This time the room was fully lit; nobody dared stoop while they were watched – and the newspaper was still inside the envelope at the end.  \n   So in the original scene someone had bent down in the darkness and removed the contents.  \n   The only person who behaved differently the first time was Jesselton – he had used the darkness he himself created.\n\n5.\tLogical deduction\n   Motive + sole opportunity + re-enactment difference = Jesselton is the thief.  No assistance was needed; he could hide the thin packet of certificates in his coat pocket in a single motion.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSandra O’Malley, Quinton (Quentin) Jesselton, Arnold Grossmecker, Brigid Jellicoe\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nQuinton (Quentin) Jesselton\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Jesselton, wanting to keep the bearer stock certificates for himself, sent his secretary Sandra to steal them, planning to double-cross both her and Grossmecker.  \n• He followed her to Grossmecker’s office with his chauffeur waiting outside.  \n• Sandra entered, found the certificates, slipped them into a large manila envelope and, when surprised by Grossmecker and Brigid, dropped the envelope on the floor.  \n• Jesselton, waiting in the corridor, switched off the lights, burst in with his revolver and ordered, “Hands up!”  \n• In the pitch dark he stooped, slid the twelve certificates out of the open envelope with his free hand, stuffed them into his coat pocket, straightened up and switched the lights on again.  \n• He untied Sandra, allowed her to retrieve the now-empty envelope and escorted her to the waiting car, pretending to be her rescuer.  \n• Back at his office he feigned anger when he “discovered” the envelope was empty, giving Sandra 24 hours to “produce” the certificates – thereby removing suspicion from himself while keeping the negotiable papers.  \n• During the re-enactment, under Archer’s eyes and in full light, Jesselton had no chance to repeat the theft; Archer’s newspaper remained in the envelope, proving the removal must have happened in the original darkness – and only Jesselton could have done it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSandra O’Malley – Her hands were tied behind her back during the blackout; she could not touch the envelope. She also had no motive to make the certificates disappear—her job depended on handing them to Jesselton.\n\nArnold Grossmecker – He owed the debt; keeping the certificates would not benefit him (they were already his property). Moreover he was facing Jesselton’s gun with his hands up in the dark and could not bend and fumble on the floor.\n\nBrigid Jellicoe – Same position as her employer, with her hands raised. No financial gain is shown, and the re-enactment proved she never neared the envelope.\n\nNo one else (the security guard, the chauffeur) was inside the office when the lights were out, so they had no opportunity.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

He untied Sandra’s hands, and she picked up the manila envelope from the floor. Then she and Jesselton slowly backed out of the room. I felt like a film director shooting a scene. “Was this how it happened? Would anyone change anything?” Everyone agreed that their little play had been accurate. Then I took out my own revolver. “Hand me your weapons,” I said. “And I’ll tell you who stole the stock certificates.” They did, and I did.",

      "mystery_text": "I get pretty tired of playing second fiddle to Sam Spade in our own detective firm. Sure, the clients come in, when they do, and play up to him. That’s because I’m usually out of the office, trying to drum up business, anyway. You know, hanging around the precinct, listening to what the cops and reporters have to say, that sort of thing. Maybe that’s why I never got to tell my story, the case I was working on when my partner Sam stumbled onto this Maltese Falcon business, and that cast of movie characters: Joel Cairo, Kasper Gutman, Wilmer Cook, and, oh yes, Brigid O’Shaughnessy. Sam had sent me out with never a second glance, chasing this fellow Floyd Thursby, who was after O’Shaughnessy—at least that’s what Brigid had told us. I never made it back, as you probably know, although I have seen the movie, watching it over your shoulder from time to time. But what you didn’t know is that the case I was working on was every bit as interesting as the one Sam Spade is best known for, his Black Bird caper. Also, I’ve got to admit, my wife Iva sounded a little different, after I started this case and called home to let her know I’d be late for supper. Would you believe it, I always thought she had something of a crush on Sam. Well, solving this case would fix that, and bring in some good money as well. I was in our office checking out the latest Police Gazette when Sandra O’Malley called. As usual our secretary, Effie Perrine, monitored the call. O’Malley sounded nervous and upset, so I talked her down a few registers until she could tell me something of her story. She agreed to meet me at the Donovan Hotel bar for a drink and the rest of her story. It sounded like serious money, and Effie gave me the old “thumbs up!” as I grabbed my fedora and left the office. Sandra O’Malley was an old fashioned girl. By that, I mean she was on her second Old Fashioned when I joined her. “You’ve got to help me, Mr. Archer,” she began. “I only went after those stock certificates because Quinton Jesselton, my boss, told me to. They were bearer certificates, meaning anybody who possessed them could cash them, and they were worth thousands of dollars.” So, I gathered, would be the fee for finding them. “Ok. Calm down, Miss O’Malley, and tell me exactly what happened.” She took another sip and tried to get her story right. “Mr. Jesselton has a collecting business. People with debts to collect refer them to him. He collects them, for a large percentage. Nothing too illegal, you understand—the collecting part, I mean. But these are debts that people would not exactly like to be made public in the first place.” I understood perfectly well. They were illegal gambling debts, or possibly from some other shady business. When the debtor didn’t pay up, it was nothing that the Better Business Bureau could help with. “What were you supposed to do, and what went wrong?” “I was supposed to get the stock certificates from Arnold Grossmecker’s office. It was yesterday, a Sunday afternoon, and nobody was there. It was supposed to be an easy job, really. There was just one security man on duty in the lobby, and he wasn’t always behind the desk, if you know what I mean. It wasn’t hard to sneak past his station when he went to the men’s room. The elevator wasn’t key operated, and I got off at the fifth floor. Grossmecker’s office was down the hall, and the place was empty. Our office skeleton key worked perfectly; I was able to get inside quickly. Mr. Jesselton had been to that office once before. He said he always gave those people one chance to do things right, without complications. “Jesselton paid attention as he was shown into the inner office by Grossmecker’s secretary, Brigid Jellicoe, and saw that Grossmecker had taken the key to the drawer from under a small stone statue on his desk. The point, Jesselton had told me, was that Grossmecker wanted to show him the stock certificates, to show that he was good for the debt. All he needed was a little more time for a deal he was working on to pay off big time. But not a dime now, he had said. Mr. Jesselton said he had a good look at the certificates, which seemed genuine. Their face value was one thousand dollars each, and there were a dozen of them, enough to just cover Grossmecker’s debt in full. “But Mr. Jesselton didn’t trust Grossmecker and his big time deal. He sent me to go get the stock certificates to avoid any more stalling. So yesterday, like I said, I went into the office, lifted the stone statue, and unlocked the desk drawer. The certificates were there all right. I looked around the office and found a stack of large manila envelopes, and put the stock certificates inside one of them. So far, so good. Then all blazes broke loose! “The door behind me opened, and a large man entered the room. ‘What are you doing in my office?’ He yelled to a woman who entered with him, ‘Brigid, tie up her hands!’ I wasn’t about to give him any argument, after one look at the Smith & Wesson he was wagging in my direction. I must have dropped the manila envelope I was carrying. It all happened so fast! Then the lights went out. It was late afternoon, daylight fading, but the shades were drawn. It was harder to see than if the lights had never been on. ‘Hands up!’ another voice said, and I was relieved to see that it was my boss, Mr. Jesselton. What he was doing there, I don’t know. But I’ve never been gladder to see anyone in my life! “Anyway, we tore out of that office and jumped into Mr. Jesselton’s waiting car. His driver had kept the motor running. We set some sort of record getting back to the office. Then I handed the manila envelope to Jesselton. His face went sour. ‘Is this some kind of a joke? If so, I don’t see the humor!’ I followed his look, and saw that the large manila envelope I had just handed him was empty! He gave me just a day to cough up the missing certificates. Of course I tried going back to Grossmecker, pleading my case, but he swears up and down that I took ’em, and that Mr. Jesselton must be trying to pull a fast one on me. That’s why I called you, Mr. Archer. You’ve got to find out what happened! Mr. Jesselton is waiting for us at the office.” We went back to Jesselton’s office, and I called Grossmecker from the phone there. I told him that I had been retained to solve the case, and that I’d be arriving at his office shortly with Jesselton and the young Sandra. When we arrived I said, “Show me exactly what happened.” I looked around. “Don’t leave anything out. Say exactly what you said yesterday, when the stock certificates went missing. I want an exact picture of what happened.” I sat in the office and watched the rerun. Sandra came into the office, flipped on the wall light switch, paused, then looked under the stone statue on the desk, and found the desk key. She opened the desk, and found ... nothing. “Don't worry,” I said. “Just take it from there.” I handed her my newspaper. She looked around the office, saw the stack of large manila envelopes on a side table near the entrance, and opened the top envelope, shoveling my newspaper into it. “What are you doing in my office?” yelled Arnold Grossmecker as he charged through the door. He had a coat in one hand and a Smith & Wesson in the other. The woman, Brigid Jellicoe, followed him in. “Brigid, tie up her hands!” Grossmecker yelled. I could see Brigid Jellicoe ducking back into her outer office. She dropped her coat, produced some string from her desk, entered Grossmecker’s office once again, and quickly tied Brigid’s hands behind her back. Nobody went near the large manila envelope,which Sandra had dropped on the floor. Then the light switch was flipped off by someone in the doorway. That same someone crashed into the room, hat and overcoat still on, a revolver in his right hand. “Hands up!” said Quentin Jesselton. He advanced into the room, walked back and forth, and asked Sandra if she was all right. She murmured yes. After a moment, the light switch was flipped back on by Jesselton. He untied Sandra’s hands, and she picked up the manila envelope from the floor. Then she and Jesselton slowly backed out of the room.
