    "full_text": "The Midwestern States Car Club was huge, boasting over 200 members throughout a five state area. Gary, Ben, Gerald, Mike and Tommy all lived in the same town and had been good friends for over 20 years. They, with their spouses, met often to talk about classic automobiles. The club’s yearly convention and auto show was to be in Springfield next month. And on a beautiful spring evening, the friends met at Ben and Debbie’s home for dinner and conversation. They had much to talk about, as all 10 of them planned to attend the out of town convention. But, Ben had more on his mind than the upcoming convention. He was troubled by something that had happened at the meet last year. Tonight, he would share his concern with the group. After dinner, which had been hamburgers charcoaled on the Hamilton’s outside patio grill, Ben sipped on a Coke and said, “Someone in our group put a dent in my Corvair’s door at the meet last year. I know who it was but have hoped all of this time that he would come forward and admit it.” Ben paused, measuring his words carefully, and then continued, “It was on the lower portion of the door and not a serious dent. It was easily repaired, but it kept me out of the competition for Best Restoration.” Everyone, including Debbie, went silent and looked intently at Ben. Ben owned a 1964 Corvair Monza. One of the first American compact cars, it was air cooled with its engine in the rear. Ben’s was a beautiful automobile, which had been restored to pristine condition. It was painted sea green and sported red line tires. It sat low to the ground, which assisted in keeping it stabilized for safety. Rolling (the Corvair had a high center of gravity, causing it to tip over and roll when turning swiftly at high speeds) was the main issue with the Corvair and had been publicized by a well-known consumer advocate, sounding its death knell to the American public. Ben had made certain this issue was addressed with his Monza. Ben surprised the group again by telling them that a week after returning from Springfield last year, he had received an anonymous gift of $250 via money order and an apology for the dent mishap. He knew the unknown offender felt badly about his mistake but did not wish to own up to it. “Still,” he told them, “this needs to come to light. We are all friends here and I wish for us to remain so. I know the person who sent the money order has felt terrible all year. It’s time to address this and get it behind us.” Tommy Flowers, the owner of a beautiful yellow 1968 Ford Mustang coupe with wide oversize tires, 302 engine, four on the floor transmission and the most emotional of the friends, asked pointedly, “I didn’t know anyone had dented your car. Who was it?” Slowly, Ben answered, “I’m not ready to say. I’m going to explain what happened and see if you can figure it out. I would rather you tell me. I do not wish to accuse an old friend unless it is absolutely necessary.” Gary Riggs, the proud owner of a 1959 Chevrolet Impala four door with pronounced tail fins, offered, “We all remember that you pulled out of the judging, but you never explained why.” Doc McCroy, the owner of a vintage low slung 1966 Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray with 427 engine, wire wheels and removable hard top, wasn’t happy either with Ben’s words and said, “OK, Ben, you began this discussion. Start explaining.” Ben replied, “It was Friday afternoon before the judging on Saturday. I drove over and parked in front of the park pavilion. I went inside to get a Coke from the snack bar. My cell phone rang and I hung around inside for a while. When I came out, there was a nasty dent in the passenger side door. I would have missed it, but the entrance to the pavilion was to the right of the Corvair. I saw it when I came out of the building.” Mike Benson, the least emotional of the friends and owner of a red 1967 Mustang coupe with a black vinyl interior, six cylinder engine and automatic transmission, asked, “Did anyone come in or out of the pavilion while you were there?” “Not that I noticed, but for a short time I was engaged on a business call and was preoccupied.” “So, you didn’t see anyone?” “That’s right,” answered Ben. “Were there any paint scratches on your door?” “No. It looked like they had been wiped away.” Ben was silent for a moment, and then offered, “There was some fresh oil in the parking place next to me. I saw tire tracks. There was nothing unusual about them except that I noticed they were very close to the Corvair.” Doc asked, “Did you notice anything else?” “No.” Everyone sat in silence for a long awkward moment. The wives said nothing, knowing this was something the men would have to work out. Debbie silently prayed that her husband knew what he was doing. Gary finally said, “OK. We need to figure this out. This is disturbing, but you are too old a friend to make this accusation lightly.” Debbie said, “When you went to the pavilion, I went with the Riggs to the grocery store. We picked up some chips and Cokes for the snack supper.” Debbie managed a weak grin and said, “Riding in a 1959 Impala is a lot roomier than the Corvair.” Tommy looked at Ben, asking, “May I ask a couple of questions?” “I wish you would,” replied Ben. Looking at Doc, Tommy asked, “Where were you that Friday afternoon? “I was washing and waxing the ‘vette.” Turning to Mike, Tommy asked, “What about you? As I recall, you were not at the judging either. Why not?” “Well, I had a radiator leak. Most of you know that cooling systems were and remain the Achilles Heel of the 1960s model Ford Mustangs. I was leaking all the way to Springfield and simply could not get it repaired in time for Saturday.” Tommy considered this for a moment and then said to the group, “I know who did this. Why don’t you admit it now before somebody has to accuse you?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  First fix the moment of the accident  \n   •  It occurred on Friday afternoon, while Ben was inside the park pavilion.  \n   •  Debbie and the Riggs left in Gary’s big Impala to buy groceries – that removes both Gary and Debbie from the scene.  \n   •  Doc says he stayed at the motel, washing and waxing his Corvette – if that is true, he too was not there.  \n   •  Mike’s 6-cylinder Mustang had a cooling-system (radiator) problem.  Radiator fluid is green or pink and watery, not black and slick like engine oil.  Ben saw “fresh oil” on the pavement, so the leaker could not have been Mike.  \n   •  That leaves only one member of the group who is not accounted for: Tommy Flowers.\n\n2.  Look at the physical clues Ben noticed  \n   •  “Fresh oil in the parking place next to me.”  \n   •  “Tire tracks … very close to the Corvair.”  \n   •  A dent “on the LOWER portion of the passenger door” with the paint hastily wiped away.\n\n   Tommy’s yellow ’68 Mustang is the only car in the circle that is:\n        – Famous for dripping a little oil from its small-block V-8 (common on late-60s Fords).  \n        – Equipped with “wide oversize tires.”  Wider tires leave a broader pattern and, when you swing in tight to a space, they come closer to the car beside you – exactly what Ben noticed.  \n        – Higher off the ground than Ben’s low-slung Corvair.  When the Mustang door is opened beside the very low Corvair, the door edge strikes the lower half of the Corvair’s door – precisely where the dent was found.\n\n3.  Motive / state of mind  \n   •  Nobody had a real motive to damage the car; it was clearly an accident.  \n   •  Tommy is described as “the most emotional of the friends.”  An emotional person who feels guilty is the very one most likely to send an anonymous money-order apology instead of facing his friend.\n\n4.  Tommy’s behaviour at the dinner  \n   •  He quickly turns the spotlight on the others, asking accusatory questions.  \n   •  When neither Doc nor Mike can be tied to the scene, Tommy suddenly announces, “I know who did this.”   \n   The classic guilty-party ploy: appear to be the detective so no one will look at you.\n\nPutting opportunity, the mechanical/oil clue, the tyre clue and the dent-height clue together, Tommy Flowers is the only person who fits every fact Ben observed.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGary Riggs, Doc McCroy, Mike Benson, Tommy Flowers\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTommy Flowers\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFriday afternoon, Tommy drove his wide-tyred yellow ’68 Mustang up to the pavilion to grab a snack or talk to someone.  Seeing the empty spot beside Ben’s Corvair he pulled in, but the big tyres forced him right up against the Corvair’s line.  When he pushed his driver’s door open, the edge of that door swung down and struck the very low passenger door of Ben’s Monza, creasing the lower panel.  Tommy heard/felt the hit, climbed out, and in a panic wiped the Corvair’s door with a cloth to remove the thin yellow paint mark his door had left.  He re-parked elsewhere and left quickly – the little pool of engine-oil that his Mustang habitually drips remained in the space, and his wide tyre prints showed how dangerously close he had parked.  Ashamed, Tommy later mailed an anonymous money order for $250 along with an unsigned apology.  For a year he hoped the matter would fade, but when Ben finally raised it, Tommy tried to shift suspicion by questioning the others – until the circumstantial evidence pointed straight back at him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Gary Riggs – At the critical time he and his wife had Debbie with them in the Impala on a grocery run.  His car and he were physically elsewhere.  \n•  Doc McCroy – Doc was at the motel washing and waxing his Corvette; moreover, the Corvette sits as low as the Corvair, so its door would strike the Corvair much higher, not on the lower panel that was damaged.  \n•  Mike Benson – Mike’s problem was coolant, not oil, and radiator fluid does not look or feel like the “fresh oil” Ben saw on the pavement.  In addition, Mike admitted his Mustang wasn’t moving around town because of the leak; he never drove it to the pavilion on Friday.  \nOnly Tommy had no alibi, owned the only car that would both drip engine oil and leave wide tyre tracks right up against Ben’s Corvair, and whose door edge would dent the lower part of Ben’s passenger door.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

    "reveal_text": "The guilty person never felt lower. Softly, he said to Ben, “I know I should have told you. I started to a thousand times. I just never had the courage. Guess I’m not as tough as I act.”\nBen looked at his guilty friend and felt pity and compassion. He had known for a long time that he was not as tough or gruff as he let on. Ben said to Tommy, “Would you explain how you came to your conclusion?”\n“All I had to do was pay close attention to what we have been talking about. I know it wasn’t me and you knew it too when you saw that the tire marks made in the oil puddle were not made by my oversized tires. You realized it wasn’t Mike when you learned that he pulled out of the judging because of a radiator leak which appeared on the drive to the meet, for you did not mention antifreeze being on the pavement. I have no doubt that Debbie was with the Riggs at the store in the Impala at the exact time you were in the pavilion.”\nPausing, Tommy continued, “That leaves you, Doc. Your ‘vette is the only sports car in the group and the only one that sits low enough to dent a Corvair on the lower part of a passenger door. The Mustangs and Impala sit too high up to be able to do that.”\nSheepishly, Doc said, “I’m sorry, Ben, I just couldn’t bring myself to confess to it. I hope you will forgive me for being weak. You are right to call me out on this. But, I didn’t lie when I told you I wash washing and waxing the ‘vette that day. I was hot and thirsty after polishing so I drove to the pavilion for a cold drink. I was in a hurry as I had not yet cleaned the interior and pulled into the parking space too close to Ben. When I saw that he was in the corner of the snack bar on the phone and did not notice me, I hurried back out, wiped the scratch mark down and left.”\nAn awkward silence lasted for several long moments before Gary said, “Ben, I don’t think we should hold this against Doc. He’s apologized and admitted his mistake. Besides, he did send the money order.”\nBen thought for a moment before saying, “I don’t intend to hold a grudge. I’ve done a few things in my time I’m not too proud of.” Looking at Doc and smiling thinly, he added, “I believe now is a good time to have some ice cream.”",

Looking at Doc, Tommy asked, “Where were you that Friday afternoon? “I was washing and waxing the ‘vette.” Turning to Mike, Tommy asked, “What about you? As I recall, you were not at the judging either. Why not?” “Well, I had a radiator leak. Most of you know that cooling systems were and remain the Achilles Heel of the 1960s model Ford Mustangs. I was leaking all the way to Springfield and simply could not get it repaired in time for Saturday.” Tommy considered this for a moment and then said to the group, “I know who did this. Why don’t you admit it now before somebody has to accuse you?”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Gary Riggs; (b) Gerald \"Doc\" McCroy; (c) Mike Benson; (d) Tommy Flowers",
      "answer": "(b) Gerald \"Doc\" McCroy",
      "outcome": "The guilty person never felt lower. Softly, he said to Ben, “I know I should have told you. I started to a thousand times. I just never had the courage. Guess I’m not as tough as I act.”\nBen looked at his guilty friend and felt pity and compassion. He had known for a long time that he was not as tough or gruff as he let on. Ben said to Tommy, “Would you explain how you came to your conclusion?”\n“All I had to do was pay close attention to what we have been talking about. I know it wasn’t me and you knew it too when you saw that the tire marks made in the oil puddle were not made by my oversized tires. You realized it wasn’t Mike when you learned that he pulled out of the judging because of a radiator leak which appeared on the drive to the meet, for you did not mention antifreeze being on the pavement. I have no doubt that Debbie was with the Riggs at the store in the Impala at the exact time you were in the pavilion.”\nPausing, Tommy continued, “That leaves you, Doc. Your ‘vette is the only sports car in the group and the only one that sits low enough to dent a Corvair on the lower part of a passenger door. The Mustangs and Impala sit too high up to be able to do that.”\nSheepishly, Doc said, “I’m sorry, Ben, I just couldn’t bring myself to confess to it. I hope you will forgive me for being weak. You are right to call me out on this. But, I didn’t lie when I told you I wash washing and waxing the ‘vette that day. I was hot and thirsty after polishing so I drove to the pavilion for a cold drink. I was in a hurry as I had not yet cleaned the interior and pulled into the parking space too close to Ben. When I saw that he was in the corner of the snack bar on the phone and did not notice me, I hurried back out, wiped the scratch mark down and left.”\nAn awkward silence lasted for several long moments before Gary said, “Ben, I don’t think we should hold this against Doc. He’s apologized and admitted his mistake. Besides, he did send the money order.”\nBen thought for a moment before saying, “I don’t intend to hold a grudge. I’ve done a few things in my time I’m not too proud of.” Looking at Doc and smiling thinly, he added, “I believe now is a good time to have some ice cream.”"
