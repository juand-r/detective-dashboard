    "full_text": "The Midwestern States Car Club was huge, boasting over 200 members throughout a five state area. Gary, Ben, Gerald, Mike and Tommy all lived in the same town and had been good friends for over 20 years. They, with their spouses, met often to talk about classic automobiles. The club’s yearly convention and auto show was to be in Springfield next month. And on a beautiful spring evening, the friends met at Ben and Debbie’s home for dinner and conversation. They had much to talk about, as all 10 of them planned to attend the out of town convention. But, Ben had more on his mind than the upcoming convention. He was troubled by something that had happened at the meet last year. Tonight, he would share his concern with the group. After dinner, which had been hamburgers charcoaled on the Hamilton’s outside patio grill, Ben sipped on a Coke and said, “Someone in our group put a dent in my Corvair’s door at the meet last year. I know who it was but have hoped all of this time that he would come forward and admit it.” Ben paused, measuring his words carefully, and then continued, “It was on the lower portion of the door and not a serious dent. It was easily repaired, but it kept me out of the competition for Best Restoration.” Everyone, including Debbie, went silent and looked intently at Ben. Ben owned a 1964 Corvair Monza. One of the first American compact cars, it was air cooled with its engine in the rear. Ben’s was a beautiful automobile, which had been restored to pristine condition. It was painted sea green and sported red line tires. It sat low to the ground, which assisted in keeping it stabilized for safety. Rolling (the Corvair had a high center of gravity, causing it to tip over and roll when turning swiftly at high speeds) was the main issue with the Corvair and had been publicized by a well-known consumer advocate, sounding its death knell to the American public. Ben had made certain this issue was addressed with his Monza. Ben surprised the group again by telling them that a week after returning from Springfield last year, he had received an anonymous gift of $250 via money order and an apology for the dent mishap. He knew the unknown offender felt badly about his mistake but did not wish to own up to it. “Still,” he told them, “this needs to come to light. We are all friends here and I wish for us to remain so. I know the person who sent the money order has felt terrible all year. It’s time to address this and get it behind us.” Tommy Flowers, the owner of a beautiful yellow 1968 Ford Mustang coupe with wide oversize tires, 302 engine, four on the floor transmission and the most emotional of the friends, asked pointedly, “I didn’t know anyone had dented your car. Who was it?” Slowly, Ben answered, “I’m not ready to say. I’m going to explain what happened and see if you can figure it out. I would rather you tell me. I do not wish to accuse an old friend unless it is absolutely necessary.” Gary Riggs, the proud owner of a 1959 Chevrolet Impala four door with pronounced tail fins, offered, “We all remember that you pulled out of the judging, but you never explained why.” Doc McCroy, the owner of a vintage low slung 1966 Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray with 427 engine, wire wheels and removable hard top, wasn’t happy either with Ben’s words and said, “OK, Ben, you began this discussion. Start explaining.” Ben replied, “It was Friday afternoon before the judging on Saturday. I drove over and parked in front of the park pavilion. I went inside to get a Coke from the snack bar. My cell phone rang and I hung around inside for a while. When I came out, there was a nasty dent in the passenger side door. I would have missed it, but the entrance to the pavilion was to the right of the Corvair. I saw it when I came out of the building.” Mike Benson, the least emotional of the friends and owner of a red 1967 Mustang coupe with a black vinyl interior, six cylinder engine and automatic transmission, asked, “Did anyone come in or out of the pavilion while you were there?” “Not that I noticed, but for a short time I was engaged on a business call and was preoccupied.” “So, you didn’t see anyone?” “That’s right,” answered Ben. “Were there any paint scratches on your door?” “No. It looked like they had been wiped away.” Ben was silent for a moment, and then offered, “There was some fresh oil in the parking place next to me. I saw tire tracks. There was nothing unusual about them except that I noticed they were very close to the Corvair.” Doc asked, “Did you notice anything else?” “No.” Everyone sat in silence for a long awkward moment. The wives said nothing, knowing this was something the men would have to work out. Debbie silently prayed that her husband knew what he was doing. Gary finally said, “OK. We need to figure this out. This is disturbing, but you are too old a friend to make this accusation lightly.” Debbie said, “When you went to the pavilion, I went with the Riggs to the grocery store. We picked up some chips and Cokes for the snack supper.” Debbie managed a weak grin and said, “Riding in a 1959 Impala is a lot roomier than the Corvair.” Tommy looked at Ben, asking, “May I ask a couple of questions?” “I wish you would,” replied Ben. Looking at Doc, Tommy asked, “Where were you that Friday afternoon? “I was washing and waxing the ‘vette.” Turning to Mike, Tommy asked, “What about you? As I recall, you were not at the judging either. Why not?” “Well, I had a radiator leak. Most of you know that cooling systems were and remain the Achilles Heel of the 1960s model Ford Mustangs. I was leaking all the way to Springfield and simply could not get it repaired in time for Saturday.” Tommy considered this for a moment and then said to the group, “I know who did this. Why don’t you admit it now before somebody has to accuse you?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWho could have dented the Corvair?\n\t•\tOnly someone who was in Springfield on Friday afternoon and who parked in the stall to the right of Ben’s Corvair could have done it.  \n\t•\tThe person’s car left two things behind:\n\t\t–\t“Fresh oil in the parking place.”  \n\t\t–\t“Tire tracks … very close to the Corvair.”  Ben stresses that the tracks were unusually close; that would happen only if the tyres on the neighbouring car stuck out farther than normal.\n\n2.\tWhich of the four friends’ cars fits those clues?\n\t•\tGary Riggs – 1959 Impala.  Normal-width tyres, tail-fins but no hint of leakage.  Besides, he and Debbie were away at the grocery store in the Impala at the time.  \n\t•\tDoc McCroy – 1966 Corvette Sting Ray.  Low-slung, standard sized tyres; Doc says he spent the whole afternoon “washing and waxing the ’vette.”  His alibi is unchallenged, and his tyres would not protrude.  \n\t•\tMike Benson – 1967 Mustang (six-cyl.).  His trouble was a radiator leak (coolant, not engine oil).  The story emphasises that Ford cooling systems, not oil systems, were his problem.  His car has stock tyres.  \n\t•\tTommy Flowers – 1968 Mustang with “wide oversize tyres” and a 302 V-8.  That model / engine combination often drips a little oil, and the extra-wide tyres would force Tommy to hug the left-hand line of his stall, putting his wheels—and therefore his driver’s door—closer to Ben’s low-slung Corvair than any ordinary car would come.\n\n3.\tWhy did Ben already “know” the culprit?\n\t•\tWhen he returned to the lot he saw an oil spot and the unmistakably wide tread pattern of oversize tyres.  \n\t•\tAmong his circle of friends, only one car at Springfield carried such tyres: Tommy’s yellow ’68 Mustang.  That single distinctive clue was enough for Ben.  \n\t•\tThe anonymous $250 money order confirmed his suspicion; only a person ashamed of the accident but unwilling to confess would do that.\n\n4.\tBehavioural evidence\n\t•\tTommy is described as “the most emotional of the friends.”  At the dinner he tries to seize the initiative, peppering Doc and Mike with questions and then announcing “I know who did this,” plainly attempting to redirect suspicion before it falls on him—classic guilty behaviour.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTommy Flowers, Gary Riggs, Doc McCroy, Mike Benson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nTommy Flowers\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFriday afternoon, the day before judging, Ben Hamilton parked his low-slung 1964 Corvair in the space immediately left of the pavilion entrance.  \nA few minutes later Tommy Flowers pulled into the space on the Corvair’s right in his yellow 1968 Mustang.  Because his Mustang wore extra-wide tyres, Tommy had to stay far to the left of his slot; the tyres rolled almost against the Corvair, leaving the “tire tracks very close” that Ben noticed.  \nTommy’s V-8 leaked a few drops of oil as he shut down.  When he climbed out, the edge of his driver’s door struck the lower half of the Corvair’s passenger door—low because the Corvair itself sits low.  Realising what he had done, Tommy wiped the smudge of yellow paint from Ben’s green door, but the dent remained.  Upset, he drove away.  \nLater, still ashamed, he mailed Ben a $250 money order with an unsigned apology.  \nBen, recognising the wide-tread marks and the oil drip, silently identified Tommy as the only possible culprit.  At the Hamiltons’ supper a year later, Ben brought the matter up hoping Tommy would finally confess.  Rather than admit it, Tommy tried to shift attention to Doc and Mike.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nGary Riggs – He was at the grocery store with Debbie in the Impala at the crucial time; his car does not have oversize tyres and is not noted for oil leaks.  \nDoc McCroy – Was seen by others washing and waxing the Corvette, a plausible alibi uncontradicted by any clue.  His car sits low and has normal tyres, so it could not have left the tell-tale close tracks.  \nMike Benson – His Mustang’s problem was a coolant leak, not an oil leak.  Stock tyres mean he could not have left the extra-wide tread pattern that caught Ben’s eye.  Nothing ties him to the pavilion at the right moment.  \nOnly Tommy’s wide-tyred, oil-dripping Mustang fits every physical clue and every behavioural clue, making him—and only him—the guilty party.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The guilty person never felt lower. Softly, he said to Ben, “I know I should have told you. I started to a thousand times. I just never had the courage. Guess I’m not as tough as I act.”\nBen looked at his guilty friend and felt pity and compassion. He had known for a long time that he was not as tough or gruff as he let on. Ben said to Tommy, “Would you explain how you came to your conclusion?”\n“All I had to do was pay close attention to what we have been talking about. I know it wasn’t me and you knew it too when you saw that the tire marks made in the oil puddle were not made by my oversized tires. You realized it wasn’t Mike when you learned that he pulled out of the judging because of a radiator leak which appeared on the drive to the meet, for you did not mention antifreeze being on the pavement. I have no doubt that Debbie was with the Riggs at the store in the Impala at the exact time you were in the pavilion.”\nPausing, Tommy continued, “That leaves you, Doc. Your ‘vette is the only sports car in the group and the only one that sits low enough to dent a Corvair on the lower part of a passenger door. The Mustangs and Impala sit too high up to be able to do that.”\nSheepishly, Doc said, “I’m sorry, Ben, I just couldn’t bring myself to confess to it. I hope you will forgive me for being weak. You are right to call me out on this. But, I didn’t lie when I told you I wash washing and waxing the ‘vette that day. I was hot and thirsty after polishing so I drove to the pavilion for a cold drink. I was in a hurry as I had not yet cleaned the interior and pulled into the parking space too close to Ben. When I saw that he was in the corner of the snack bar on the phone and did not notice me, I hurried back out, wiped the scratch mark down and left.”\nAn awkward silence lasted for several long moments before Gary said, “Ben, I don’t think we should hold this against Doc. He’s apologized and admitted his mistake. Besides, he did send the money order.”\nBen thought for a moment before saying, “I don’t intend to hold a grudge. I’ve done a few things in my time I’m not too proud of.” Looking at Doc and smiling thinly, he added, “I believe now is a good time to have some ice cream.”",

This is disturbing, but you are too old a friend to make this accusation lightly.” Debbie said, “When you went to the pavilion, I went with the Riggs to the grocery store. We picked up some chips and Cokes for the snack supper.” Debbie managed a weak grin and said, “Riding in a 1959 Impala is a lot roomier than the Corvair.” Tommy looked at Ben, asking, “May I ask a couple of questions?” “I wish you would,” replied Ben. Looking at Doc, Tommy asked, “Where were you that Friday afternoon? “I was washing and waxing the ‘vette.” Turning to Mike, Tommy asked, “What about you? As I recall, you were not at the judging either. Why not?” “Well, I had a radiator leak. Most of you know that cooling systems were and remain the Achilles Heel of the 1960s model Ford Mustangs. I was leaking all the way to Springfield and simply could not get it repaired in time for Saturday.” Tommy considered this for a moment and then said to the group, “I know who did this. Why don’t you admit it now before somebody has to accuse you?”",

      "answer": "(b) Gerald \"Doc\" McCroy",
      "outcome": "The guilty person never felt lower. Softly, he said to Ben, “I know I should have told you. I started to a thousand times. I just never had the courage. Guess I’m not as tough as I act.”\nBen looked at his guilty friend and felt pity and compassion. He had known for a long time that he was not as tough or gruff as he let on. Ben said to Tommy, “Would you explain how you came to your conclusion?”\n“All I had to do was pay close attention to what we have been talking about. I know it wasn’t me and you knew it too when you saw that the tire marks made in the oil puddle were not made by my oversized tires. You realized it wasn’t Mike when you learned that he pulled out of the judging because of a radiator leak which appeared on the drive to the meet, for you did not mention antifreeze being on the pavement. I have no doubt that Debbie was with the Riggs at the store in the Impala at the exact time you were in the pavilion.”\nPausing, Tommy continued, “That leaves you, Doc. Your ‘vette is the only sports car in the group and the only one that sits low enough to dent a Corvair on the lower part of a passenger door. The Mustangs and Impala sit too high up to be able to do that.”\nSheepishly, Doc said, “I’m sorry, Ben, I just couldn’t bring myself to confess to it. I hope you will forgive me for being weak. You are right to call me out on this. But, I didn’t lie when I told you I wash washing and waxing the ‘vette that day. I was hot and thirsty after polishing so I drove to the pavilion for a cold drink. I was in a hurry as I had not yet cleaned the interior and pulled into the parking space too close to Ben. When I saw that he was in the corner of the snack bar on the phone and did not notice me, I hurried back out, wiped the scratch mark down and left.”\nAn awkward silence lasted for several long moments before Gary said, “Ben, I don’t think we should hold this against Doc. He’s apologized and admitted his mistake. Besides, he did send the money order.”\nBen thought for a moment before saying, “I don’t intend to hold a grudge. I’ve done a few things in my time I’m not too proud of.” Looking at Doc and smiling thinly, he added, “I believe now is a good time to have some ice cream.”"
