    "full_text": "Zeb pulled his coat tight against the cold rain, and then saw the restaurant. It was two days before Christmas, Dec. 23, 1814. Lightning flashed over the Gulf of Mexico, revealing five enormous sails fluttering in the wind. Everyone knew the ships were there to attack. “Molly's,” read a large sign swinging in the rain. Zeb pushed open the door. He heard the townspeople of New Orleans gabbing excitedly while they ate. “I'm loading my shotgun!” “That'll scare the British away.” “We've captured hundreds of their ships.” “They burned Washington.” “ ‘We,’ ‘they’ – you’re all just men stuffing your fat faces,” Molly said, delivering a plate of hot sausage. There was laughter and shouts as the restaurant's hefty owner brought their meals, but not one familiar face, Zeb noted. “Maybe they're not British ships,” joked Marie, a small waitress. “Maybe Napoleon wants us back!” Eleven years earlier New Orleans belonged to the French, until their emperor sold the territory to President Thomas Jefferson as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Zeb searched the faces looking for the man who could help him, but Molly's small restaurant was filled only with the people of the town, their voices filled with excitement. Then the door opened, and in walked Ezekiel, his long scraggly hair still wet from the rain. He seemed just as anxious to get out of the cold. “Did you see the sails?” Ezekiel asked, looking worried. Zeb nodded. “General Jackson saw them too,” Ezekiel whispered. “But we have a problem.” Zeb scanned the faces in the restaurant. The British had already seized control of the shoreline ten miles south of New Orleans. The city's population was less than 40,000, and now foreign soldiers were preparing to invade. Andrew Jackson was preparing a defense. He had fortified his own troops with Choctaw Indians, pirates from Barataria Bay, 500 African-American soldiers and militias from Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Before the British could invade and to give his men time to prepare the defense, Jackson would send his troops to attack them. Tonight. “But the British will know he's coming.” Lightning struck outside. “How?” Zeb asked. “Someone just spotted the troop movements through the swamp, and is planning to meet the British commander here tonight. They're going to deliver the warning in a letter,” Ezekiel explained. “If the British receive it, Jackson's surprise attack will fail.” Zeb carefully scanned the crowd again. “What do they want with New Orleans?” Marie teased. “The Mississippi river!” yelled a burly sailor. “And everything west of it!” Someone in this restaurant had been sent ahead to warn the British. But who? “They ate President Madison's dinner!” “And burned his house!” “I heard Davy Crockett himself fought alongside General Jackson.” “What do we need Davy Crockett for when we've got your shot-gun?” Zeb and Ezekiel searched for suspects, and one face stood out in the crowd. The burly sailor sat across from a wealthy-looking man in a leather vest, wearing a wide, stylish hat. A pirate? Zeb and Ezekiel approached his table, and asked if they could join him for dinner. His name was Jean, and he readily agreed. “ ‘Tis too cold a night to deny you the warmth of my fine company,” Jean said grandly. Ezekiel asked casually what his line of business was. “I'm a privateer,” Jean said with a laugh. He reached slyly into his jacket pocket and pulled out a yellow parchment. “It’s signed by the U.S. Congress itself. I'm authorized to plunder the British ships!” He roared with laughter. “Don't you dare call him a pirate,” said Jean's companion, a sailor named Smith. “Marie, more rum!” shouted Jean. “Leave her alone!” shouted Molly protectively, pushing her thick spectacles back. “Marie's been working since noon.” Smith had arrived in Louisiana all the way from Maine, which would raise anyone's suspicion, since the New England states had threatened to secede. “Even if we are at war, money's money,” Smith said, patting down his wet hair. “There's money to be made in trading with Britain,” he added. “But me, I hate them. We beat them already, 36 years ago. Do we have to fight a second war of independence?” Molly delivered a warm plate to the sailor, piled high with slices of roast beef and steaming potatoes. Ezekiel leaned across the table and whispered a secret theory. “Maybe Molly is the British contact.” “They've already captured our gunboats,” Molly said to Smith with a laugh. “And it's so close to Christmas,” Smith joked back, drawing a big laugh from Jean the privateer. Molly leaned into the sailor's face, and said: “Standing so close to you, I can finally see your face, Mr. Smith. And it's an ugly one!” The sailor laughed loudly as Molly covered her spectacles in mock horror. Zeb and Ezekiel scanned the rest of the restaurant. It was getting late, and most of the other customers had left. One of the four people who remained was waiting for the British commander. “Read my letter from the U.S. Congress!” Jean said with a laugh. “It entitles me to plunder the British ships – and I don't even know how to read!” New Orleans would fall to the British unless Zeb and Ezekiel could identify their contact. Suddenly, the door swung open. A white-haired gentleman with a long, sharp nose had entered the restaurant, surveying the crowd and calling out for a meal. He said he was in a hurry. Ezekiel walked Zeb towards the door, then whispered: “Don't worry. I know who's delivering the warning letter to the British.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Historical background  \n   •  The date is 23 December 1814, two weeks before the real Battle of New Orleans.  \n   •  In actual history the local privateer Jean Lafitte helped Andrew Jackson, while many New-England merchants (especially from Maine and Massachusetts) quietly aided the British because the war hurt their shipping trade.  \n   •  Therefore a privateer flying the U.S. flag is far less likely to betray Jackson than a New-England trader looking for profit.  \n\n2. Who is still in the room when the traitor must act?  \n   After most diners leave only four customers remain:  \n        – Zeb (the detective)  \n        – Ezekiel (his partner)  \n        – Jean, the self-styled privateer  \n        – Smith, a sailor “all the way from Maine”  \n   The staff (Molly and Marie) are not part of that count, so the letter-carrier must be Jean or Smith.  \n\n3. Motive  \n   •  Jean produces a parchment he believes is a U.S. letter-of-marque authorising him to attack British ships.  His livelihood depends on fighting, not helping, the British.  \n   •  Smith openly admits that “money’s money” and that there is “money to be made in trading with Britain.”  New-Englanders of 1814 were famous for that attitude and even talked of seceding from the Union.  He therefore has a strong financial motive to prevent Jackson’s victory and keep the port open to British trade.  \n\n4. Opportunity & physical evidence  \n   •  Smith is the only one whose pockets, bags or papers have not been displayed.  He could easily have the warning letter concealed under his slick, rain-soaked coat.  \n   •  Jean has already shown the only parchment he carries, and it is nothing the British would need—they would hardly risk an agent’s life to receive a document issued by the U.S. Congress!  \n   •  Smith arrived with wet hair and clothes—he has already been out in the storm once tonight, exactly what the courier of a secret message would have to do.  \n\n5. The white-haired newcomer  \n   As soon as the unknown white-haired gentleman steps inside “in a hurry,” Ezekiel whispers that he now knows who the courier is.  The traitor therefore has to be one of the men already seated who can immediately hand over a letter.  Again, that leaves only Jean or Smith.  \n\n6. Historical consistency & final deduction  \n   Given Lafitte’s well-known assistance to the Americans and Smith’s open talk of commerce with the enemy, Smith is the logical traitor.  Ezekiel would have reached the same conclusion the instant the British officer appeared in the doorway.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJean Lafitte, Mr. Smith, Molly, Marie, Ezekiel, the white-haired gentleman\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nMr. Smith (first name unknown), the sailor from Maine\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1.  British scouts spot Jackson’s column moving through the swamp.  \n2.  They scribble a warning letter and give it to their shore-side agent—Mr. Smith—telling him to hand it to the British commander who will ride up to Molly’s that evening.  \n3.  Smith hurries through the rain to Molly’s, arrives dripping wet and joins Jean at a table.  To deflect suspicion he boasts about hating the British while also praising the profits of trading with them.  \n4.  Jean, friendly and none too sober, shows off his letter-of-marque without realising that Smith is carrying a very different letter hidden under his coat.  \n5.  When the white-haired British officer arrives to collect the note, Zeb and Ezekiel are watching.  Ezekiel, having weighed motive, opportunity, and the fact that Jean has already displayed his only document, identifies Smith as the courier before the hand-off can occur.  \n6.  Smith is arrested, the warning never reaches the British, and Jackson’s night attack goes ahead.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Jean Lafitte – Historically aided Jackson; already displayed the only paper on his person, a U.S. letter-of-marque useless to the British.  \n•  Molly – Never leaves the counter, is fiercely patriotic, and has no practical chance to meet the British officer outside.  \n•  Marie – Busy serving tables, no sign of a hidden letter or secret rendez-vous.  \n•  Ezekiel – Brings the information to Zeb and helps unmask the traitor; no motive to sabotage his own mission.  \n•  White-haired gentleman – Is the British recipient, not the courier.  He is the enemy commander, not the spy who warned him.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

So how could he write a warning letter to the British?”\n“It's Marie, the waitress,” Zeb suggested.\n“No, Molly said that Marie had been working here since noon. So she couldn't have spotted General Jackson's troops in the swamp. Besides, Marie's lived in this town since 1803. I doubt she'd want to see it invaded.\"\n“Maybe Molly herself saw those troops,” Zeb suggested.\n“With those spectacles and her bad eyesight?

What happened in the days to come would thrill the country, making legends of the men who planned it. As the people of New Orleans came together to help defend their town, the people of America would feel they'd proved themselves as a nation. It was history in the making, and would be remembered for centuries to come.\nZeb looked worriedly after the white-haired man with the long, sharp nose.\n“Shouldn't we try to intercept the commander?” Zeb asked.\n“Commander?” Ezekiel said, and he started to laugh. “That's Andrew Jackson!”",

I doubt she could see anybody – especially on such a rainy day!”\nEzekiel looked quickly back at Smith. “But speaking of rain, did you notice there's one man here whose hair is still wet?”\n“Smith! The man who said ‘Money's money, even if we're at war!’”\n“I bet there's even more money in selling military secrets...”\nAlarmed, Zeb started to move towards the table, but Ezekiel stopped him, and they walked out into the night.\nThe rain had finally stopped, and once outside, Ezekiel pulled a sheet of paper from his jacket. Scribbled hastily across it was a warning about the coming American attack. “I stole it from Smith's pocket,” he said with a laugh.\n“Won't he notice it's missing?”\n“I replaced it with a letter saying the Americans didn't suspect a thing,” Ezekiel laughed. “Then I sealed it with the same wax stamp. He'll deliver the wrong message – without even knowing it!”\nI looked back and saw the white-haired gentleman leave the restaurant, strolling into the clear starlit night. What happened in the days to come would thrill the country, making legends of the men who planned it. As the people of New Orleans came together to help defend their town, the people of America would feel they'd proved themselves as a nation. It was history in the making, and would be remembered for centuries to come.\nZeb looked worriedly after the white-haired man with the long, sharp nose.\n“Shouldn't we try to intercept the commander?” Zeb asked.\n“Commander?” Ezekiel said, and he started to laugh. “That's Andrew Jackson!”"
