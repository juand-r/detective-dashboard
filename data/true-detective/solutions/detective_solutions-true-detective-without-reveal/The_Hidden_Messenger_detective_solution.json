    "full_text": "Zeb pulled his coat tight against the cold rain, and then saw the restaurant. It was two days before Christmas, Dec. 23, 1814. Lightning flashed over the Gulf of Mexico, revealing five enormous sails fluttering in the wind. Everyone knew the ships were there to attack. “Molly's,” read a large sign swinging in the rain. Zeb pushed open the door. He heard the townspeople of New Orleans gabbing excitedly while they ate. “I'm loading my shotgun!” “That'll scare the British away.” “We've captured hundreds of their ships.” “They burned Washington.” “ ‘We,’ ‘they’ – you’re all just men stuffing your fat faces,” Molly said, delivering a plate of hot sausage. There was laughter and shouts as the restaurant's hefty owner brought their meals, but not one familiar face, Zeb noted. “Maybe they're not British ships,” joked Marie, a small waitress. “Maybe Napoleon wants us back!” Eleven years earlier New Orleans belonged to the French, until their emperor sold the territory to President Thomas Jefferson as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Zeb searched the faces looking for the man who could help him, but Molly's small restaurant was filled only with the people of the town, their voices filled with excitement. Then the door opened, and in walked Ezekiel, his long scraggly hair still wet from the rain. He seemed just as anxious to get out of the cold. “Did you see the sails?” Ezekiel asked, looking worried. Zeb nodded. “General Jackson saw them too,” Ezekiel whispered. “But we have a problem.” Zeb scanned the faces in the restaurant. The British had already seized control of the shoreline ten miles south of New Orleans. The city's population was less than 40,000, and now foreign soldiers were preparing to invade. Andrew Jackson was preparing a defense. He had fortified his own troops with Choctaw Indians, pirates from Barataria Bay, 500 African-American soldiers and militias from Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Before the British could invade and to give his men time to prepare the defense, Jackson would send his troops to attack them. Tonight. “But the British will know he's coming.” Lightning struck outside. “How?” Zeb asked. “Someone just spotted the troop movements through the swamp, and is planning to meet the British commander here tonight. They're going to deliver the warning in a letter,” Ezekiel explained. “If the British receive it, Jackson's surprise attack will fail.” Zeb carefully scanned the crowd again. “What do they want with New Orleans?” Marie teased. “The Mississippi river!” yelled a burly sailor. “And everything west of it!” Someone in this restaurant had been sent ahead to warn the British. But who? “They ate President Madison's dinner!” “And burned his house!” “I heard Davy Crockett himself fought alongside General Jackson.” “What do we need Davy Crockett for when we've got your shot-gun?” Zeb and Ezekiel searched for suspects, and one face stood out in the crowd. The burly sailor sat across from a wealthy-looking man in a leather vest, wearing a wide, stylish hat. A pirate? Zeb and Ezekiel approached his table, and asked if they could join him for dinner. His name was Jean, and he readily agreed. “ ‘Tis too cold a night to deny you the warmth of my fine company,” Jean said grandly. Ezekiel asked casually what his line of business was. “I'm a privateer,” Jean said with a laugh. He reached slyly into his jacket pocket and pulled out a yellow parchment. “It’s signed by the U.S. Congress itself. I'm authorized to plunder the British ships!” He roared with laughter. “Don't you dare call him a pirate,” said Jean's companion, a sailor named Smith. “Marie, more rum!” shouted Jean. “Leave her alone!” shouted Molly protectively, pushing her thick spectacles back. “Marie's been working since noon.” Smith had arrived in Louisiana all the way from Maine, which would raise anyone's suspicion, since the New England states had threatened to secede. “Even if we are at war, money's money,” Smith said, patting down his wet hair. “There's money to be made in trading with Britain,” he added. “But me, I hate them. We beat them already, 36 years ago. Do we have to fight a second war of independence?” Molly delivered a warm plate to the sailor, piled high with slices of roast beef and steaming potatoes. Ezekiel leaned across the table and whispered a secret theory. “Maybe Molly is the British contact.” “They've already captured our gunboats,” Molly said to Smith with a laugh. “And it's so close to Christmas,” Smith joked back, drawing a big laugh from Jean the privateer. Molly leaned into the sailor's face, and said: “Standing so close to you, I can finally see your face, Mr. Smith. And it's an ugly one!” The sailor laughed loudly as Molly covered her spectacles in mock horror. Zeb and Ezekiel scanned the rest of the restaurant. It was getting late, and most of the other customers had left. One of the four people who remained was waiting for the British commander. “Read my letter from the U.S. Congress!” Jean said with a laugh. “It entitles me to plunder the British ships – and I don't even know how to read!” New Orleans would fall to the British unless Zeb and Ezekiel could identify their contact. Suddenly, the door swung open. A white-haired gentleman with a long, sharp nose had entered the restaurant, surveying the crowd and calling out for a meal. He said he was in a hurry. Ezekiel walked Zeb towards the door, then whispered: “Don't worry. I know who's delivering the warning letter to the British.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could have a reason for helping the British?\n\n•  Molly – a prosperous Creole who would lose everything if the city fell.  No motive at all.  \n•  Marie – a poor waitress who has been “working since noon”; she has had no chance to leave the restaurant to watch troop movements or to compose a letter.  \n•  Sailor “Smith” – a New-Englander.  Many New-Englanders opposed the war because it hurt their commerce, so he certainly has a possible motive.  \n•  Jean – calls himself a “privateer” and waves a parchment that he claims is “signed by the U.S. Congress.”  At the time, real letters-of-marque were issued by the President and the Secretary of State, not “signed by Congress.”  Jean is therefore lying about his document, so he must be carrying some other sort of letter.  Jean is also the only person who admits to making his living off whichever side will pay him – exactly the sort of man the British tried to hire in real life.\n\n2. Who had the opportunity actually to hand a written warning to the British commander?\n\nThe commander will arrive as a stranger and order a meal.  \n•  Molly and Marie would have to slip him a letter in front of everyone in the room – difficult because everyone watches them pass the plates around.  \n•  Smith and Jean are seated and can simply stand up, greet the commander, and hand him the paper.  Either could do it, but…\n\n3. Who is physically in possession of a letter right now?\n\nOnly one person.  Jean has a yellow parchment already in his jacket.  Smith has nothing.  Molly and Marie have nothing.\n\n4. Could Jean even read what he is carrying?\n\nHe loudly boasts he “doesn’t even know how to read,” but he also boasts that the document is “signed by the U.S. Congress.”  If he cannot read, how does he know what it says?  The claim is obviously a bluff to keep anyone from asking to examine it.\n\n5. What convinced Ezekiel?\n\nWhile Smith’s anti-war talk is suspicious, there is no hard evidence against him.  Jean, however, has the essential physical evidence (the parchment), has lied about it, and has the pirate/privateer background that gives him the clearest motive for betraying Jackson for money.  That is why, just after Jean flourishes his “letter,” Ezekiel whispers that he now knows who the spy is.\n\nTherefore the only logical culprit is the man who is already carrying the treacherous letter – Jean.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJean (the “privateer”), Smith (sailor from Maine), Molly (restaurant owner), Marie (waitress)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJean  – alias “Jean the privateer” (clearly meant to be Jean Lafitte)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring the afternoon someone loyal to the British noticed Jackson’s troops moving through the swamp.  \nThat spy wrote a warning and entrusted it to Jean, a well-known pirate/privateer whose loyalty belongs to whoever pays him.  Jean agreed to carry the message because the British had already offered him money and a pardon for past crimes if he would help them take New Orleans.\n\nPosing as a patriotic privateer, Jean entered Molly’s restaurant and waited for the rendez-vous.  To keep anyone from asking to read the paper, he showed it openly and claimed it was a U.S. letter-of-marque “signed by Congress,” adding that he “could not read anyway.”\n\nLate that night the British commander (the white-haired gentleman who hurried in from the storm) walked through the door to collect the warning.  Before Jean could pass the parchment, Zeb and Ezekiel—having noticed that Jean alone possessed a mysterious document, lied about it, and had the strongest motive—placed him under arrest and saved Jackson’s surprise attack.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Molly:  Her thick spectacles and remark that she “can finally see” Smith’s face show she is extremely near-sighted; she could not have “spotted the troop movements through the swamp.”  She has been in the restaurant all day and never possessed a letter.\n\n•  Marie:  Molly states Marie has “been working since noon,” giving her a solid alibi.  She never leaves the dining room and has no paper or opportunity to write a warning.\n\n•  Smith:  His New-England origin and talk of wartime profits are suspicious, but he never shows or mentions a letter, and nothing ties him directly to the British commander.  He talks too openly to be the careful courier Ezekiel is hunting.\n\nJean is the only person with motive, opportunity, and – crucially – the incriminating physical evidence in his pocket.  Hence Jean is the spy who meant to betray Jackson’s night attack. </WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It was history in the making, and would be remembered for centuries to come.\nZeb looked worriedly after the white-haired man with the long, sharp nose.\n“Shouldn't we try to intercept the commander?” Zeb asked.\n“Commander?” Ezekiel said, and he started to laugh. “That's Andrew Jackson!”",

Scribbled hastily across it was a warning about the coming American attack. “I stole it from Smith's pocket,” he said with a laugh.\n“Won't he notice it's missing?”\n“I replaced it with a letter saying the Americans didn't suspect a thing,” Ezekiel laughed. “Then I sealed it with the same wax stamp. He'll deliver the wrong message – without even knowing it!”\nI looked back and saw the white-haired gentleman leave the restaurant, strolling into the clear starlit night. What happened in the days to come would thrill the country, making legends of the men who planned it. As the people of New Orleans came together to help defend their town, the people of America would feel they'd proved themselves as a nation. It was history in the making, and would be remembered for centuries to come.\nZeb looked worriedly after the white-haired man with the long, sharp nose.\n“Shouldn't we try to intercept the commander?” Zeb asked.\n“Commander?” Ezekiel said, and he started to laugh. “That's Andrew Jackson!”"
