    "full_text": "Ed Beatty arrived at the train station half an hour before boarding time. He had booked a New York to Los Angeles train ride weeks ago and looked forward to it with child-like enthusiasm. However, he did not know that one of the porters assigned to his sleeper car was none other than the infamous Robert Fennell, a convict who had escaped after a dozen years in prison. Fennell was a larger-than-life character and the most famous of his generation of criminals. Fennell, now forty-four years of age, was a cat burglar, jewel thief, safecracker and bank robber par excellence; a master of disguises and a man of seemingly endless aliases. Now, he posed as a train porter to earn a few dollars and move freely about the country to avoid law enforcement. Ed and the railroad line would soon learn this the hard way. Ed did indeed look forward to a hard earned vacation, and the three day trip to Los Angeles to visit old friends was simply the first portion of it, for he intended to sail on a cruiseship and visit foreign ports before heading back to home and work. Boarding time for the train was ten a.m. Porter 1 warmly greeted him at the entrance to his car, took his baggage and stowed it for him in his first class cabin. Ed noticed the man to be a bit clumsy but politely said nothing. Ed spent the remainder of the morning putting his things away. Even the staterooms on railroad trains are not overly spacious, so Ed organized as well as he could. After this, he took a short nap before lunch. Porter 2, a distinguished looking man of perhaps forty, knocked upon Ed’s door around noon to announce that the dining room was open. Ed thought, “This man is much too elegant to be a porter on a train”, but considered that perhaps the railroad put its best foot forward for first class travelers. Moreover, Porter 2 possessed impeccable manners, as he had assisted Porter 1 in welcoming “Mr. Beatty” earlier that day and had embarrassedly apologized for momentarily forgetting Ed’s name. Ed thought nothing of it; Porter 2 had welcomed dozens of passengers aboard earlier that morning. “The poor fellow must be getting tired”, he thought. Returning from lunch, where he had spent a pleasant hour dining with and getting to know his fellow first class travelers, Ed returned to his cabin and took another nap before dinner. At six p.m., the third porter came on duty. Porter 3 appeared to be about forty-five and was not as friendly as the others—in fact he seemed slightly standoffish, although he was cordial and greeted Ed with a tip of his cap and politely but formally informed him that the dining car was open for the evening meal. Perhaps because he had just come on duty, Ed noticed Porter 3’s uniform to be especially well-fitted and freshly pressed. Ed enjoyed a wonderful meal and drinks at the bar with new friends afterward. After sleeping most of the day, he wasn’t tired at all and did not return to his stateroom until almost eleven p.m. At that time, he met Porter 4 in the hallway outside his cabin. The men exchanged perfunctory greetings underneath the bright light of Ed’s door as he started to enter his room to undress for bed. Ed, a private investigator for an insurance company and a keen observer of people and places, thought Porter 4 to be a little young to be a senior porter on a major railroad line, as he could not have been more than thirty years old. Still, the youngish looking porter deftly opened the door and ushered Ed inside in what seemed to be one sweeping motion. Climbing into the comfortable stateroom bed, Ed thought no more of the graceful young porter as the excellent meal and cocktails, along with the gentle rocking of the big passenger train, quickly put him to sleep. The next morning, Ed awoke before the breakfast announcement. As he washed and dressed to prepare for the day, he found that his briefcase, with his personal papers and foreign passport, was missing. Ed quickly reported this to the chief porter, who in turn notified passenger security. Ed, himself an experienced investigator, had a general idea of what happened but didn’t really learn the truth until speaking with his railroad counterpart. After explaining to Alan Webb, chief of security, what had happened, Webb shook his head and sadly said, “We learned after departing New York that one of our first class porters is, in fact, Robert Fennell. One of his prison pals told the local authorities, hoping to avoid execution next week. The problem is we don’t know which one he is, as all of the porters in your car are borrowed from other lines for this trip.” Ed knew well Fennell’s background and reputation. Ed explained his own professional background to Webb, who welcomed having another investigative mind to assist him. Ed said, “Well that explains how somebody could steal my briefcase from right under my nose. Fennell is the best thief in the business. He hasn’t lost his touch. Still, I believe we can figure this out. In fact, I’m pretty sure we can.” Alan Webb asked, “What makes you think so?” “Because I came into personal contact with all four of the first class car porters. I noticed quite a bit about them.” “OK. What did you notice?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Who could have a reason to steal Ed Beatty’s brief-case?  \n   –  None of the regular railroad porters gain anything by taking a passenger’s passport and papers; they would be risking the loss of their jobs for very little reward.  \n   –  Robert Fennell, on the other hand, is an escaped master thief who needs money and false identity papers to keep ahead of the police.  A foreign passport is extremely useful to him.  Therefore the only person with a strong motive is the porter who is really Robert Fennell.\n\n2.  What do we know about Fennell?  \n   –  Age: 44.  \n   –  Physically adept (cat burglar), elegant when he chooses, master of disguises.  \n   –  Used to “working alone,” therefore he will try to keep to himself and avoid any prolonged conversation that may reveal slips.\n\n3.  What did Ed notice about each porter?\n\n   Porter 1 – first shift (morning)  \n     • Clumsy, almost dropped the baggage.  \n     • Friendly enough, but nothing remarkable.  \n     • A clumsy cat-burglar is an oxymoron; agility is Fennell’s trade-mark.  \n     • Had no long period alone with Ed’s stateroom (Ed was inside it most of that shift).  \n     • Least likely candidate.\n\n   Porter 2 – second shift (mid-day)  \n     • “Distinguished,” “too elegant,” impeccable manners, about 40.  \n     • Momentarily forgot Ed’s name although he had just welcomed him earlier.  \n     • Was seen together with Porter 1 earlier; therefore there are at least two different men on board – Porter 2 cannot be a costume change of Porter 1.  \n     • He had only a short window (while Ed lunched) and Ed returned to the cabin for a nap; had the case already been missing, Ed would almost certainly have noticed when he lay down.  \n     • Possible, but something still doesn’t fit: Ed did not mention anything odd about his uniform.\n\n   Porter 3 – third shift (6 p.m.-10 p.m.)  \n     • About 45, slightly standoffish, kept conversation to a minimum.  \n     • What leapt out at Ed: his uniform was “especially well-fitted and freshly pressed.”  \n       –  The railroad admitted later that all four porters were borrowed from other lines for this single trip.  \n       –  Borrowed men get whatever standard size uniform the road can issue at the last minute – normally the fit is mediocre and the clothing already shows travel wrinkles.  \n       –  A perfectly tailored, freshly pressed uniform can only belong to someone who supplied his own—exactly what a fugitive in disguise would do.  \n     • His whole shift occurred while Ed was away dining and drinking (6–11 p.m.) – a five-hour stretch in which Ed’s stateroom was empty and Porter 3 held the passkey.  \n     • He therefore had by far the best opportunity.\n\n   Porter 4 – fourth shift (night)  \n     • Far too young – “could not have been more than thirty.”  \n     • Graceful and friendly.  \n     • Age is the main problem: Fennell is 44; passing for a man barely 30 is far harder than passing for 40-45.  \n     • When Porter 4 ushered Ed into the compartment the case was presumably already gone; Porter 4 had the briefest contact and was bathed in the bright doorway light, hardly the behaviour of a wanted man who fears recognition.\n\n4.  Time frame of the theft  \n   –  Ed saw and probably would have noticed the case at 11 p.m. had it already been missing; the fact that he says nothing suggests it vanished after 6 p.m. and before he returned, i.e. during Porter 3’s watch.  \n   –  If it had been removed earlier, Ed would almost certainly have seen the empty spot when he lay down for his afternoon nap.\n\n5.  Putting it all together  \n   • Motive  – only Porter 3 (really Fennell) needed the passport.  \n   • Opportunity – the longest uninterrupted access to the empty cabin.  \n   • Physical evidence – custom-fit immaculate uniform inconsistent with a hastily borrowed porter.  \n   • Behaviour – aloof, speaks as little as possible, the safest tactic for a man hiding an alias.\n\nTherefore, Porter 3 must be Robert Fennell and the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPorter 1, Porter 2, Porter 3, Porter 4\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nRobert Fennell (posing as Porter 3)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Before the trip Robert Fennell acquired (or tailored) a first-class porter’s uniform that fitted him perfectly.  \n• He volunteered for the Los-Angeles run, joining three genuine porters who were temporarily “borrowed” from other lines.  \n• From New York departure until 6 p.m. he stayed in the background, letting Porters 1 and 2 deal with passengers (avoiding any chance of recognition).  \n• At 6 p.m. he relieved them as Porter 3.  As soon as Ed Beatty left his compartment for dinner and drinks, Fennell used his master key, slipped in, opened the brief-case, removed the passport and any saleable documents and valuables, then carefully closed everything so the missing item would not be noticed for hours.  \n• He hid the loot in a place only he could reach (probably his own locked locker in the crew section).  \n• When his shift ended at 10 p.m. he turned the car over to Porter 4 and blended back in with the other employees, confident that the crime would not be discovered until morning when the trail would be cold.  \n• The next day Beatty discovered the loss, but his keen eye for the “too-perfect” uniform and the timing of the shifts allowed him (and us) to expose Porter 3 as Fennell.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nPorter 1 – Clumsy, but was on duty while Ed was in the compartment; had no realistic window to search and steal without being observed.  His ill-fitting, travel-worn uniform matches a man borrowed at the last minute.\n\nPorter 2 – Although elegant and around the right age, his shift overlapped Ed’s lunch only briefly, and the brief-case was still present afterwards when Ed napped.  Moreover, his uniform did not stand out; it looked like everyone else’s.\n\nPorter 4 – Too young (≈30) to be the 44-year-old Fennell.  When he met Ed the theft had already been committed; he merely ushered Ed inside and left immediately, behaviour consistent with an ordinary night porter.\n\nHence only Porter 3, a.k.a. Robert Fennell, fits every clue.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Ed Beatty took his time before answering, and then began, “I rule out Porter 4. He has to be too young. Fennell is still young, forty-four, if what you say is true, but not the thirty-ish man I met outside my room. Porter 4 was certainly deft enough to be a cat burglar and safe cracker, as he was very quick and graceful ushering me into my room. He also could have been in disguise, but I got a clear look at him underneath the bright light. He is as young as he appears.\nWebb merely nodded and motioned for him to continue. “It would not be Porter 2, either. He appears to be the right age. He has the demeanor and social graces of one who has traveled easily in the upper crusts of society. However, two things eliminate him as Fennell: he forgot my name, and became flustered when he did so. Sophisticated criminals neither forget names nor lose their poise. Fennell especially.”\nWebb was impressed with this first class passenger who happened to be in the same profession as he and told him so. “You noticed much. More importantly, you are able to make sense of it.”\nEd nodded his head in acknowledgment. He liked the railroad security man as much as Investigator Webb liked him. He continued. “It couldn’t have been Porter 1. Porter 1 was friendly enough and, had I spent more time around him, would possibly have seen that he possesses the engaging personality of Robert Fennell. However, the man was slightly clumsy and, as you know, clumsiness is one of the hardest of human characteristics to emulate and act out.”\nAlan Webb and his victim-turned-co-investigator sat in silence for a few minutes. Both agreed, without saying so, that Ed Beatty’s observations were squarely on the mark. Finally, Webb stated, “It had to be Porter 3.”\n“Yeah, it had to be. Porter 3 was what you would expect from somebody like Fennell in his situation. He was not overly friendly; not rude but slightly aloof, not wishing to draw attention to himself. For sure he was the right age. His uniform was well pressed and fit very well—a sure sign that he paid attention to his physique and appearance. As I look back on my short encounter with him, I see his professional charm and manner, for it would not do to have anyone he came into contact with even remotely suspect he was the legendary Robert Fennell.\nWebb said. “Mighty good work, Mr. Beatty.”\n“Call me Ed. I assume you have somebody watching all four porters?”\n“Oh yes. They are in the rear holding tank until we finish our conversation. I believe we will have quite the story for the police when we arrive in Los Angeles. By the way, we found your briefcase in a passenger’s compartment in the next car over. Unless I am greatly mistaken, we will find your passport somewhere in Porter 3’s private quarters”\nThe men looked at each other, Mutual respect and the beginnings of a lasting friendship were their rewards for solving the case of Ed Beatty’s missing baggage quickly and professionally.\nAlan Webb had one more question.\n“Ed, would you like a job with the railroad?”",

I noticed quite a bit about them.” “OK. What did you notice?”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Porter 1; (b) Porter 2; (c) Porter 3; (d) Porter 4",
      "answer": "(c) Porter 3",
      "outcome": "Ed Beatty took his time before answering, and then began, “I rule out Porter 4. He has to be too young. Fennell is still young, forty-four, if what you say is true, but not the thirty-ish man I met outside my room. Porter 4 was certainly deft enough to be a cat burglar and safe cracker, as he was very quick and graceful ushering me into my room. He also could have been in disguise, but I got a clear look at him underneath the bright light. He is as young as he appears.\nWebb merely nodded and motioned for him to continue. “It would not be Porter 2, either. He appears to be the right age. He has the demeanor and social graces of one who has traveled easily in the upper crusts of society. However, two things eliminate him as Fennell: he forgot my name, and became flustered when he did so. Sophisticated criminals neither forget names nor lose their poise. Fennell especially.”\nWebb was impressed with this first class passenger who happened to be in the same profession as he and told him so. “You noticed much. More importantly, you are able to make sense of it.”\nEd nodded his head in acknowledgment. He liked the railroad security man as much as Investigator Webb liked him. He continued. “It couldn’t have been Porter 1. Porter 1 was friendly enough and, had I spent more time around him, would possibly have seen that he possesses the engaging personality of Robert Fennell. However, the man was slightly clumsy and, as you know, clumsiness is one of the hardest of human characteristics to emulate and act out.”\nAlan Webb and his victim-turned-co-investigator sat in silence for a few minutes. Both agreed, without saying so, that Ed Beatty’s observations were squarely on the mark. Finally, Webb stated, “It had to be Porter 3.”\n“Yeah, it had to be. Porter 3 was what you would expect from somebody like Fennell in his situation. He was not overly friendly; not rude but slightly aloof, not wishing to draw attention to himself. For sure he was the right age. His uniform was well pressed and fit very well—a sure sign that he paid attention to his physique and appearance. As I look back on my short encounter with him, I see his professional charm and manner, for it would not do to have anyone he came into contact with even remotely suspect he was the legendary Robert Fennell.\nWebb said. “Mighty good work, Mr. Beatty.”\n“Call me Ed. I assume you have somebody watching all four porters?”\n“Oh yes. They are in the rear holding tank until we finish our conversation. I believe we will have quite the story for the police when we arrive in Los Angeles. By the way, we found your briefcase in a passenger’s compartment in the next car over. Unless I am greatly mistaken, we will find your passport somewhere in Porter 3’s private quarters”\nThe men looked at each other, Mutual respect and the beginnings of a lasting friendship were their rewards for solving the case of Ed Beatty’s missing baggage quickly and professionally.\nAlan Webb had one more question.\n“Ed, would you like a job with the railroad?”"
