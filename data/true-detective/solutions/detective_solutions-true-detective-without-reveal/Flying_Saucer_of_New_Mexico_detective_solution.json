    "full_text": "Larry and Zach agreed about one thing that the military reported a gigantic hot-air balloon that crashed into the desert in 1947, filled with top-secret research equipment. But Zach insisted that this was just a story to conceal what the military really discovered - a mysterious flying saucer from outer space. There was nothing but desert around them, but the highway would lead to Zach's uncle Art. He'd retired to a trailer in the desert and had spent the years watching the skies for asteroids and hoping for the chance to spot lost interplanetary spaceships. But the first mystery was finding where Uncle Art lived! Unfortunately, Zach didn't know the road's name and only remembered that it was the sixth dirt road past state route 246. Larry worried that instead of counting the roads, Zach was concentrating more on convincing him to believe in spaceships! \"Art doesn't say there are aliens landing in New Mexico,\" Zach insisted. \"But at least he keeps an open mind.” Larry finally pointed the truck onto the sixth dirt road, which led to Art's trailer, in back of a fruit stand by the side of the highway. Art flung open the door, thrilled to see his nephew. He was mostly bald, with funny tufts of white hair, and he was wearing faded blue overalls and a red flannel shirt. \"Zach!\" he shouted. \"I'm excited to see you again!\" A young woman also emerged from Art's trailer. \"This is Dora, from the fruit stand next door,\" Art said. \"She brought me fresh vegetables so I could make you boys some stew! I've been telling everyone that I'm getting a visit from two smart youngsters from out of state. Dora was impressed that you'd drive so far just to see your uncle Art!\" And that was when they saw the flying saucer... First there was a strange noise sounding like an engine roaring to life, but then they felt a strange blast of wind. An enormous cloud of dust rose in the darkened desert, along with weird humming noises oscillating up and down. Then a glow started shining from inside the dust cloud. Soon the source of the glow had lifted above the cloud of dust, and they could see what it was -- an enormous metal craft moving slowly towards the sky! \"What in tarnation?\" said Uncle Art, as Zach and Larry stared in amazement. Dora snapped a picture with her ever-present camera, but in the next second - the flying ship was gone! There was nothing but New Mexico darkness and an eerie silence, as the dust cloud billowed up to swallow the rest of the evening sky. They all stood dazed for a moment, but the desert world returned to normal with just the soft sound of crickets and a noisy truck on the freeway behind them. \"Well, son of a gun,\" said Uncle Art. \"Amazing, a flying starcraft!\" said Dora. \"You're under arrest,\" shouted a voice behind them. They turned to see a tall man in a cowboy hat. Art laughed, and said \"That's just Lester. He's a real joker. He runs the gift shop next to Dora's fruit stand. He just got back to America tonight after spending a week visiting his cousin in Italy!\" \"I make jokes to keep smiling!” Lester kidded back. \"There's barely enough visitors to keep the two of us in business. Poor Dora couldn't support her family if it weren't for her husband's construction firm. And unfortunately, I'm not even married!\" They all laughed at Lester's joke, and Uncle Art invited him in for stew. Dora hurried home for the evening, while Uncle Art told Lester what they'd seen. \"You must feel pretty proud of yourself,\" Lester said. \"After all these years of watching the skies, you finally saw something to brag about!\" \"I won't be bragging,\" Art said. \"I don't want a bunch of alien hunters running around in my yard!\" Zach felt a twinge of concern. \"I knew that you'd been watching the skies at night,\" he told Uncle Art, \"but were people making fun of you for it?\" The old man didn't say anything for a second. He just stared thoughtfully, chewing his stew, looking proud and even a little brave. \"You can't let other people tell you what to believe,\" he said firmly. That night Zach and Larry slept in their sleeping bags in Uncle Art's trailer, and when the sun came up, they rushed to where they'd seen the flying saucer. The desert sand was firm, packed down by years of heat and rain. It was easy to see where the blast of dust had come from - a round circle where the sand was mashed down, right in the spot where they'd scene the flying saucer. But there was something else in the sand. \"Tire tracks!\" From the mashed-down sand led a trail of two parallel lines, each line nearly one foot wide, like the treads of a bulldozer. They followed the trailer, but it joined a dirt road that soon led to the highway. \"It sure is dusty here,\" Zach said. \"Look at me! I'm a spaceship!\" He jumped on the ground, and a cloud of dust billowed up around him. He even jokingly tried to make the weird humming noise the spaceship made last night. \"Oo-oo-oo...\" Larry told him that sounded even worse than his singing. When Zach and Larry returned to the trailer, Uncle Art had a concerned look on his face. Even Zach wondered what he was worrying about, and his uncle decided to share a secret. \"Today in the mail I got a strange letter. It's postmarked from Santa Fe, from a TV station. It says 'Please call us to discuss yesterday's flying starcraft.'\" Uncle Art looked genuinely puzzled. \"I've never said I was an expert on aliens!\" \"Are you sure you didn't call them?\" said Lester, from inside the trailer. \"Maybe you want to be a big-shot!\" Lester had been visiting Art when the mailman brought the letter. \"Or maybe it's you who wants to be a big shot,\" Uncle Art replied. \"Some extra publicity certainly would help your gift shop attract more customers!\" \"Or maybe Zach phoned the TV station,\" Larry interrupted. \"You've pestered me for days about the existence of flying saucers, ever since we started driving for New Mexico!\" The four stared bitterly at each other, but finally Larry spoke up in a voice that was calm and certain. \"This letter didn't come from the TV station,\" Larry announced. \"First of all, it is not on letterhead. More importantly, a TV station would call not write a letter about news.” \"I'm beginning to think we didn't see aliens from space,\" Zach admitted. \"We just saw a particularly elaborate practical joke that someone set up in advance!\" \"If you could make a cloud of dust just jumping on the desert,\" Larry said, \"Imagine how much dust you could kick up dropping a fake 'spaceship' on the ground.\" \"But who?” Zach asked. \"Don't worry,\" Larry announced. \"I know exactly who's responsible.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  Uncle Art – explicitly says he does NOT want “a bunch of alien-hunters running around in my yard.”  \n   •  Zach – is already a believer; staging a hoax would only undercut his argument and he had no local resources.  \n   •  Larry – sceptic; same lack of resources.  \n   •  Dora – her fruit-stand survives on passing motorists; extra publicity would mean extra sales.  \n     Her husband owns a construction firm – a ready source of heavy machinery.  \n   •  Lester – owns the adjoining gift-shop and says business is bad: “Barely enough visitors to keep the two of us in business… And unfortunately, I’m not even married!”  \n     Publicity = tourists = money for the gift-shop.  \n\n   Dora and Lester share the same financial motive and stand to gain the most from a spectacular “UFO” story.\n\n2.  Opportunity / physical evidence  \n   •  The next morning there is a perfectly round, flattened circle and a pair of one-foot-wide parallel tracks that run to the highway – exactly what a bulldozer or front loader would leave.  \n   •  Dora’s husband’s company owns just such machinery. Dora had free access and the know-how.  \n   •  Lester appears “behind them” seconds after the ‘saucer’ vanishes, already in the desert instead of at his shop – strongly suggesting he had been operating or helping with the device.  \n   •  He claims he has “just got back from Italy this evening” – an uncheckable alibi tailored to explain any absence during the previous week.  \n   •  A television station would telephone about a hot story, not mail a plain sheet of paper.  \n     Someone local posted that letter from Santa Fe to lure Uncle Art into talking – the perfect way to keep the story alive.  \n     Dora or Lester could easily have driven to Santa Fe and mailed it while “business was slow.”  \n\n3.  Logical deduction  \n   •  The UFO was a ground-based prop dropped or lowered, kicked up dust (shown to occur easily) with engine noise supplied by machinery.  \n   •  Only people with motive, local knowledge, and heavy-equipment access are Dora and Lester.  \n   •  Dora had her camera ready; Lester “arrived” at the right second and began joking about “arrest.” Both behaved like show-men, not stunned witnesses.  \n   •  Therefore they are the perpetrators. Dora supplied the machine through her husband; Lester helped stage the performance and mailed the fake TV-station letter.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nUncle Art, Zach, Larry, Dora, Lester\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nDora (family name not given, fruit-stand owner)\nLester (family name not given, gift-shop owner)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone known outside Dora and Lester (Dora’s husband unknowingly supplied the machine)\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Business at the roadside fruit-stand and gift-shop was dying.  \n• Dora, who had easy access to her husband’s construction equipment, and Lester, who desperately needed customers, decided on a publicity stunt: create a “real” flying saucer sighting beside Uncle Art’s trailer (a spot already known for sky-watching).  \n• During the week Lester was supposedly “in Italy,” the pair prepared the prop saucer and hid it in the desert.  \n• That evening, while Dora was inside the trailer and before Lester made his dramatic entrance, a bulldozer or front-loader pushed/dropped the metal disk into the sand, its engine providing the humming roar and its movement whipping up a great dust cloud illuminated by flood-lights on the machine – giving the illusion of a glowing craft lifting off.  \n• Once the observers’ eyes were blinded by dust, the machine simply dragged the disk away along the dirt track to the highway, leaving the one-foot-wide tread marks discovered next morning.  \n• Lester left the machine, cut across the desert, and reappeared behind the witnesses wearing his usual clothes, claiming he had just returned from Italy and jokingly “arresting” everybody – a theatrical flourish to cement the story.  \n• The next day a phony “TV-station” letter, mailed by the pair from Santa Fe, arrived to keep the excitement alive and push Uncle Art into talking, thereby guaranteeing news coverage and tourist traffic.  \n• Result: the stunt would make headlines; tourists would swarm to see the spot, buying fruit from Dora and souvenirs from Lester.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Uncle Art – Wanted peace and quiet, and the letter would only bring unwanted crowds. He lacks equipment and motive.  \n• Zach – Believer but had no access to heavy machinery, no local contacts, and was as astonished as everyone else.  \n• Larry – Sceptic; came only with Zach. He debunked the letter and had no motive to stage what he was busy disproving.  \nTherefore only Dora and Lester possessed the combination of motive, means, and opportunity to create the hoax. </WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I've been telling everyone that I'm getting a visit from two smart youngsters from out of state.

They turned to see a tall man in a cowboy hat. Art laughed, and said \"That's just Lester. He's a real joker. He runs the gift shop next to Dora's fruit stand. He just got back to America tonight after spending a week visiting his cousin in Italy!\" \"I make jokes to keep smiling!” Lester kidded back. \"There's barely enough visitors to keep the two of us in business.

I'm a spaceship!\" He jumped on the ground, and a cloud of dust billowed up around him.

In fact, I've only heard one other person use the phrase 'flying starcraft'.\"\n\"Dora!\" shouted Lester.\nUncle Art seemed hurt, and didn't want to believe that he'd been tricked by his own neighbor.

The kind of crane that could lift a fake spaceship.\"\n\"We even heard a truck driving down the freeway right after the 'spaceship' left!” Zach said.\n\"And there's only one suspect that has access to cranes,\" Larry pointed out.\n\"Dora,\" said Zach. \"Her husband has a construction business.\"\n\"I told you she'd been hurting for business,\" said Lester.\n\"She must've been more desperate than any of us knew,\" sighed Uncle Art.\n\"Only a crane could lift a spaceship off the ground,\" Larry said. \"Then they just then cut the lights before heading onto the highway.\"\n\"But in a way, you should be proud, Uncle Art,\" said Zach. \"Because it turns out you've been right all along.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" asked uncle Art.\n\"Never let other people tell you what to believe!\"\nTheir laughed rippled through the trailer, and out into the New Mexico night.",

There was nothing but New Mexico darkness and an eerie silence, as the dust cloud billowed up to swallow the rest of the evening sky. They all stood dazed for a moment, but the desert world returned to normal with just the soft sound of crickets and a noisy truck on the freeway behind them. \"Well, son of a gun,\" said Uncle Art. \"Amazing, a flying starcraft!\" said Dora. \"You're under arrest,\" shouted a voice behind them. They turned to see a tall man in a cowboy hat. Art laughed, and said \"That's just Lester. He's a real joker. He runs the gift shop next to Dora's fruit stand. He just got back to America tonight after spending a week visiting his cousin in Italy!\" \"I make jokes to keep smiling!” Lester kidded back. \"There's barely enough visitors to keep the two of us in business. Poor Dora couldn't support her family if it weren't for her husband's construction firm. And unfortunately, I'm not even married!\" They all laughed at Lester's joke, and Uncle Art invited him in for stew. Dora hurried home for the evening, while Uncle Art told Lester what they'd seen. \"You must feel pretty proud of yourself,\" Lester said. \"After all these years of watching the skies, you finally saw something to brag about!\" \"I won't be bragging,\" Art said. \"I don't want a bunch of alien hunters running around in my yard!\" Zach felt a twinge of concern. \"I knew that you'd been watching the skies at night,\" he told Uncle Art, \"but were people making fun of you for it?\" The old man didn't say anything for a second. He just stared thoughtfully, chewing his stew, looking proud and even a little brave. \"You can't let other people tell you what to believe,\" he said firmly. That night Zach and Larry slept in their sleeping bags in Uncle Art's trailer, and when the sun came up, they rushed to where they'd seen the flying saucer. The desert sand was firm, packed down by years of heat and rain. It was easy to see where the blast of dust had come from - a round circle where the sand was mashed down, right in the spot where they'd scene the flying saucer. But there was something else in the sand. \"Tire tracks!\" From the mashed-down sand led a trail of two parallel lines, each line nearly one foot wide, like the treads of a bulldozer. They followed the trailer, but it joined a dirt road that soon led to the highway. \"It sure is dusty here,\" Zach said. \"Look at me! I'm a spaceship!\" He jumped on the ground, and a cloud of dust billowed up around him. He even jokingly tried to make the weird humming noise the spaceship made last night. \"Oo-oo-oo...\" Larry told him that sounded even worse than his singing. When Zach and Larry returned to the trailer, Uncle Art had a concerned look on his face. Even Zach wondered what he was worrying about, and his uncle decided to share a secret. \"Today in the mail I got a strange letter. It's postmarked from Santa Fe, from a TV station. It says 'Please call us to discuss yesterday's flying starcraft.'\" Uncle Art looked genuinely puzzled. \"I've never said I was an expert on aliens!\" \"Are you sure you didn't call them?\" said Lester, from inside the trailer. \"Maybe you want to be a big-shot!\" Lester had been visiting Art when the mailman brought the letter. \"Or maybe it's you who wants to be a big shot,\" Uncle Art replied. \"Some extra publicity certainly would help your gift shop attract more customers!\" \"Or maybe Zach phoned the TV station,\" Larry interrupted. \"You've pestered me for days about the existence of flying saucers, ever since we started driving for New Mexico!\" The four stared bitterly at each other, but finally Larry spoke up in a voice that was calm and certain. \"This letter didn't come from the TV station,\" Larry announced. \"First of all, it is not on letterhead. More importantly, a TV station would call not write a letter about news.” \"I'm beginning to think we didn't see aliens from space,\" Zach admitted. \"We just saw a particularly elaborate practical joke that someone set up in advance!\" \"If you could make a cloud of dust just jumping on the desert,\" Larry said, \"Imagine how much dust you could kick up dropping a fake 'spaceship' on the ground.\" \"But who?” Zach asked. \"Don't worry,\" Larry announced. \"I know exactly who's responsible.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Dora; (b) Lester; (c) Uncle Art; (d) Zach",
      "answer": "(a) Dora",
      "outcome": "\"Do you really think Uncle Art sent the letter?” Zach asked.\n\"No,\" Larry said. \"Uncle Art didn't want alien hunters in his yard, so he'd never manufacture a fake flying saucer to bring them here!\"\n\"Your smart friend Zach must've set this up,\" Lester shouted, \"so you'd be sure to see a spaceship!\"\n\"That's what I suspected,\" Larry admitted. \"But Zach doesn't even know what street his uncle lives on. So he couldn't write Art's address on this letter!\"\n\"Saved by my own stupidity!” Zach cheered. \"Maybe Lester is our practical joker.\"\n\"He's certainly a joker,\" Larry said. \"But he was in Italy all of last week. He couldn't have sent the letter, since it was postmarked from Santa Fe!\"\n\"But there's an even bigger clue in the letter,\" Larry continued. \"Notice that it asks Art to call the station about 'flying starcraft'. Those aren't the words that most people would use to describe flying saucers. In fact, I've only heard one other person use the phrase 'flying starcraft'.\"\n\"Dora!\" shouted Lester.\nUncle Art seemed hurt, and didn't want to believe that he'd been tricked by his own neighbor. Larry took a deep breath, before delivering the final clue.\n\"A spaceship wouldn't leave tread marks in the ground of the desert. But a crane might. The kind of crane that could lift a fake spaceship.\"\n\"We even heard a truck driving down the freeway right after the 'spaceship' left!” Zach said.\n\"And there's only one suspect that has access to cranes,\" Larry pointed out.\n\"Dora,\" said Zach. \"Her husband has a construction business.\"\n\"I told you she'd been hurting for business,\" said Lester.\n\"She must've been more desperate than any of us knew,\" sighed Uncle Art.\n\"Only a crane could lift a spaceship off the ground,\" Larry said. \"Then they just then cut the lights before heading onto the highway.\"\n\"But in a way, you should be proud, Uncle Art,\" said Zach. \"Because it turns out you've been right all along.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" asked uncle Art.\n\"Never let other people tell you what to believe!\"\nTheir laughed rippled through the trailer, and out into the New Mexico night."
