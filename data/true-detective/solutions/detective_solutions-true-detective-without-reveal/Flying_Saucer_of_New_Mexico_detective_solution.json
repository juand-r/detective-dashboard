    "full_text": "Larry and Zach agreed about one thing that the military reported a gigantic hot-air balloon that crashed into the desert in 1947, filled with top-secret research equipment. But Zach insisted that this was just a story to conceal what the military really discovered - a mysterious flying saucer from outer space. There was nothing but desert around them, but the highway would lead to Zach's uncle Art. He'd retired to a trailer in the desert and had spent the years watching the skies for asteroids and hoping for the chance to spot lost interplanetary spaceships. But the first mystery was finding where Uncle Art lived! Unfortunately, Zach didn't know the road's name and only remembered that it was the sixth dirt road past state route 246. Larry worried that instead of counting the roads, Zach was concentrating more on convincing him to believe in spaceships! \"Art doesn't say there are aliens landing in New Mexico,\" Zach insisted. \"But at least he keeps an open mind.” Larry finally pointed the truck onto the sixth dirt road, which led to Art's trailer, in back of a fruit stand by the side of the highway. Art flung open the door, thrilled to see his nephew. He was mostly bald, with funny tufts of white hair, and he was wearing faded blue overalls and a red flannel shirt. \"Zach!\" he shouted. \"I'm excited to see you again!\" A young woman also emerged from Art's trailer. \"This is Dora, from the fruit stand next door,\" Art said. \"She brought me fresh vegetables so I could make you boys some stew! I've been telling everyone that I'm getting a visit from two smart youngsters from out of state. Dora was impressed that you'd drive so far just to see your uncle Art!\" And that was when they saw the flying saucer... First there was a strange noise sounding like an engine roaring to life, but then they felt a strange blast of wind. An enormous cloud of dust rose in the darkened desert, along with weird humming noises oscillating up and down. Then a glow started shining from inside the dust cloud. Soon the source of the glow had lifted above the cloud of dust, and they could see what it was -- an enormous metal craft moving slowly towards the sky! \"What in tarnation?\" said Uncle Art, as Zach and Larry stared in amazement. Dora snapped a picture with her ever-present camera, but in the next second - the flying ship was gone! There was nothing but New Mexico darkness and an eerie silence, as the dust cloud billowed up to swallow the rest of the evening sky. They all stood dazed for a moment, but the desert world returned to normal with just the soft sound of crickets and a noisy truck on the freeway behind them. \"Well, son of a gun,\" said Uncle Art. \"Amazing, a flying starcraft!\" said Dora. \"You're under arrest,\" shouted a voice behind them. They turned to see a tall man in a cowboy hat. Art laughed, and said \"That's just Lester. He's a real joker. He runs the gift shop next to Dora's fruit stand. He just got back to America tonight after spending a week visiting his cousin in Italy!\" \"I make jokes to keep smiling!” Lester kidded back. \"There's barely enough visitors to keep the two of us in business. Poor Dora couldn't support her family if it weren't for her husband's construction firm. And unfortunately, I'm not even married!\" They all laughed at Lester's joke, and Uncle Art invited him in for stew. Dora hurried home for the evening, while Uncle Art told Lester what they'd seen. \"You must feel pretty proud of yourself,\" Lester said. \"After all these years of watching the skies, you finally saw something to brag about!\" \"I won't be bragging,\" Art said. \"I don't want a bunch of alien hunters running around in my yard!\" Zach felt a twinge of concern. \"I knew that you'd been watching the skies at night,\" he told Uncle Art, \"but were people making fun of you for it?\" The old man didn't say anything for a second. He just stared thoughtfully, chewing his stew, looking proud and even a little brave. \"You can't let other people tell you what to believe,\" he said firmly. That night Zach and Larry slept in their sleeping bags in Uncle Art's trailer, and when the sun came up, they rushed to where they'd seen the flying saucer. The desert sand was firm, packed down by years of heat and rain. It was easy to see where the blast of dust had come from - a round circle where the sand was mashed down, right in the spot where they'd scene the flying saucer. But there was something else in the sand. \"Tire tracks!\" From the mashed-down sand led a trail of two parallel lines, each line nearly one foot wide, like the treads of a bulldozer. They followed the trailer, but it joined a dirt road that soon led to the highway. \"It sure is dusty here,\" Zach said. \"Look at me! I'm a spaceship!\" He jumped on the ground, and a cloud of dust billowed up around him. He even jokingly tried to make the weird humming noise the spaceship made last night. \"Oo-oo-oo...\" Larry told him that sounded even worse than his singing. When Zach and Larry returned to the trailer, Uncle Art had a concerned look on his face. Even Zach wondered what he was worrying about, and his uncle decided to share a secret. \"Today in the mail I got a strange letter. It's postmarked from Santa Fe, from a TV station. It says 'Please call us to discuss yesterday's flying starcraft.'\" Uncle Art looked genuinely puzzled. \"I've never said I was an expert on aliens!\" \"Are you sure you didn't call them?\" said Lester, from inside the trailer. \"Maybe you want to be a big-shot!\" Lester had been visiting Art when the mailman brought the letter. \"Or maybe it's you who wants to be a big shot,\" Uncle Art replied. \"Some extra publicity certainly would help your gift shop attract more customers!\" \"Or maybe Zach phoned the TV station,\" Larry interrupted. \"You've pestered me for days about the existence of flying saucers, ever since we started driving for New Mexico!\" The four stared bitterly at each other, but finally Larry spoke up in a voice that was calm and certain. \"This letter didn't come from the TV station,\" Larry announced. \"First of all, it is not on letterhead. More importantly, a TV station would call not write a letter about news.” \"I'm beginning to think we didn't see aliens from space,\" Zach admitted. \"We just saw a particularly elaborate practical joke that someone set up in advance!\" \"If you could make a cloud of dust just jumping on the desert,\" Larry said, \"Imagine how much dust you could kick up dropping a fake 'spaceship' on the ground.\" \"But who?” Zach asked. \"Don't worry,\" Larry announced. \"I know exactly who's responsible.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe problem is not “What did they see?” – Larry has already found the tyre-tracks that show it was a piece of heavy earth-moving machinery that raised the dust cloud and the noise.  \nThe real question is “Who would borrow a bulldozer (tracks almost a foot wide), haul it out to the sixth dirt road, fire it up at exactly the moment the four witnesses walked outside, and then hurry back, pretending to be as surprised as everybody else?”\n\nMotive  \n•  Uncle Art – least likely.  He has spent years sky-watching and explicitly says he does NOT want crowds of “alien hunters” in his yard.  \n•  Zach – would love to “prove” UFOs to Larry, but he is an out-of-state visitor with no local contacts or machinery and he did not even remember the name of the road.  \n•  Larry – a sceptic; staging a hoax would defeat his own purpose.  \n•  Dora – her fruit stand would profit from publicity, and her husband owns a construction firm (access to a bulldozer).  But Dora was standing with the others the whole time the craft appeared, snapping pictures.  She could not simultaneously be driving the machine.  \n•  Lester – the gift-shop owner openly complains that there are “barely enough visitors” for him and Dora to stay in business.  A spectacular “UFO sighting” only metres from his shop would bring in crowds.  He has no wife, so no one to contradict any alibi he gives.  He could easily borrow machinery from Dora’s husband’s company (“construction firms” commonly rent out plant overnight) and he almost certainly knew the boys’ arrival time: Art “had been telling everyone” about the visit.\n\nOpportunity  \nThe bulldozer tracks run straight to the highway.  Someone could drive the machine into a waiting low-loader or park it behind roadside bushes, change clothes, and walk back to Art’s trailer in minutes.  That is exactly what Lester must have done – he appears moments later from behind the group, shouting “You are under arrest!”  (The dramatic entrance explains why he is out of breath – hence the “tall man in a cowboy hat” arriving a second or two late.)  \nLester’s alibi that he had “just got back from Italy tonight” is the giveaway: no one catches an international flight, drives hundreds of kilometres into the desert and still turns up in pristine clothes five minutes after landing.  It is only meant to prove he could not possibly have staged the hoax – therefore we should suspect the opposite.\n\nPhysical evidence  \n•  One-foot-wide tread marks = bulldozer or front-loader.  \n•  Humming/roaring sound = diesel engine.  \n•  Sudden glow = flood-light or welding arc rigged on the machine.  \n•  Instant disappearance = machine drove away inside its own dust cloud; the roar heard afterward was “a noisy truck on the freeway” – really the bulldozer being hauled away.\n\nFake letter  \nThe fake “TV-station” letter is pure publicity bait.  A real newsroom would telephone.  It was mailed from Santa Fe, close enough for Lester to post it on a routine supply trip earlier that week.  He was also conveniently present when the mail arrived, ready to watch reactions and steer suspicion.\n\nTherefore, taking motive, opportunity, physical clues and the phoney alibi together, the only logical culprit is Lester.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nUncle Art, Zach, Larry, Dora, Dora’s husband, Lester\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLester  (gift-shop owner; surname not given)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Art has told “everyone” that his nephew Zach and friend Larry will visit on a particular evening.  \n2. Seeing a chance for publicity, Lester borrows (or hires through Dora’s husband’s construction firm) a bulldozer or front-loader, welds a big circular sheet of aluminium to the bucket, mounts flood-lights on it, and practises raising and lowering the bucket to make the “craft” appear to lift off.  \n3. Shortly before dusk he drives the machine to a spot a short distance behind Art’s trailer, waits with engine idling.  \n4. When the four people step outside for air, he revs the engine, lowers then quickly raises the bucket, switches on the flood-lights and slews the machine upward, blasting sand and dust.  The glowing metal disk is seen “rising”.  \n5. Using the swirling dust for cover, he kills the lights, drops the bucket, turns the machine round and drives hard for the highway, leaving the 30-foot circular imprint and the wide caterpillar tracks.  \n6. At the highway a confederate or a hired low-loader is waiting; the machine is winched aboard (its roar is the “noisy truck on the freeway”), tarped, and driven away.  \n7. Lester changes into clean clothes behind the roadside buildings, walks up behind the group, and makes a comic entrance: “You’re under arrest!”  \n8. Next morning the fake letter (mailed earlier from Santa Fe) arrives, trying to push Art into contacting the media and thus guaranteeing tourist traffic to Lester’s gift shop.  \n9. Larry notices the bulldozer tracks, realises the “UFO” was machinery, spots the bogus letterhead and confronts the others.  \n10. Lester’s transparent “I was in Italy” alibi collapses; he is the only person with both motive and opportunity.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nUncle Art – Would repel tourists, not attract them; no access to heavy machinery; genuinely startled.  \nZach – Had no idea which road to take, could not have prepared the hoax or posted the letter from Santa Fe days earlier.  \nLarry – Sceptic, and he exposed the fraud; no motive to prove UFOs exist.  \nDora – Present during the sighting, camera in hand; could not physically drive the bulldozer at the same time.  Her only “motive” would have been increased fruit-stand traffic, but her husband’s firm supplies Lester with the machinery – she is merely an unknowing conduit.  \nDora’s husband – May have rented out the equipment but had no personal stake; nothing places him at the scene.\n\nAll clues point solely to Lester, the gift-shop owner.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

First there was a strange noise sounding like an engine roaring to life, but then they felt a strange blast of wind. An enormous cloud of dust rose in the darkened desert, along with weird humming noises oscillating up and down. Then a glow started shining from inside the dust cloud. Soon the source of the glow had lifted above the cloud of dust, and they could see what it was -- an enormous metal craft moving slowly towards the sky! \"What in tarnation?\" said Uncle Art, as Zach and Larry stared in amazement. Dora snapped a picture with her ever-present camera, but in the next second - the flying ship was gone! There was nothing but New Mexico darkness and an eerie silence, as the dust cloud billowed up to swallow the rest of the evening sky. They all stood dazed for a moment, but the desert world returned to normal with just the soft sound of crickets and a noisy truck on the freeway behind them. \"Well, son of a gun,\" said Uncle Art. \"Amazing, a flying starcraft!\" said Dora. \"You're under arrest,\" shouted a voice behind them. They turned to see a tall man in a cowboy hat. Art laughed, and said \"That's just Lester. He's a real joker. He runs the gift shop next to Dora's fruit stand. He just got back to America tonight after spending a week visiting his cousin in Italy!\" \"I make jokes to keep smiling!” Lester kidded back. \"There's barely enough visitors to keep the two of us in business. Poor Dora couldn't support her family if it weren't for her husband's construction firm. And unfortunately, I'm not even married!\" They all laughed at Lester's joke, and Uncle Art invited him in for stew. Dora hurried home for the evening, while Uncle Art told Lester what they'd seen. \"You must feel pretty proud of yourself,\" Lester said. \"After all these years of watching the skies, you finally saw something to brag about!\" \"I won't be bragging,\" Art said. \"I don't want a bunch of alien hunters running around in my yard!\" Zach felt a twinge of concern. \"I knew that you'd been watching the skies at night,\" he told Uncle Art, \"but were people making fun of you for it?\" The old man didn't say anything for a second. He just stared thoughtfully, chewing his stew, looking proud and even a little brave. \"You can't let other people tell you what to believe,\" he said firmly. That night Zach and Larry slept in their sleeping bags in Uncle Art's trailer, and when the sun came up, they rushed to where they'd seen the flying saucer. The desert sand was firm, packed down by years of heat and rain. It was easy to see where the blast of dust had come from - a round circle where the sand was mashed down, right in the spot where they'd scene the flying saucer. But there was something else in the sand. \"Tire tracks!\" From the mashed-down sand led a trail of two parallel lines, each line nearly one foot wide, like the treads of a bulldozer. They followed the trailer, but it joined a dirt road that soon led to the highway. \"It sure is dusty here,\" Zach said. \"Look at me! I'm a spaceship!\" He jumped on the ground, and a cloud of dust billowed up around him. He even jokingly tried to make the weird humming noise the spaceship made last night. \"Oo-oo-oo...\" Larry told him that sounded even worse than his singing. When Zach and Larry returned to the trailer, Uncle Art had a concerned look on his face. Even Zach wondered what he was worrying about, and his uncle decided to share a secret. \"Today in the mail I got a strange letter. It's postmarked from Santa Fe, from a TV station. It says 'Please call us to discuss yesterday's flying starcraft.'\" Uncle Art looked genuinely puzzled. \"I've never said I was an expert on aliens!\" \"Are you sure you didn't call them?\" said Lester, from inside the trailer. \"Maybe you want to be a big-shot!\" Lester had been visiting Art when the mailman brought the letter. \"Or maybe it's you who wants to be a big shot,\" Uncle Art replied. \"Some extra publicity certainly would help your gift shop attract more customers!\" \"Or maybe Zach phoned the TV station,\" Larry interrupted. \"You've pestered me for days about the existence of flying saucers, ever since we started driving for New Mexico!\" The four stared bitterly at each other, but finally Larry spoke up in a voice that was calm and certain. \"This letter didn't come from the TV station,\" Larry announced. \"First of all, it is not on letterhead. More importantly, a TV station would call not write a letter about news.” \"I'm beginning to think we didn't see aliens from space,\" Zach admitted. \"We just saw a particularly elaborate practical joke that someone set up in advance!\" \"If you could make a cloud of dust just jumping on the desert,\" Larry said, \"Imagine how much dust you could kick up dropping a fake 'spaceship' on the ground.\" \"But who?” Zach asked. \"Don't worry,\" Larry announced. \"I know exactly who's responsible.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Dora; (b) Lester; (c) Uncle Art; (d) Zach",
      "answer": "(a) Dora",
      "outcome": "\"Do you really think Uncle Art sent the letter?” Zach asked.\n\"No,\" Larry said. \"Uncle Art didn't want alien hunters in his yard, so he'd never manufacture a fake flying saucer to bring them here!\"\n\"Your smart friend Zach must've set this up,\" Lester shouted, \"so you'd be sure to see a spaceship!\"\n\"That's what I suspected,\" Larry admitted. \"But Zach doesn't even know what street his uncle lives on. So he couldn't write Art's address on this letter!\"\n\"Saved by my own stupidity!” Zach cheered. \"Maybe Lester is our practical joker.\"\n\"He's certainly a joker,\" Larry said. \"But he was in Italy all of last week. He couldn't have sent the letter, since it was postmarked from Santa Fe!\"\n\"But there's an even bigger clue in the letter,\" Larry continued. \"Notice that it asks Art to call the station about 'flying starcraft'. Those aren't the words that most people would use to describe flying saucers. In fact, I've only heard one other person use the phrase 'flying starcraft'.\"\n\"Dora!\" shouted Lester.\nUncle Art seemed hurt, and didn't want to believe that he'd been tricked by his own neighbor. Larry took a deep breath, before delivering the final clue.\n\"A spaceship wouldn't leave tread marks in the ground of the desert. But a crane might. The kind of crane that could lift a fake spaceship.\"\n\"We even heard a truck driving down the freeway right after the 'spaceship' left!” Zach said.\n\"And there's only one suspect that has access to cranes,\" Larry pointed out.\n\"Dora,\" said Zach. \"Her husband has a construction business.\"\n\"I told you she'd been hurting for business,\" said Lester.\n\"She must've been more desperate than any of us knew,\" sighed Uncle Art.\n\"Only a crane could lift a spaceship off the ground,\" Larry said. \"Then they just then cut the lights before heading onto the highway.\"\n\"But in a way, you should be proud, Uncle Art,\" said Zach. \"Because it turns out you've been right all along.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" asked uncle Art.\n\"Never let other people tell you what to believe!\"\nTheir laughed rippled through the trailer, and out into the New Mexico night."
