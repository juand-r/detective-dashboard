    "full_text": "Christmas Eve in the home of Leonard and Marie Hadley was the highlight of the year for the Hadley grandchildren. Leonard and Marie hosted the family Christmas Eve get together for many years. It pleased them greatly to continue on the tradition with grandchildren now in attendance. Marie always felt that children brought a unique meaning and magic to the Christmas season and she shared their enthusiasm for this very special night. Perhaps what everyone in the family loved so much about Christmas Eve at Grandmom Marie’s house were her simple decorations. A couple of stockings hung by the fireplace, a few candles arranged on the dining room chest and a small Christmas tree set up on a formal living room desk table included all of Marie’s decorations. It was enough. Good food and family fellowship supplied the largest part of the mood and atmosphere. On Marie’s small tree was a glassine ornament. This ornament was well over 100 years old and was in the shape of a small house. Marie was a doting, lenient grandmother but she had one hard and fast rule: Look, but do not touch, Granddad Hadley’s antique ornament. Marie placed the glassine figure near the top of the tree so the younger children would not be tempted to touch it. But, children will be children … Grandmom Hadley had, in recent years, decided that the family would eat out on Christmas Eve. It was a big family, as it consisted of the three Hadley sons, their wives and seven grandchildren. This Christmas, after meeting at the grandparent’s house, the family left to dine at a nice restaurant downtown, in a room which was reserved early in the summer. Marie took a quick admiring glance at the glassine figure as she walked out the door to go downtown. After returning home, the adults settled in to seats on the sofa or chairs and the unwrapping of gifts began. For the children, this was the most important time of the celebrating, surpassed only by Santa’s visit early the next morning. This year, it was Mike’s turn to pass out the Christmas gifts, which were placed in a huge pile underneath the table holding the small Christmas tree. A huge pile it was, as there were gifts for Leonard and Marie, plus all the gifts for the three sets of families. Mike was 9 years old, of average height and slightly chubby. He passed out the gifts one by one and felt very grown up as he did so. Marie thought to herself that Mike looked very childlike at this moment, on his knees underneath the tree and distributing the gifts as quickly as possible. Mike would stay in this position until all gifts were unwrapped. His brother, Lennie, was the first to receive a gift. Lennie was five years older, slender and almost six feet tall. He took the gift from his brother with his long, outstretched arm and mumbled, “Thanks.” Cousin Crosby was the oldest of the group by several years. At age 19, he was also the most mature, and his cousins and little brother, Tommy, considered him a near adult. Crosby sat in a chair several feet from the tree and let Mike bring his first gift to him, (which he accomplished by sliding over the carpet on his knees). Crosby would stay in his chair during the unwrapping of gifts, as the living room quickly filled with wrapping paper and excitement. Next, 9-year-old Sandy and Jackie received a few gifts. Sandy took them from Mike and passed Jackie’s to her. Jackie did not feel well and sat by her mother, Mike’s Aunt Pat, and infant brother, George, the entire night. Granddad Hadley felt it a shame that an 8-year-old girl should have to feel poorly on Christmas Eve. Next was Tommy Hadley, Crosby’s 10-year-old brother. Tommy had waited long enough and grabbed his first gift from Mike’s hand. He quickly realized his mistake and mumbled apologies. Mike scarcely heard them because the room was now filled with noise, activity and excitement. The remaining gifts were dispersed quickly and soon the grandparents, aunts and uncles were opening their gifts as enthusiastically as the children were. Lennie joined his brother on the floor, both of them near the table on their knees unwrapping gifts at a lightning pace. Lennie and Mike’s mother, Edith, worried that her sons would wear the knees out of their pants. Tommy seemed glued to the floor, opening and intensely studying his gifts. Sandy stayed with Jackie and they opened their gifts together. Soothing her little brother, George, seemed to perk Jackie up. It took barely 15 minutes for the family to open all of the packages. The living room floor was piled high with wrapping paper and ribbon. After the room quieted and everyone had sat down to examine their gifts, Marie looked up at the tree and noticed the glassine ornament missing. She said, simply and to all, “The glass house is missing.” All eyes turned toward the small Christmas tree. Nobody said anything. Granddad chimed in, “Perhaps it fell.” After a careful inspection of the cluttered floor, the whereabouts of the missing glass house became a serious issue. Sharp-eyed Marie did not see the act, one of the few things she had missed on this Christmas Eve. Still, she had a pretty good idea of who took it. It was one of the grandchildren, as none of the adults had been near the tree since returning home from the restaurant. She decided to play a bluff. Looking at the one whom she considered to be guilty, she asked, “Why did you take it?” Her guess was right. The guilty grandchild said, very quietly, “I just wanted to take it home and study it. You never let us take it off the tree. I was going to give it back.” The room remained quiet for a long Christmas moment. The grandchild finally asked, “How did you know I took it?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWhere was the ornament?  \n   – On a very small Christmas tree that itself was standing on a desk-top.  \n   – Grand-mom hung it “near the top” so that the *little* children could not reach it.\n\n2.\tWho was ever close enough to touch it after the family came back from the restaurant?  \n   •  Mike – 9, average height, but he spent the whole time *on his knees* underneath the table that held the tree, handing out parcels. In that position he simply could not reach the ornament  five feet or more above the floor.  \n   •  Lennie – 14, “almost six feet tall,” with “a long, out-stretched arm”; after receiving his first present he knelt beside Mike and stayed in front of the table while he opened all his gifts. Even kneeling, his shoulders would still be roughly four feet from the floor and, with one quick reach upward, he could touch the ornament easily without standing.  \n   •  Tommy – 10, sat on the floor but there is no indication that he was right next to the tree, and at his age/height he would still have had to stand up on tip-toe and stretch – something an adult in the room would have noticed.  \n   •  Crosby – 19, tall enough, but he “stayed in his chair several feet from the tree” the whole time.  \n   •  Sandy (9) and Jackie (8) – stayed with Jackie’s mother across the room; they could not have reached the tree at all.\n\n3.\tGrand-mom’s silent reasoning  \n   •  Only one grandchild satisfied both requirements: (a) close enough and (b) tall enough. That was Lennie.  \n   •  Crosby was tall but never moved; everyone else was too short.  \n   •  Therefore she simply looked straight at Lennie and bluffed, “Why did you take it?”\n\n4.\tThe confession  \n   •  The child she looked at admitted the deed at once – proving her deduction correct.\n\n5.\tMotive stated by the culprit  \n   – “I just wanted to take it home and study it. You never let us take it off the tree.”  \n   – That is a perfectly believable remark from a curious 14-year-old who is half-adult and fascinated by a 100-year-old object.\n\nHence Lennie is the only person who had motive, opportunity and the physical ability to remove the glass house unseen.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMike Hadley, Lennie Hadley, Crosby Hadley, Tommy Hadley, Sandy (surname Hadley not given), Jackie (surname not given)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nLennie Hadley\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen the family returned from dinner, the presents were piled under the small table that supported the miniature tree.  \nMike crawled beneath the table to act as gift-distributor. Lennie, tall and long-armed, knelt close by, waiting for his turn. While everyone’s attention was on the passing of parcels and the general hub-bub, Lennie raised one hand, plucked the delicate glass house from an upper branch, and slipped it into a pocket. A moment later he settled on his knees and began opening gifts at high speed beside his brother. Nobody noticed anything unusual.  \nFifteen minutes later, after the wrapping paper whirlwind subsided, Grand-mom glanced at the tree and saw the empty spot. Realising that no adult had gone near it and recalling that only a tall child directly in front of the tree could have reached the ornament, she fixed her eyes on Lennie and asked a direct question. Lennie, caught by the accurate accusation, confessed immediately, explaining he only wanted to examine the antique more closely and would have returned it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMike – Close to the tree but on his knees the entire time; from that position he could not reach an ornament hanging near the top of a tree that was itself standing on a desk.  \nCrosby – Tall enough, yet he never left his chair several feet away.  \nTommy – Sat on the floor but not right beside the tree and was too short to reach the ornament without standing up, something everyone would have seen.  \nSandy and Jackie – Both girls stayed across the room with Jackie’s mother; they never approached the tree and were also too short to reach it in any case.  \nTherefore none of them had both the opportunity and the physical ability that Lennie possessed.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Grandmom Marie began to speak. Gently, she said, “First, I believe you when you say you would return it. But, there is a reason we do not allow it to be taken off of the tree. It is very old and fragile and dates from the post Civil War era. In the future, Granddad and I will allow it to be studied on the kitchen table with one of us supervising. But, to answer your question, I studied the family as we opened our gifts.

It wasn’t any of the adults. After returning from dinner, we all sat down and were never near the tree. I knew it could not be Mike. He was on the floor the entire time we were unwrapping gifts. He is not tall enough to reach up and take it. It wasn’t Sandy or Jackie, either. They were together with their parents and baby George, across the room from the tree.”\nMarie paused to take a deep breath. She was about to prove a grandson guilty of disobeying a strict family rule and this distressed her. Finally, she continued, “It wasn’t Tommy, either. He sat on the floor the entire time, unwrapping and studying his gifts.”\nShe let this soak in. She looked again at Lennie and said, “It had to be you. Not only could it not have been anyone else, but you were close to the tree with Mike. Even though you were on your knees, with your height and long arms, it took little effort for you to quickly snatch the glass house when nobody was looking.”\nMarie resumed. In a gentle voice, she told Lennie, “Your parents can discuss this with you when you go home. You gave in to the temptation of the moment so Granddad and I forgive you.” With emotion and with a tear in her eye, she finished by saying, “Tomorrow is Christmas and we celebrate the birth of the one who accepts far greater guilt than yours. So, to you and our entire family, Merry Christmas and may our Lord’s grace be with us all.”",

She was about to prove a grandson guilty of disobeying a strict family rule and this distressed her. Finally, she continued, “It wasn’t Tommy, either. He sat on the floor the entire time, unwrapping and studying his gifts.”\nShe let this soak in. She looked again at Lennie and said, “It had to be you. Not only could it not have been anyone else, but you were close to the tree with Mike. Even though you were on your knees, with your height and long arms, it took little effort for you to quickly snatch the glass house when nobody was looking.”\nMarie resumed. In a gentle voice, she told Lennie, “Your parents can discuss this with you when you go home. You gave in to the temptation of the moment so Granddad and I forgive you.” With emotion and with a tear in her eye, she finished by saying, “Tomorrow is Christmas and we celebrate the birth of the one who accepts far greater guilt than yours. So, to you and our entire family, Merry Christmas and may our Lord’s grace be with us all.”"
