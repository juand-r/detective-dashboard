    "full_text": "Looking like he'd just stepped off the pages of a glossy men's magazine feature on the World's Most Successful Executives, Cameron Carlyle got out of the cab and retrieved his credit card from the driver. He strode into the tiny office of Joe's Garage. Joe wiped his hands on the rag hanging out of his pocket and extended his hand. Instead of shaking Joe's hand, Cameron Carlyle just handed him his platinum card. \"Am I buying you a dinghy or a yacht today?\" \"Neither. We couldn't find anything wrong with your Beamer.\" \"I come here instead of the dealership because you usually keep that Beamer purring like a kitten, Joe.\" \"Fingers Ferguson is my best mechanic, but the kind of problem you described often occurs only on a cold start. Why don't you leave the Beamer overnight so we can check it again first thing in the morning before anybody's driven it?\" \"I've got special plans tonight. Meghan thinks we're just going out to celebrate her birthday, but I'm going to propose.\" \"My wife's birthday was last week. I used her birthstone for her engagement ring too.\" Joe reached into his deep overall pocket to retrieve the keys and handed them to Cameron Carlyle. Moments later, Cameron Carlyle charged back into the office. His face was as red as the rag Joe took out of his overall pocket to wipe peanut butter and jelly off his hands. \"Meghan's ring is missing! I forgot it was in the glove compartment when I dropped off the car this morning.\" \"I always try to check vehicles for valuables before anybody starts working on them, but we were pretty busy this morning. Let's call the police so they can file a report for your insurance company.\" Detective Riley Burke walked into the tiny garage office and smiled when he noticed a familiar smell he remembered from all those years of walking a beat in this neighborhood before earning his gold shield. \"You guys obviously celebrated pay day with ribs from Eli's.\" \"Some of us did,\" Fingers replied pointing to the partially eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwich on Joe's cluttered desk. \"Since when do you eat peanut butter and jelly, Joe?\" \"Since my youngest's ex walked out on him and Molly and I wound up raising three grandsons.\" \"The dispatcher says you reported a stolen engagement ring. Don't you still put valuables you find in the safe?\" \"I always try to check cars for valuables but we were so busy this morning that I might not have gotten around to it.\" \"Mr. Carlyle. Could you please describe the ring for me?\" \"The ring is a designer original four carat emerald cut amethyst with diamonds set into the platinum band.\" \"Insured?\" \"Of course it's insured, Detective. That's not going to help me propose on Meghan's birthday tonight!\" \"Please have one of your assistants bring over a copy of the insurance appraisal and a photo as soon as possible.\" \"Certainly.\" Cameron Carlyle pulled out his cell phone, but almost got toppled over when the office door burst open. \"Sorry! I was in such a hurry to get to my second job that I didn't look to see if there was anybody in the way.‚Äù Joe Morgan reached for one of the sets of keys on the pegboard and handed them to the flustered schoolteacher. \"You can pay the bill next month, Mr. Bridges.\" \"Thanks for understanding, Joe. And thanks for keeping my bucket of bolts running until I can afford to buy something better.\" \"Quick question before you go, Mr. Bridges. Did you happen to notice the Beamer when you dropped your car off this morning?\" \"Kind of hard not to notice a vehicle that costs more than my condo, Detective. If it had been unlocked, I must confess I probably would have taken advantage of the opportunity to see what it feels like to sit a poor teacher's thrift store suit on the finest leather money can buy.\" Detective Burke walked over to where Fingers Ferguson was leaning against the wall. \"A ring like that must have been pretty tempting to somebody with your special talents.\" \"Never laid eyes on it, Detective. Wouldn't have mattered if it had fallen into my lap. Check the records downtown. I haven't gotten so much as a parking ticket since I met my wife.\" Fingers Ferguson, who'd earned his nickname picking the pockets of high rollers in Vegas before coming back to his hometown and settling down to marry the minister's daughter, grumbled under his breath that his boss might have been tempted to pocket the ring since too many of the garage customers were paying on the installment plan or not paying at all lately. The other mechanic shared his theory too. \"Maybe the high and mighty CEO of Carlyle Industries never left that ring in the car at all. He was probably trying to pull a fast one on his insurance company to help make up for the dismal quarterly report that showed profits were down almost 75%.\" When he started working at the garage, Manuel Garcia could barely read enough English to find the right oil filters and air filters for the cars he worked on. Now, he was eagerly reading the Wall Street Journals he found in the trash when he cleaned offices at night to help support his family. \"Son, that quarterly report is just snapshot of what was happening at a specific moment. It can't possibly show the whole picture like how my recent cost cutting moves and diversification of the product line are really beginning to pay off. You'll see a huge positive change next quarter.\" Cameron Carlyle handed Manuel a card. \"You might want to touch base with our Human Resources Manager. I'm sure we could find a spot for a smart young man like you.\" Detective Burke smiled when Manuel handed the card back. \"I heard you've been accepted for the next class at the Police Academy.\" \"Yessir. I want to reach out to the kids like me who could wind up joining a gang if they don't get lucky enough to have somebody steer them in a better direction.\" \"Rookie cops don't earn much. Might be nice to come into a windfall to tuck away for a rainy day.\" \"I spent the whole day working on the teacher's jalopy and a pool guy's pickup. Never touched the Beamer.\" \"Sounds like everybody here is as innocent as a newborn infant. This could be a long night. Wish I'd gotten here in time to share some of Eli's ribs.\" Cameron Carlyle suddenly smiled. \"Detective, I just remembered something that might solve this mystery.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who really had a reason to grab a four-carat designer amethyst ring?\n   ‚Ä¢ Cameron Carlyle ‚Äì would profit from an insurance claim, but if he really wanted to cheat the insurer he would have had to give up proposing that very night.  Everything he says ‚Äì a birthday dinner and a surprise proposal ‚Äì depends on still having the ring in his hand by 7 o‚Äôclock.  Faking a theft therefore destroys his own plan.  Cheating the insurer makes no sense for him tonight.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Mr. Bridges ‚Äì a chronically-broke school-teacher, but he was never in possession of the Beamer‚Äôs keys.  He says the car was locked, so unless he is a lock-picker he had no chance.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Manuel Garcia ‚Äì studying for Police Academy, openly proud of having a clean record and of his future badge.  A theft today would ruin the one thing he is working for.  No motive that fits his character arc.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Fingers Ferguson ‚Äì a reformed pick-pocket, but the whole purpose of his ‚Äúgood-guy‚Äù back-story is to make him an obvious red herring.  He also had a big barbecue lunch (Eli‚Äôs ribs) with the rest of the crew, so he was away from the garage for a while.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Joe Morgan ‚Äì the owner.  He has three grand-children to raise, his customers are slow in paying, and he openly admires amethyst rings (his wife‚Äôs engagement ring is also an amethyst).  Money is tight and temptation is high.\n\n2. Who had ample unfettered access to Carlyle‚Äôs car?\n   ‚Ä¢ Only the garage staff ‚Äì Joe, Fingers, and Manuel ‚Äì had keys and legitimate reason to be inside the Beamer.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Bridges never had a key; Carlyle dropped the car off before Bridges arrived.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Carlyle himself never touched the car after the morning drop-off until the moment he discovered the loss, so he could not have removed the ring during the day.\n\n3. Physical clues that point at Joe.\n   ‚Ä¢ When Carlyle first appears, Joe has a rag sticking out of the same deep overall pocket from which he later produces the car keys.  At the moment Carlyle discovers the loss, Joe again pulls that rag ‚Äì now smeared with the reddish-purple jelly of his sandwich ‚Äì out of the same pocket.  A purple-stone ring wrapped in that rag would not shine through the jelly smears and would explain why the rag‚Äôs bulge goes unnoticed.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Detective Burke asks, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you still put valuables you find in the safe?‚Äù  A completely innocent man would answer either ‚ÄúYes, I did‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo, I never saw any valuables.‚Äù  Joe gives a slippery answer (‚ÄúWe were pretty busy this morning; I might not have gotten around to it‚Äù), which fits neither of those two honest possibilities.  He is deliberately avoiding saying, ‚ÄúNo, I never looked,‚Äù because in fact he did look and he pocketed the ring.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Joe‚Äôs motive is underlined twice: (1) the financial strain of raising three grandsons, and (2) the fact that his wife‚Äôs own ring is an amethyst, making Carlyle‚Äôs ring personally attractive.\n\n4. The last-second memory that ‚Äúmight solve this mystery.‚Äù\n   Carlyle suddenly remembers Joe‚Äôs earlier boast that he ‚Äúalways checks cars for valuables‚Äù and puts them in the safe.  That jogs the executive‚Äôs mind: the ring must still be somewhere in the garage, and only Joe could have moved it.  In other words, the very memory that supposedly solves the case points the finger straight at Joe.\n\n5. Logical deduction\n   ‚Ä¢ Only the garage staff had real opportunity.  \n   ‚Ä¢ Of the staff, only Joe shows both temptation (financial pressure, love of amethyst) and evasive answers.  \n   ‚Ä¢ The physical rag already in his pocket is the perfect short-term hiding place.  \n   Therefore Joe Morgan is the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCameron Carlyle, Joe Morgan, ‚ÄúFingers‚Äù Ferguson, Manuel Garcia, Mr. Bridges\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nJoe Morgan\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n‚Ä¢ Morning:  Cameron Carlyle drops off his BMW, forgetting that the amethyst engagement ring is in the unlocked glove compartment.  \n‚Ä¢ Joe Morgan does his customary sweep of the interior.  He finds the valuable ring, tells himself he will ‚Äúkeep it safe,‚Äù but the temptation of a four-carat stone and his own money worries get the better of him.  \n‚Ä¢ Instead of walking to the office safe, he wraps the ring in the greasy rag already stuffed in his deep overall pocket.  He intends to decide later whether to return it or keep it.  \n‚Ä¢ All day the rag ‚Äì now also used to wipe peanut-butter-and-jelly off his hands ‚Äì stays in that pocket.  \n‚Ä¢ Late afternoon: Carlyle arrives, is handed the car keys, and discovers the ring missing.  \n‚Ä¢ Joe pretends surprise and suggests calling the police, gambling that no one will think to search his pocket.  \n‚Ä¢ Detective Burke arrives.  When asked if he still puts valuables in the safe, Joe can‚Äôt give a straight answer without incriminating himself, so he stalls with ‚ÄúWe were pretty busy this morning.‚Äù  \n‚Ä¢ While everyone else is being questioned, the ring remains hidden in Joe‚Äôs rag-stuffed pocket.  \n‚Ä¢ Carlyle suddenly remembers Joe‚Äôs boast about always safeguarding valuables, realizes the only logical place the ring can be is in Joe‚Äôs possession, and points the investigation in that direction.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n‚Ä¢ Cameron Carlyle ‚Äì Needs the ring tonight for his proposal; a fake insurance claim would sabotage his own plans.  He had no chance to remove the ring after he left the car.  \n‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúFingers‚Äù Ferguson ‚Äì A convenient red herring with a criminal past, but he was out to lunch for a good part of the time, had no pressing monetary need, and nothing in his behavior was evasive.  \n‚Ä¢ Manuel Garcia ‚Äì About to enter the Police Academy; stealing now would defeat his own dream.  He worked on other vehicles, not the BMW.  \n‚Ä¢ Mr. Bridges ‚Äì Never had the Beamer‚Äôs keys; says the car was locked.  Even if he were tempted, he lacked the opportunity and the expertise to get inside.  \nAll of them can be accounted for or lack a rational motive, whereas Joe Morgan alone fits motive, means, opportunity, and the telling evasions.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I haven't gotten so much as a parking ticket since I met my wife.\" Fingers Ferguson, who'd earned his nickname picking the pockets of high rollers in Vegas before coming back to his hometown and settling down to marry the minister's daughter, grumbled under his breath that his boss might have been tempted to pocket the ring since too many of the garage customers were paying on the installment plan or not paying at all lately. The other mechanic shared his theory too. \"Maybe the high and mighty CEO of Carlyle Industries never left that ring in the car at all. He was probably trying to pull a fast one on his insurance company to help make up for the dismal quarterly report that showed profits were down almost 75%.\" When he started working at the garage, Manuel Garcia could barely read enough English to find the right oil filters and air filters for the cars he worked on. Now, he was eagerly reading the Wall Street Journals he found in the trash when he cleaned offices at night to help support his family. \"Son, that quarterly report is just snapshot of what was happening at a specific moment. It can't possibly show the whole picture like how my recent cost cutting moves and diversification of the product line are really beginning to pay off. You'll see a huge positive change next quarter.\" Cameron Carlyle handed Manuel a card. \"You might want to touch base with our Human Resources Manager. I'm sure we could find a spot for a smart young man like you.\" Detective Burke smiled when Manuel handed the card back. \"I heard you've been accepted for the next class at the Police Academy.\" \"Yessir. I want to reach out to the kids like me who could wind up joining a gang if they don't get lucky enough to have somebody steer them in a better direction.\" \"Rookie cops don't earn much. Might be nice to come into a windfall to tuck away for a rainy day.\" \"I spent the whole day working on the teacher's jalopy and a pool guy's pickup. Never touched the Beamer.\" \"Sounds like everybody here is as innocent as a newborn infant. This could be a long night. Wish I'd gotten here in time to share some of Eli's ribs.\" Cameron Carlyle suddenly smiled. \"Detective, I just remembered something that might solve this mystery.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Fingers Ferguson; (b) Joe Morgan; (c) Manuel Garcia; (d) Mr. Bridges",
      "answer": "(b) Joe Morgan",
      "outcome": "Cameron Carlyle told Detective Burke that there were four possible suspects. Mr. Bridges could not have taken the ring because the car was locked so he had no access to the ring. Thus, he is innocent. What about Manuel Garcia? Well, he spent the day working on other vehicles. Since he never touched the Beamer, he too would have had no access to the ring. He has to be innocent, also.\nAs for Fingers Ferguson, he turned over a new leaf when he returned to his hometown and married the minister's daughter. He was telling the truth when he told Detective Burke, \"I haven't gotten so much as a parking ticket since I met my wife.\" Yes, Ferguson is innocent, too.\nThere was more than a red rag and keys in the overworked and financially strapped mechanic's deep pocket. The ring was there too! He also commented that he'd used his wife's birthstone for her engagement ring too ‚Ä¶ before Carlyle described the missing ring."
