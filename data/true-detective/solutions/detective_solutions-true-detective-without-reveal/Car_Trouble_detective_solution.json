    "full_text": "Who did this? I asked myself, not believing what was in front of me. I had arrived at my psychology office at ten this morning, as usual. Then, I walked across the road to the local coffee shop, had a latte and half an hour later headed back to the office. That’s when I saw my slashed tires. I was shocked! The fact that four tires had been cut instead of just one indicated that it wasn’t just a prank by some kids in the neighborhood. It was obviously done by someone who had issues with me. Immediately, I narrowed it down to four possibilities. They were my “red-zone” patients -- ones that I had not yet been able to help. I dashed into my office, dug up their files and asked my secretary, Renata, to try and schedule all of them for today. Then I had her phone the Auto Club about my car. I decided I would speak to each of the patients and attempt to figure out the culprit. However, I knew that I couldn’t merely ask them about the incident -- some might react badly. I would have to watch for subtle clues. I only had to wait a few moments before Renata buzzed to let me know that Mrs. Roberts had arrived. The door to my office opened and in she trotted. She was blonde and weighed far too much for her small frame. We had been trying to discover the psychological reasons for her compulsive over-eating but so far no luck. “Hello, Mrs. Roberts, how’s everything going?” “Not very well,” she said, pointing a chubby finger at me. “Your suggestions don’t seem to work at all.” “I see. You blame me?” “You know what I’ve lost so far? Three pounds. I still can’t bend down to kiss my kids. How am I going to go to that wedding next week looking like this?” “Mrs. Roberts, rather than being so upset, you should congratulate yourself on your success.” She grimaced. “What success? It’s only three pounds.” “Yes that’s true. But many of my patients would be thrilled they lost anything. Most of them are gaining by the week.” She paused for a moment, seemed to be thinking that over. Suddenly, she sat up a little straighter in her chair, her pale face gaining a bit of color. She seemed a bit more optimistic now and we continued talking about her weight until her hour was up. Then I asked Renata to send in the next patient. Randy Peters stumbled in and cautiously walked towards the chair in front of my desk. “What’s wrong Mr. Peters?” “Lost my contacts, doc. Don’t know where I put them.” He felt for the chair and sat down. “Be careful, Mr. Peters. That’s dangerous.” “Yes, I know. I’m taking a taxi home.” “Good.” I nodded. “I was curious how everything is going?” “Not very well.” “You told me last week that you were having more frequent dreams.” He nodded. “Yesterday was the worst. The man in the mask chased me down the street. But I finally stood up to him and ripped his mask off.” “Was the face familiar to you?” “Now that you mention it he may have looked a bit like you, doc.” “Like me? What do you think that means?” He shrugged. “I don’t know. But it upset me a great deal to see you staring at me.” He gestured with his hand and knocked over my penholder. “Sorry doc.” He quickly picked up all the pens and dropped them back into the holder. Suddenly, he smiled. “I got it, Doc. You remind me of my dad and I never got along with him. That’s why I must have gotten upset when I saw you in the dream.” I was happy we had made some progress in his therapy. We continued talking more about his father until it was time for my next patient. Mr. Carlson entered my office and grimaced as he looked down at the chair in front of him. “Is it okay if I stand doctor?” “Yes, that’s fine.” Mr. Carlson had a phobia about germs and it seemed to be getting worse. “How are things going?” “Not well. Today, I couldn’t even touch my computer at work.” “Did you try the affirmations like we did with some of your other obsessions?” “It didn’t do any good. In fact, I got so upset, I wanted to take it out on somebody.” He stared at me. “Did anything unusual happen to you the week before this started?” He started to lean against the wall, but then looked at it and moved away. “Well last week, I accidentally locked myself in the garage. It was very messy and I was stuck there for hours.” I smiled. “We may have hit on something, Mr. Carlson. We continued to talk about his issues and I finally got him to sit in the chair. At the end of the session, Renata sent in my last “red-zone” patient. Mr. Leamington ambled in smoking a cigarette, even though the reason he had come to see me originally was that he wanted to quit smoking. “I thought we agreed that you wouldn’t smoke in here, Mr. Leamington.” “I’m sorry,” He said. “It’s just I couldn’t control myself. It seems as if my hands have a mind of their own. I understand,” I said. “What thought comes into your mind, just before you pull out the cigarette?” “Nothing, doctor.” “I know you think there’s nothing. But every action has a thought that precedes it. Okay, what time did you start smoking this morning?” “I started as soon as I got up -- about twelve. I do shift-work.” “Okay, now go back in your mind. You have just awoken. What are you thinking?” He closed his eyes for a moment then opened them quickly. “I’m thinking about my girlfriend dumping me. It made me mad.” “So perhaps you felt that the cigarette would help you feel better. Is that correct?” He thought again. “Yes, I think you’re right.” “Good work, I think we’re onto something.” He smiled broadly. I gave Mr. Leamington some other tactics he could try then ended the session. After he left, I tried to figure out which of my patients had slashed my tires.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Scene & time-frame  \n   • The tyres were cut between 10:00 and about 10:30 a.m., the half–hour in which the doctor crossed the street for coffee.  \n   • Whoever did it had to be near the office at that hour and willing to crouch beside four filthy wheels and work with a knife.\n\n2. What the interviews tell us  \n\n   Mrs Roberts  \n   – Complains but is quickly encouraged; her main problem is that she “still can’t bend down to kiss my kids.”  \n   – Slashing four tyres means repeated bending and kneeling – exactly the movement she says she cannot do.  \n   – Motive exists (frustration), but her own words supply the physical alibi.\n\n   Randy Peters  \n   – Arrives almost blind, having “lost my contacts.”  \n   – Says he will have to take a taxi home – so he was already moving around the city without driving.  \n   – Violent dream in which a masked man (who finally looks like the doctor) is chased and unmasked; admits the scene upset him badly.  \n   – Knocks over the pen-holder because he cannot see well; in picking the pens up we learn he was crouching and groping on the floor – exactly the body-position that would make one’s hard lenses pop out.  \n   – Most telling: the contacts disappeared the very morning of the vandalism; he almost certainly lost them while crouching at the doctor’s car.\n\n   Mr Carlson  \n   – Acute germ-phobia.  That morning he “couldn’t even touch my computer at work” and refused at first to sit on a perfectly clean chair.  \n   – He might be angry, but the last thing a mysophobe would do is put his hands on grime-covered tyres.\n\n   Mr Leamington  \n   – Shift worker; woke up at “about twelve.”  At 10–10:30 a.m. he was asleep.  \n   – No reason to lie: he smokes openly in the office and admits every lapse; his time-line clears him.\n\n3. Opportunity & physical evidence  \n   – Only Randy came to the office blind and without a car, consistent with having already lost his lenses and made himself dependent on taxis.  \n   – Losing both contact lenses is rare unless you are bent low over rough ground or gravel – exactly what happens when you hack at tyres.  \n   – The other three either could not physically perform the act (Roberts), would not touch filthy rubber (Carlson) or were not awake (Leamington).\n\n4. Motive  \n   – Randy’s recurring nightmare puts the doctor in the role of the masked aggressor; anger toward the doctor is explicit.  \n   – He even says that seeing the doctor’s face in the dream “upset me a great deal,” a powerful, recent emotional trigger.\n\n5. Deduction  \n   Combining motive (violent transference onto the doctor), opportunity (present near the office at the right time), and the only piece of physical evidence (the disappearance of his contact lenses) singles out Randy Peters.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMrs. Diane Roberts, Randy Peters, Mr. (Richard) Carlson, Mr. (Howard) Leamington, Renata (secretary)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nRandy Peters\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAt about 9:55 a.m. Randy Peters arrived well in advance of his appointment, seething over the violent dream in which the doctor’s face had appeared behind the pursuer’s mask.  \nSeeing the doctor leave for coffee, the resentment boiled over.  He took a small knife (kept in his pocket as a letter-opener) and, kneeling beside the car, slashed each of the four tyres.  During the crouching and arm movement his contact lenses were shaken out; groping for them on the gritty pavement he failed to find them.  \nHalf-blind, he then entered the building, told Renata he had lost his lenses, and waited for his session.  Because he now had no means to drive, he intended from the outset to “take a taxi home.”  The doctor found the ruined tyres minutes later.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mrs. Roberts – Her own complaint that she “still can’t bend down” makes the repeated crouching necessary to slash four tyres virtually impossible.  She also had no known reason to be near the office that early.  \n\n• Mr. Carlson – His crippling germ-phobia kept him from touching even a chair; dirty automobile tyres would be far beyond his tolerance.  \n\n• Mr. Leamington – States (with no motive to lie) that he was asleep until noon because of shift work; this places him nowhere near the scene at 10:00 a.m.  \n\n• Renata – Remained at her desk; the doctor saw and spoke with her immediately on returning, so she had no time to leave the building, vandalise the car, and get back unseen.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

    "reveal_text": "My first thought was that it might be Mrs. Roberts. She seemed to blame me for her lack of success in weight management. However, she also said she couldn’t bend. That would mean she wouldn’t have been able to slash the tires. It’s not Mrs. Johnson.\nNext, I figured it could be Mr. Carlson. He was unhappy because I hadn’t been able to help get rid of his phobia. However, he’s so worried about germs that he would never go near my dusty Dodge. It’s not Mr. Carlson.\nCould it be Mr. Leamington? He was angry and said sometimes his hands have a mind of their own. But my tires were slashed at ten-thirty and Mr. Leamington didn’t get up until twelve. It isn’t this man\nI had originally eliminated Randy Peters. Yes, he was unhappy with my therapy, but he wouldn’t have been able to cut the tires due to his missing contacts. When he knocked over my penholder and was able to quickly put all the pens back, I knew he had been pulling the wool over my eyes and that he could see. It is Randy Peters\nLater I confronted the man. He confessed and agreed that he and I would work together to help him get over his anger reactions.",

Is that correct?” He thought again. “Yes, I think you’re right.” “Good work, I think we’re onto something.” He smiled broadly. I gave Mr. Leamington some other tactics he could try then ended the session. After he left, I tried to figure out which of my patients had slashed my tires.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Mr. Carlson; (b) Mr. Leamington; (c) Mrs. Roberts; (d) Randy Peters",
      "answer": "(d) Randy Peters",
      "outcome": "My first thought was that it might be Mrs. Roberts. She seemed to blame me for her lack of success in weight management. However, she also said she couldn’t bend. That would mean she wouldn’t have been able to slash the tires. It’s not Mrs. Johnson.\nNext, I figured it could be Mr. Carlson. He was unhappy because I hadn’t been able to help get rid of his phobia. However, he’s so worried about germs that he would never go near my dusty Dodge. It’s not Mr. Carlson.\nCould it be Mr. Leamington? He was angry and said sometimes his hands have a mind of their own. But my tires were slashed at ten-thirty and Mr. Leamington didn’t get up until twelve. It isn’t this man\nI had originally eliminated Randy Peters. Yes, he was unhappy with my therapy, but he wouldn’t have been able to cut the tires due to his missing contacts. When he knocked over my penholder and was able to quickly put all the pens back, I knew he had been pulling the wool over my eyes and that he could see. It is Randy Peters\nLater I confronted the man. He confessed and agreed that he and I would work together to help him get over his anger reactions."
