    "full_text": "In this mystery, tension climbs. \nAll the clues are hid in rhymes! It's a holiday delight, \ntelling of a spooky night. In that night, down darkened streets \ntwo children go beg for treats. \"Halloween? We ignore dangers \nand take candy gifts from strangers!\" Mark and his friend Ann did good, \nvisiting their neighborhood. Candies soon would fill their sacks.\nThey should carry home their snacks. Skies were dark, with moonlit clouds,\nbut they'd left the begging crowds. for one last house, though they didn't know\nit's one spot where they shouldn't go. It's a dark house, there, alone\nWinds make its old windows groan. Grass had fled its dirty lawn.\nAll its trees and plants were gone. Silence took their place, and gloom. \nIt's deserted -- like a tomb. \"This is scary,\" Mark told Ann.\n\"Last time I came here, I ran. \"I heard noises, like a ghost.\"\n\"I'm not scared,\" Ann liked to boast. No one was around that night,\nand Mark's heart was filled with fright. Ann dared him to pay a visit.\n\"Hear those noises? Mark, what is it?\" They tiptoed up to the doorstep.\nMark didn't want to take one more step. Strange noises came from inside.\nbut wind made the door swing wide. Darkness loomed, but Ann could spy \na dirty flashlight waiting nearby. With its beam they saw dark hallways.\nWould Ann take the challenge? Always. She grabbed Mark and whispered slow.\n\"Let's see where these dark halls go.\" With each step the floor would creak\nIts old wood began to reek. Dust and strange smells, all around.\nMark tried not to make a sound. Ann's flashlight then beamed the room\nsearching for those sounds of gloom. In her flashlight, she would trust.\nAll it lit were piles of dust. Giant dust balls, inches wide,\nfilled the house's dark inside. It had gathered over chairs,\nin the corners, on the stairs. Ann was curious, not afraid.\nHow was it those sounds were made? In the dark she paused to stare\nat one footprint on the stair. Grey balls bounced against their shoes.\n\"Let's go up and look for clues.\" \"Or we could go home,\" Mark said.\n\"That noise could be someone dead! Are we safe here?\" Ann said no.\n\"Even so, I've got to know.\" Mark would run, but in that night\nAnn still held the only light. From the downstairs dust that reeks\nto the old staircase that creaks,  Ann would move, then stop to stare\nat the pattern on the stair. On each step, a shape she knew: \nDarker outlines of a shoe In the dust, the stairway mounting,\nUp the steps, Mark started counting. It's a trick he used when scared.\nCounting made him feel prepared. \"One, two, three, four -- I see twelve tracks\nOn the staircase.\" Ann said \"Relax.\" Soon her light had scanned the path.\nShe didn't need to fuss with math. Up the stairs she'd quickly run,\ntelling Mark this would be fun. Leaving him to mull her dares,\nAnn had vanished up the stairs And without the flashlight's spark\nMark stood in the silent dark. Questions seemed to cluster 'round.\nWhat had made that creepy sound? Mark said \"Well, this house is old.\" \nBut besides that -- it was cold. Dust brushed up against his feet.\nMaybe he should eat a treat. Then, like horrors when you're dreaming,\nMark heard Ann's voice. It was screaming. Screaming from upstairs, not stopping.\nWith terror, Mark's sweat was dropping. Should he see if Ann was dead,\nOr just count her screams instead? Three, four, five, six, screams were shrieking\nin that house whose floors were reeking. Eight screams, nine screams, they kept coming.\nTen and more -- the noise was numbing. What was in that room she'd lightened?\nWhat could make Ann's voice so frightened? Panicking now to his core, \nMark couldn't find the entry door. Stumbling through dark surrounding\nThere was just one clue -- that sounding. Ann yelled her eleventh scream\nand just like an awful dream Listening to her screaming voice,\nMark knew he had just one choice, One way not to be alone:\nrun to where Ann's flashlight shone. Without thinking, up he ran\ntowards the fourteen screams of Ann. On that second floor that rotted,\nMark discovered what she'd spotted. What was at the stairway's top?\nWhat he saw would make Mark stop, Stare amazed, and wonder, too.\nGaze was all that he could do. In the silent evening black,\nTwo white eyes were staring back. Hovering with its eyebrows spread,\nthey could see, a floating head!!! Just one head, but in the dark,\nits eyes moved from Ann to Mark. Quite alive, its shining face\nstared at them with ghostly grace. Silently it stared, unfrightened.\nMore dust on the floor was brightened by the glowing face, and by it,\nMark noticed Ann became quiet. He looked at her, and fear grew.\nAnn had witnessed something new. In the dark, but coming near them\ntwo more eyes would come to peer them! Down the hallway, bringing dread\nfloated up a second head! It's a woman, face still ghostly\nwearing ancient makeup, mostly. Bizarre rouge on glowing skin,\nTiny lines on eyebrows thin. Scraggly hair was dangling down,\nfrom her forehead, dirty brown. With its white eyes, Ann felt sure, \nIt was looking back at her. Suddenly the silence broke.\nThat white floating head? It spoke. \"Who?\" it asked Ann. \"Who are you?\nCan you hear me? You are new!\" \"Yes,\" the other face replied.\n\"What has made you stray inside?\" In the dark and silent house,\nAnn was quiet as a mouse. \"Speak!\" the face said, angry now.\n\"What has brought us here -- and how?\" Mark knew in that haunted night,\nsilence would be impolite. So he told the ghosts, \"It's late.\nHalloween, 2008. In this house, we found your head\nfloating here. We think you're dead. Maybe there's one day between\nlife and death, on Halloween. When you feel that night begin,\nGhosts can roam the earth again.\" Ann now asked them for a clue.\n\"We're just children. Who are you?\" And the glowing man's face moaned.\nOf an ancient pain he groaned. \"I was once a famous chief\nof an Indian tribe. A thief stole into our camp one night\nand he killed me in a fight.\" Soon his eyelids closed with fears.\nWhite and bloodshot eyes shed tears Then the female head moaned low,\n\"That's a century ago! I was wealthy, filled with kicks\nback in 1846. Till a sickness in the night\nturned my head into this fright.\" When they pondered how they'd died,\nboth the floating heads soon cried.  Through his sobs, the Indian chief\nshared the reason for his grief. \"We shared meadows without guilt\nbefore houses here were built.\" And the wealthy woman thought\nof the joys her life had brought. \"I strolled gaily down the street.\nYou know what I miss? My feet!\" Both heads then looked towards the ground,\nBut no feet there could be found. \"I once wore the poshest clothes,\nled to dances by my beaus. We became such dainty trippers, \nnight and day wore high-heeled slippers.” But now she sighed.\n\"Guess it's true -- I finally died.\" Then the chief remembered fun\nwhen he'd used his legs to run. \"All my life, the sweetest treat?\nFeeling grass on my feet. Always barefoot, always running,\nTracking game with all my cunning.\" Then the chief was startled loudly \nby a voice that rang out proudly. Mark and Ann stared for the flicker,\nTwo more ghost heads soon would bicker. \"This is wrong,\" the new head cried.\n\"Tell us when it was we died. \"1890? '92?\n\"I'm a ghost. Should I say 'boo?'\" They arrived, two more undead,\ndressed like they were newly wed. For the female head was pale.\non her face she wore a veil. On the man's head, hair was shiny \nslicked in place. His eyes were tiny. His bride also missed a treat\nwhere she'd dressed in fabrics sweet. As a child, and as wife --\nballet slippers, all her life. Now she stared, sad and defeated.\n\"This is wrong,\" her ghost repeated. With an angry voice her groom\nfollowed from a darkened room. \"We don't know you,\" he announced.\nTowards the other heads he bounced, As the hallway all around\nfilled with angry clomping sounds. Now the four heads -- two still sobbing\nIn the hallway floated, bobbing. Mark and Ann stared helplessly\ntil the bride shared her sad plea. \"There's one issue -- we agree here.\nWhat has summoned us to be here?\" All the other heads soon nodded.\nFrom their rests they'd now been prodded. And the wealthy woman railed\nat the way her fate had failed. \"Let us rest in peace,\" she'd say.\n\"Even on this holiday.\" \"We belong in our own world,\" \nshe complained. Her eyebrow curled. \"It must be some earthly pest\ndisturbing our well-earned rest!\" \"Find the crook,\" the Indian moaned.\n\"Who defiles us?\" Ann now groaned. All the heads that had just spoken\nNow glared straight at her, awoken from their peaceful ghostly slumbers.\nMark, in fright, returned to numbers. After all this elocution,\nWould the ghosts seek retribution? Was it dark revenge that waited?\nOr could ghosts still be placated? Suddenly, a hope Mark knew.\nHe remembered one small clue. \"Yes, you were aroused tonight.\nBut it wasn't Ann's small light. Someone's played a trick on you,\ndoused their face with ghostly goo Glowing white, but not a spirit.\nThey just wanted to get near it, So to watch when you awoke,\nspying on you ghostly folk. Not us children,\" Mark would boast. \n\"Someone here is not a ghost!\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nI re-read the poem several times and made a time line of what the two children actually experience, separating what can physically happen in the real world from what can be put down to the supernatural.\n\n1.  BEFORE MARK AND ANN ENTER  \n   •  Someone is already inside the deserted house – we know this because  \n        – The door is found unlatched and swinging.  \n        – Fresh shoe-prints appear on every dusty stair although no living person is seen going up.  \n        – From upstairs come strange bumping / clomping noises.  \n   •  Only one set of footprints is found, so only one living person preceded the children.\n\n2.  WHAT THE CHILDREN FIRST SEE UPSTAIRS  \n   •  A single “floating head” whose skin actually glows strongly enough to throw light on the dust (“dust on the floor was brightened / by the glowing face”).  \n   •  Ann screams fourteen times – clearly the head is already there, waiting.  \n   •  That head gives the most detailed “cover story,” calling itself an Indian chief murdered long ago.\n\n3.  THE OTHER THREE HEADS  \n   •  They drift in only after the children are on the landing; none of them glows and none of them throws light.  \n   •  When the “groom” head comes, the poem suddenly mentions “angry clomping sounds.”  Ghosts don’t clomp, but by then the real intruder (who is wearing shoes) is already on the landing; those are simply his feet shifting while he still tries to keep the illusion that only a head is present.\n\n4.  MARK’S DEDUCTION INSIDE THE STORY  \n   •  Realises somebody “doused their face with ghostly goo / glowing white, but not a spirit. / They just wanted to get near it / so to watch when you awoke.”  \n   •  “Someone here is NOT a ghost!”\n\n5.  Which head best fits a living body?  \n   •  Only the first one (the “Indian chief”) was in the house before the children (matching the single trail of shoe-prints).  \n   •  It alone possesses its own light source (phosphorescent paint).  \n   •  It talks the most, steering the conversation and prying (“Who are you? … You are new!”) – exactly what a living trespasser who hopes to study real ghosts would do.  \n   •  The story never supplies the chief’s death-date or era (unlike the 1846 woman or the 1890s newly-weds).  That vagueness is consistent with an invented cover story.\n\nTherefore the “Indian chief” head is the living impostor; the other three heads belong to genuine, if disgruntled, spirits.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMark, Ann, “Indian Chief” head, “Wealthy Woman” head, “Bride” head, “Groom” head\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\nUnknown man disguised as the “Indian Chief” floating head\n(alias “the Indian Chief”)\n</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>\n\n<ACCOMPLICE(S)>\nNone\n</ACCOMPLICE(S)>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  A curiosity-maddened ghost-hunter (identity unknown) broke into the abandoned house before sunset on Halloween.  \n•  He painted his face and shaved head with luminous, phosphorescent paste, dressed wholly in black, and possibly used a black drape to hide his body so that only the glowing head showed.  \n•  He crept upstairs and waited.  His movements left the only fresh shoe-prints in the dust and produced the bumping sounds that first frightened Mark.  \n•  Mark and Ann entered; Ann reached the landing first and met the “head,” which caused her long series of screams.  \n•  While the impostor questioned the children he was delighted (and then alarmed) to find that the house also held genuine spirits – the wealthy 1846 lady and the 1890s bride and groom.  \n•  The real ghosts, angry at being awakened, demanded to know who had disturbed them.  The imposter tried to maintain his disguise, but Mark noticed:  \n      – the single track of footprints,  \n      – the chemically glowing face that actually lit the dust,  \n      – the very human clomping of shoes.  \n•  Mark announced the trick; once exposed, the human intruder could only flee, leaving the children and the four authentic ghosts behind.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMark – Only frightened and had no time or means to prepare the luminous disguise; also his footprints begin only after he follows Ann.  \nAnn – Had the flashlight, never left Mark’s sight until she ran upstairs; no chance to create the elaborate head illusion.  \nWealthy Woman, Bride, Groom – All appear after the children arrive; none glows, none was upstairs beforehand, and ghosts (by definition) leave no shoe-prints or physical evidence.  Their complaints and imperfect memories are consistent with long-dead spirits suddenly roused, not with a living fraud.  \nTherefore, only the “Indian Chief” head had motive (to study / spy on real ghosts), opportunity (already inside), and physical evidence (fresh footprints, glowing paint) linking him to the hoax.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

Silently it stared, unfrightened.\nMore dust on the floor was brightened by the glowing face, and by it,\nMark noticed Ann became quiet. He looked at her, and fear grew.\nAnn had witnessed something new. In the dark, but coming near them\ntwo more eyes would come to peer them! Down the hallway, bringing dread\nfloated up a second head! It's a woman, face still ghostly\nwearing ancient makeup, mostly. Bizarre rouge on glowing skin,\nTiny lines on eyebrows thin. Scraggly hair was dangling down,\nfrom her forehead, dirty brown. With its white eyes, Ann felt sure, \nIt was looking back at her. Suddenly the silence broke.\nThat white floating head? It spoke. \"Who?\" it asked Ann. \"Who are you?\nCan you hear me? You are new!\" \"Yes,\" the other face replied.\n\"What has made you stray inside?\" In the dark and silent house,\nAnn was quiet as a mouse. \"Speak!\" the face said, angry now.\n\"What has brought us here -- and how?\" Mark knew in that haunted night,\nsilence would be impolite. So he told the ghosts, \"It's late.\nHalloween, 2008. In this house, we found your head\nfloating here. We think you're dead. Maybe there's one day between\nlife and death, on Halloween. When you feel that night begin,\nGhosts can roam the earth again.\" Ann now asked them for a clue.\n\"We're just children. Who are you?\" And the glowing man's face moaned.\nOf an ancient pain he groaned. \"I was once a famous chief\nof an Indian tribe. A thief stole into our camp one night\nand he killed me in a fight.\" Soon his eyelids closed with fears.\nWhite and bloodshot eyes shed tears Then the female head moaned low,\n\"That's a century ago! I was wealthy, filled with kicks\nback in 1846. Till a sickness in the night\nturned my head into this fright.\" When they pondered how they'd died,\nboth the floating heads soon cried.  Through his sobs, the Indian chief\nshared the reason for his grief. \"We shared meadows without guilt\nbefore houses here were built.\" And the wealthy woman thought\nof the joys her life had brought. \"I strolled gaily down the street.\nYou know what I miss? My feet!\" Both heads then looked towards the ground,\nBut no feet there could be found. \"I once wore the poshest clothes,\nled to dances by my beaus. We became such dainty trippers, \nnight and day wore high-heeled slippers.” But now she sighed.\n\"Guess it's true -- I finally died.\" Then the chief remembered fun\nwhen he'd used his legs to run. \"All my life, the sweetest treat?\nFeeling grass on my feet. Always barefoot, always running,\nTracking game with all my cunning.\" Then the chief was startled loudly \nby a voice that rang out proudly. Mark and Ann stared for the flicker,\nTwo more ghost heads soon would bicker. \"This is wrong,\" the new head cried.\n\"Tell us when it was we died. \"1890? '92?\n\"I'm a ghost. Should I say 'boo?'\" They arrived, two more undead,\ndressed like they were newly wed. For the female head was pale.\non her face she wore a veil. On the man's head, hair was shiny \nslicked in place. His eyes were tiny. His bride also missed a treat\nwhere she'd dressed in fabrics sweet. As a child, and as wife --\nballet slippers, all her life. Now she stared, sad and defeated.\n\"This is wrong,\" her ghost repeated. With an angry voice her groom\nfollowed from a darkened room. \"We don't know you,\" he announced.\nTowards the other heads he bounced, As the hallway all around\nfilled with angry clomping sounds. Now the four heads -- two still sobbing\nIn the hallway floated, bobbing. Mark and Ann stared helplessly\ntil the bride shared her sad plea. \"There's one issue -- we agree here.\nWhat has summoned us to be here?\" All the other heads soon nodded.\nFrom their rests they'd now been prodded. And the wealthy woman railed\nat the way her fate had failed. \"Let us rest in peace,\" she'd say.\n\"Even on this holiday.\" \"We belong in our own world,\" \nshe complained. Her eyebrow curled. \"It must be some earthly pest\ndisturbing our well-earned rest!\" \"Find the crook,\" the Indian moaned.\n\"Who defiles us?\" Ann now groaned. All the heads that had just spoken\nNow glared straight at her, awoken from their peaceful ghostly slumbers.\nMark, in fright, returned to numbers. After all this elocution,\nWould the ghosts seek retribution? Was it dark revenge that waited?\nOr could ghosts still be placated? Suddenly, a hope Mark knew.\nHe remembered one small clue. \"Yes, you were aroused tonight.\nBut it wasn't Ann's small light. Someone's played a trick on you,\ndoused their face with ghostly goo Glowing white, but not a spirit.\nThey just wanted to get near it, So to watch when you awoke,\nspying on you ghostly folk. Not us children,\" Mark would boast. \n\"Someone here is not a ghost!\"",

      "mystery_text": "In this mystery, tension climbs. \nAll the clues are hid in rhymes! It's a holiday delight, \ntelling of a spooky night. In that night, down darkened streets \ntwo children go beg for treats. \"Halloween? We ignore dangers \nand take candy gifts from strangers!\" Mark and his friend Ann did good, \nvisiting their neighborhood. Candies soon would fill their sacks.\nThey should carry home their snacks. Skies were dark, with moonlit clouds,\nbut they'd left the begging crowds. for one last house, though they didn't know\nit's one spot where they shouldn't go. It's a dark house, there, alone\nWinds make its old windows groan. Grass had fled its dirty lawn.\nAll its trees and plants were gone. Silence took their place, and gloom. \nIt's deserted -- like a tomb. \"This is scary,\" Mark told Ann.\n\"Last time I came here, I ran. \"I heard noises, like a ghost.\"\n\"I'm not scared,\" Ann liked to boast. No one was around that night,\nand Mark's heart was filled with fright. Ann dared him to pay a visit.\n\"Hear those noises? Mark, what is it?\" They tiptoed up to the doorstep.\nMark didn't want to take one more step. Strange noises came from inside.\nbut wind made the door swing wide. Darkness loomed, but Ann could spy \na dirty flashlight waiting nearby. With its beam they saw dark hallways.\nWould Ann take the challenge? Always. She grabbed Mark and whispered slow.\n\"Let's see where these dark halls go.\" With each step the floor would creak\nIts old wood began to reek. Dust and strange smells, all around.\nMark tried not to make a sound. Ann's flashlight then beamed the room\nsearching for those sounds of gloom. In her flashlight, she would trust.\nAll it lit were piles of dust. Giant dust balls, inches wide,\nfilled the house's dark inside. It had gathered over chairs,\nin the corners, on the stairs. Ann was curious, not afraid.\nHow was it those sounds were made? In the dark she paused to stare\nat one footprint on the stair. Grey balls bounced against their shoes.\n\"Let's go up and look for clues.\" \"Or we could go home,\" Mark said.\n\"That noise could be someone dead! Are we safe here?\" Ann said no.\n\"Even so, I've got to know.\" Mark would run, but in that night\nAnn still held the only light. From the downstairs dust that reeks\nto the old staircase that creaks,  Ann would move, then stop to stare\nat the pattern on the stair. On each step, a shape she knew: \nDarker outlines of a shoe In the dust, the stairway mounting,\nUp the steps, Mark started counting. It's a trick he used when scared.\nCounting made him feel prepared. \"One, two, three, four -- I see twelve tracks\nOn the staircase.\" Ann said \"Relax.\" Soon her light had scanned the path.\nShe didn't need to fuss with math. Up the stairs she'd quickly run,\ntelling Mark this would be fun. Leaving him to mull her dares,\nAnn had vanished up the stairs And without the flashlight's spark\nMark stood in the silent dark. Questions seemed to cluster 'round.\nWhat had made that creepy sound? Mark said \"Well, this house is old.\" \nBut besides that -- it was cold. Dust brushed up against his feet.\nMaybe he should eat a treat. Then, like horrors when you're dreaming,\nMark heard Ann's voice. It was screaming. Screaming from upstairs, not stopping.\nWith terror, Mark's sweat was dropping. Should he see if Ann was dead,\nOr just count her screams instead? Three, four, five, six, screams were shrieking\nin that house whose floors were reeking. Eight screams, nine screams, they kept coming.\nTen and more -- the noise was numbing. What was in that room she'd lightened?\nWhat could make Ann's voice so frightened? Panicking now to his core, \nMark couldn't find the entry door. Stumbling through dark surrounding\nThere was just one clue -- that sounding. Ann yelled her eleventh scream\nand just like an awful dream Listening to her screaming voice,\nMark knew he had just one choice, One way not to be alone:\nrun to where Ann's flashlight shone. Without thinking, up he ran\ntowards the fourteen screams of Ann. On that second floor that rotted,\nMark discovered what she'd spotted. What was at the stairway's top?\nWhat he saw would make Mark stop, Stare amazed, and wonder, too.\nGaze was all that he could do. In the silent evening black,\nTwo white eyes were staring back. Hovering with its eyebrows spread,\nthey could see, a floating head!!! Just one head, but in the dark,\nits eyes moved from Ann to Mark. Quite alive, its shining face\nstared at them with ghostly grace. Silently it stared, unfrightened.\nMore dust on the floor was brightened by the glowing face, and by it,\nMark noticed Ann became quiet.

Down the hallway, bringing dread\nfloated up a second head! It's a woman, face still ghostly\nwearing ancient makeup, mostly. Bizarre rouge on glowing skin,\nTiny lines on eyebrows thin.
