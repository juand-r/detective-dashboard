    "full_text": "In the distance Abigail could hear gunfire from muskets and cannons. She did not shudder any more: these noises had become a way of life around the little town. Her father and two older brothers had joined the Continental Army as soon as the British had fired on Lexington. Many of the farmers and their sons from the small town had joined the ranks and left the women, children and elderly men to fend for themselves. But they had to fight for their freedom. Abigail's father had been a minister, in charge of a secret which he told Abigail one night before he left. Up the long flight of stairs he had taken her to the bell tower atop the assembly hall. Behind the locked door he told her were barrels of gunpowder and boxes of ammunition. Taking her gently in his arms, he told her to keep the secret. “I'm counting on you to watch it for me,” he said. “I know you are young, but we all must do our part in the war. I and General George Washington are counting on you.” “I will keep it safe for both of you,” she responded. But that had been weeks ago, and still the army had not come for their ammunition. Abigail alone had the key that would open the great lock on the door. She could not tell anyone. The rest of town was comprised of Tories that would try to take the supply away if they knew, so she did not tell anyone, not even her mother, lest someone overhear them. Only she would ring the bell to call the congregation to assemble. Alone, Abigail worried every time a thunderstorm rolled into the area. Would lightning strike the steeple? Shuddering, Abigail would try to push the thought away. She must not think like that. The day progressed slowly, the same as every Friday before had. They scrubbed the floors in the house and assembly hall, while Henry, a local drunk, kept himself busy fixing things around the house and hall. A Tory, Henry had worked for Mr. Smith in his locksmith shop before he had been fired for missing several workdays. His wife and young daughter had fallen ill and Henry had been unable to pay for a doctor – on the low pay he received – to travel to see them. Since there was no doctor nearby, his family died. He then turned to the bottle to forget, also upset at himself for not having asked for help. He let pride get in the way of his loved ones’ lives, but he really blamed Mr. Smith. Abigail's thoughts turned to Mr. Smith. Besides also being a Tory, Mr. Smith was a locksmith. This had always puzzled Abigail, since there was no high demand for a locksmith in the small town. Mr. Smith was the wealthiest man in town. However, because of Abigail's father's stand on the war, he refused to set foot in the assembly hall, never having been in there, to Abigail's knowledge. Later that Friday afternoon, Mr. Samuel paid a visit to Abigail and her mother. Mr. Samuel was the only other man besides Abigail's father who knew about the location of the ammunition. He had bought the supply and instructed her father to hide it for him. He looked knowingly at her, and she curtly nodded her head in acknowledgment. All was in order; she had checked the supply earlier that morning and would do so again before bed. He acknowledged her reply. “Good day Miss Abigail,” he stiffly bowed, his old body riddled with arthritis. Although dusty and tired from all the cleaning, Abigail's mother invited him in for tea. However, Abigail asked her leave to finish beating the rugs free of dust. As Mr. Samuel and her mother entered the house, Abigail began to whack the rugs. A moan interrupted Abigail. She paused, trying to spot its location. Again she heard it, coming from the bottom of the hill her house sat on. Running down the hill, Abigail was concerned about the person who had made that noise. As she made it to the bottom, she saw the figure of a soldier. A Continental Army soldier was lying face down in the tall grass. “Oh, Dear!” she cried as she knelt next to him. She turned him over, and was surprised to find the soldier was barely older than a boy. Blood oozed from a wound on his head. He was feverish and his eyes fluttered open when she supported him. “Do you know a Miss Abigail?” he asked, struggling to stay awake. “I am she.” “I had a message from your father, but ... it was stolen.” He raised his hand and touched his head. “Someone hit me and stole the message.” “Oh, dear!” Abigail said again, unsure of what to do next. “You need help, but we have to be careful,” she warned him, “The town is full of Tories. Can you stand and walk if I help support you?” The boy nodded, still winching from the pain. Abigail helped him to his feet and pulled his arm over her shoulder. Slowly they walked up the hill. Abigail kept a close watch on both the house and the town beyond them. They must not be seen! Once inside the assembly hall, she lowered the boy down on a pew. “I'll be back with some food,” she promised, hurrying from the room. Running to the kitchen, she grabbed some bread and milk as well as bandages and water for the boy's wound. He ate ravenously while she bandaged his wound. Afterward, she retired to bed. She slept fitfully, feeling she had forgotten something. A sound awoke her and she remembered. The ammunition in the tower had been forgotten. Silently she slipped out of her bed and grabbed the key that lay on the table near her bed. Not willing to light a candle, she felt her way to the tower in total darkness. Up the long stairwell, and into the lock she fitted the key. As she turned the knob, a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed her. She tried to scream and struggle, but the voice reassured her it was all right. It was the solder, so she relaxed. “What are you doing up here?” he inquired, releasing her from his grasp. Shuffling her feet, Abigail wondered what to answer. He must not know about the ammunition, or he would have told her, but she must not tell a lie. Quickly the boy acted, he pushed open the door, and walked in. Abigail was worried and followed, but to her surprise all the ammunition was gone! The barrels and boxes she had worried and kept watch over were gone! “Is something missing,” the soldier asked of her. \"Yes...but I know who took it.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Who could even have KNOWN that the powder was in the bell-tower?  \n   •  Only four people for certain: Abigail, her father, Mr. Samuel – and whoever stole the\n      now–missing written message that the boy-soldier had been carrying.  \n   •  Therefore the thief must be the same person (or be working for the person) who way-laid\n      the messenger and stole the letter.\n\n2.  Who had a strong enough motive to steal it?  \n   •  A Patriot would want the powder to reach Washington, not disappear.  \n   •  A Tory, on the other hand, would be eager to keep it out of rebel hands ­– possibly\n      turning it over to the British or, at the least, denying it to Washington.  \n   •  The story names only two openly declared Tories: Mr. Smith and Henry.\n\n3.  Who possessed the necessary skill and resources?  \n   •  The door is secured by “a great lock.”  Whoever took the barrels either had the one\n      key (which never left Abigail’s room until she took it up the stairs that night) or was\n      able to open a complicated lock without it.  \n   •  Both Mr. Smith and Henry are professional locksmiths, but Henry is only a dismissed\n      apprentice; Mr. Smith is the master locksmith – the best qualified man in town for\n      opening a lock or producing a duplicate key.  \n   •  Moving several barrels of gun-powder and crates of ammunition would require wagons,\n      money, and hired help.  Henry is a penniless drunk.  Mr. Smith is “the wealthiest man\n      in town” and could easily hire men and teams without exciting suspicion.\n\n4.  Opportunity and time-line  \n   •  Abigail last checked the store EARLY FRIDAY MORNING – it was still there.  \n   •  She discovered the loss in the middle of the night the SAME DAY.  \n   •  The soldier was attacked only an hour or two before Abigail found him at the foot of\n      the hill; therefore the stolen message reached the thief well before nightfall, leaving\n      the rest of the afternoon and evening to act.  \n   •  Henry spent that same afternoon mending things around the\n      assembly-hall – where Abigail, her mother, and later the wounded soldier were continually\n      coming and going.  Removing the powder without being seen, and carting it away, would have\n      been almost impossible for him.  \n   •  Mr. Smith, in contrast, was away from public view after midday and had the freedom to\n      assemble men and wagon, go to the deserted hall after dark, open the lock, and haul the\n      barrels off.\n\n5.  Abigail’s own conclusion  \n   •  As soon as she sees that the great lock has not been broken or damaged, she knows the\n      door was opened by a professional, not a mere burglar.  \n   •  The only professional locksmith in town with motive, money and manpower is Mr. Smith.\n   •  Hence her instantaneous statement: “Yes … but I know who took it.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Smith, Henry, Mr. Samuel, the wounded soldier, Abigail’s mother\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMr. Smith (the town’s Tory locksmith)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  General Washington sends a young courier with a written note for Abigail, authorising her\n   to release the hidden ammunition.  \n•  The boy is spotted on the road by Mr. Smith, who has agents keeping an eye on anything\n   connected with the minister’s patriot family.  \n•  Smith ambushes the courier, knocks him out, steals the dispatch and discovers from it that\n   a large store of gun-powder is locked in the bell-tower of the assembly-hall, guarded only\n   by a girl.  \n•  He immediately organises a wagon, two or three hired farm-hands loyal to the Crown, and\n   waits until dark.  \n•  Using his expert tools he opens the minister’s heavy lock without a key, rolls the barrels\n   down the back staircase, loads them onto the wagon and drives them out of town toward the\n   British lines.  \n•  The job is finished before midnight.  Nothing is left in the tower when Abigail unlocks\n   the door a short time later.  \n•  Because the lock shows no sign of violence, and because only a master locksmith with\n   resources could have moved so much powder so quickly, Abigail at once realises the thief\n   must be Mr. Smith.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nHenry – Although a Tory and a former locksmith’s assistant, he is impoverished, alone, \nand was in and around the house in full view of Abigail and her mother for most of the\nafternoon.  He lacks the wagon, the men, and the time required to spirit away dozens of\nheavy barrels.\n\nMr. Samuel – A staunch Patriot; he originally purchased the powder for Washington’s army,\nso stealing it would defeat his own purpose.  His age and crippling arthritis would also\nprevent him from hauling munitions.\n\nThe wounded soldier – Too weak, wounded, and under Abigail’s eye the whole evening; one\nhalf-starved boy could not have removed a shipment that took several grown men and a wagon.\n\nAbigail’s mother – She had no knowledge of the secret and no reason to betray her husband’s\ncause; besides, she was in her own house entertaining Mr. Samuel during the crucial time.\n\nThus every element – motive, means, and opportunity – points uniquely to Mr. Smith.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

My father trusted you, so you are an honorable person.”\n“Why, thank you,” the soldier said, blushing slightly. “So it had to be Mr. Smith.”\n“It would seem so,” Abigail said. “He’s a Tory and a locksmith. And because my keys never left her, the lock would have had to been picked. However, Mr. Smith was being framed. As I told you, he has never set foot in the assembly hall, or climbed the tower, so he wouldn’t know about the barrels, let alone the locked door.”\n“It had to have been Henry. He’s a Tory and when he saw you, a Revolutionary soldier, he hit you on the head. After he read the message, which stated the army was to pick up the ammunition next week, he decided to make plans. He was going to frame Mr. Smith to repay him. He had worked in Mr. Smith's shop, so he knew about locks, and didn't need the key I carried around. When he saw me busy tending to you, he used that time to open the door and move the barrels down to his room. Later that night when I was in bed, he moved the barrels and boxes out to the shed. That was the noise I had heard.”\nHenry admitted to the crime and helped Abigail and the young soldier move the boxes back into the tower. Henry left soon after and traveled west, never to be heard of again.\nThe next week, Abigail's father came for the ammunition. He was very proud of the job she had done.\nNeither Abigail nor the young soldier ever told about the ammunition going missing.",

He was feverish and his eyes fluttered open when she supported him. “Do you know a Miss Abigail?” he asked, struggling to stay awake. “I am she.” “I had a message from your father, but ... it was stolen.” He raised his hand and touched his head. “Someone hit me and stole the message.” “Oh, dear!” Abigail said again, unsure of what to do next. “You need help, but we have to be careful,” she warned him, “The town is full of Tories. Can you stand and walk if I help support you?” The boy nodded, still winching from the pain. Abigail helped him to his feet and pulled his arm over her shoulder. Slowly they walked up the hill. Abigail kept a close watch on both the house and the town beyond them. They must not be seen! Once inside the assembly hall, she lowered the boy down on a pew. “I'll be back with some food,” she promised, hurrying from the room. Running to the kitchen, she grabbed some bread and milk as well as bandages and water for the boy's wound. He ate ravenously while she bandaged his wound. Afterward, she retired to bed. She slept fitfully, feeling she had forgotten something. A sound awoke her and she remembered. The ammunition in the tower had been forgotten. Silently she slipped out of her bed and grabbed the key that lay on the table near her bed. Not willing to light a candle, she felt her way to the tower in total darkness. Up the long stairwell, and into the lock she fitted the key. As she turned the knob, a hand reached out of the darkness and grabbed her. She tried to scream and struggle, but the voice reassured her it was all right. It was the solder, so she relaxed. “What are you doing up here?” he inquired, releasing her from his grasp. Shuffling her feet, Abigail wondered what to answer. He must not know about the ammunition, or he would have told her, but she must not tell a lie. Quickly the boy acted, he pushed open the door, and walked in. Abigail was worried and followed, but to her surprise all the ammunition was gone! The barrels and boxes she had worried and kept watch over were gone! “Is something missing,” the soldier asked of her. \"Yes...but I know who took it.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Henry; (b) Mr. Samuel; (c) Mr. Smith; (d) Young Soldier",
      "answer": "(a) Henry",
      "outcome": "“Who?” asked the soldier.\n“Only three men and knew about the supply of ammunition stored here,” Abigail explained. “But the locked door could have aroused suspicion.”\nShe told the soldier about the suspects and their backgrounds. “Mr. Samuel is ruled out because of his arthritis: He would be unable to move the barrels, even though he knew about the gunpowder.”\n“You are ruled out too, of course, because even if you had read the message you were bringing, you wouldn’t have moved the gunpowder. My father trusted you, so you are an honorable person.”\n“Why, thank you,” the soldier said, blushing slightly. “So it had to be Mr. Smith.”\n“It would seem so,” Abigail said. “He’s a Tory and a locksmith. And because my keys never left her, the lock would have had to been picked. However, Mr. Smith was being framed. As I told you, he has never set foot in the assembly hall, or climbed the tower, so he wouldn’t know about the barrels, let alone the locked door.”\n“It had to have been Henry. He’s a Tory and when he saw you, a Revolutionary soldier, he hit you on the head. After he read the message, which stated the army was to pick up the ammunition next week, he decided to make plans. He was going to frame Mr. Smith to repay him. He had worked in Mr. Smith's shop, so he knew about locks, and didn't need the key I carried around. When he saw me busy tending to you, he used that time to open the door and move the barrels down to his room. Later that night when I was in bed, he moved the barrels and boxes out to the shed. That was the noise I had heard.”\nHenry admitted to the crime and helped Abigail and the young soldier move the boxes back into the tower. Henry left soon after and traveled west, never to be heard of again.\nThe next week, Abigail's father came for the ammunition. He was very proud of the job she had done.\nNeither Abigail nor the young soldier ever told about the ammunition going missing."
