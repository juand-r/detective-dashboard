    "full_text": "It was Christmas, 1852, in London, a jolly time for those who could enjoy the holiday, and a plain working time for those who could not. The third type of person, the professional crook, who lived on the fringes of society, sometimes cheered the season. After all, it made rich and profitable pickings for the pickpockets who filled London’s badly lit streets. There was no one that trained pickpockets more skillfully than Fagin, who kept a training school for that illegal profession, in his dank loft on the edges of a forgettable address, not far from the black and smelly Thames River. The boys, and a young girl or two as well, were trained in the fine art of picking the pocket or snatching the purse of wealthy shoppers. The trick was to do it so naturally that a slight bump was not even noticed by the victim of the crime. Sometimes the young thief would distract the victim’s attention by calling across the street to someone else, or by yelling, “Fire!” But often the touch was so light, and the use of a small sharp knife so clever, that a purse could be cut from the strings that held it to the victim’s belt or skirt in the twinkling of an eye. Or, the victim was so distracted that, as he looked in one direction, the pickpocket’s fingers extracted the fat wallet from his inner jacket pocket. By the time the victim was aware of the loss, the pickpocket was halfway back to Fagin’s loft, sure of praise and a good, warm dinner. The Artful Dodger was the cleverest young thief, and Oliver Twist, escaped from the workhouse, was the latest recruit and student. Back and forth, he went in the loft, practicing his pickpocket technique under The Artful Dodger’s critical eye, following Fagin, who pretended to be a rich victim. The practicing went on for weeks. Finally, in exasperation, Fagin sneered at Oliver and said “Won’t you ever be ready? I keep waiting for you to steal my wallet, and you haven’t done a thing. It looks like no dinner for you, young Oliver! Then Oliver Twist held up his prize, Fagin’s wallet, which Oliver had cleverly extracted from his inside jacket pocket, so lightly that Fagin had not even felt its loss. “Well done, Master Oliver,” said Fagin, delightedly. “I didn’t feel a thing. You have served a fine apprenticeship and earned your dinner. Tomorrow morning, it’s your turn to put what you have learned into practice on the streets of London! You’ll go out with The Artful Dodger and with Nancy, shortly after breakfast.” Oliver smiled. Nancy was a young woman who often joined the pickpocket group as they wandered the streets of London, in search of victims. Oliver was pleased that no mention was made of Nancy’s companion, Bill Sykes, a violent man, “who, you mark my words, will come to no good end,” as Fagin often said, when Bill Sykes was not within hearing. Nancy often diverted the attention of their victims with her winsome smile, and then she vanished before the thefts were noticed. It was much better than yelling “Fire!” in a crowd and far more discreet. The next morning, right outside Simpson’s, where the wealthy would often come for a rich steak and kidney pie for luncheon, the four took up their positions in the crowd. The Artful Dodger walked slowly along the sidewalk, with Oliver two or three steps behind. Fagin approached from the opposite direction, while Nancy crossed the street at the corner, then came straight towards The Artful Dodger and Oliver. Fagin was three or four steps behind her. If everything worked well, either The Artful Dodger or Oliver would steal the passerby’s wallet or purse, depending upon which boy was closer. No clumsy moves were allowed. If neither boy was close enough to the approaching victim, they would simply wait a few minutes, go around the block, and try the entire sequence again. If Nancy was close enough, she might call to one of the boys, attracting the victim’s attention. Or The Artful Dodger might rudely point and say “What a pretty face,” hoping the victim would turn his head towards Nancy. Either way, once the wallet or purse had been taken, the thief would pass it to Nancy coming in the opposite direction. Half a block later, she would pass it to Fagin. The victim, if he or she caught on that there had been a theft, could only point out Oliver or The Artful Dodger to the police, and neither one would have the stolen property at that point. Without evidence, the chances were good that the matter would drop there. The little group of pickpockets also made sure that they would not return to the same street for several weeks. After all, there were enough rich shopping districts in London’s West End, all of which Fagin knew well, to last throughout the holiday season. Christmas Eve was a special challenge, but Fagin insisted that they go out and try their thieving luck, despite the fact that he had a raging, constant cough. The Artful Dodger was in good form and looked forward to the fine Christmas dinner that Fagin had promised as their reward after the night’s outing. Nancy wasn’t sure that she could go, because Bill Sykes was in one of his bad moods. However, Oliver looked forward to practicing his pickpocket skills, and so they set forth. The rich gentleman, their intended victim, stood outside Rule’s Restaurant looking at his gold watch, which was suspended from a thick gold chain to his vest pocket. He opened the back lid of the watch, sighed as he looked at the portrait of his missing grandson, then closed the watch and returned it to his vest pocket. The Artful Dodger and Oliver Twist approached him along the sidewalk, while Nancy and Fagin slowly made their way towards the scene from their starting points down the street. As The Artful Dodger and Oliver approached, the man unexpectedly looked up. His glance seemed to freeze The Artful Dodger, who cried “Nancy!” as she came closer. The Artful Dodger planned to grab the victim’s watch as soon as he turned - but the rich gentleman did not turn, and he stepped away from The Artful Dodger instead. Then he quickly glanced at Oliver, and his expression was one of total surprise. Could this be his lost grandson after all these years? Even in these patched clothes, the boy’s resemblance to his daughter was startling. The man gave a cry of surprise and pointed towards Oliver, then grabbed him by the wrists with his strong arms. Fagin, three feet behind Nancy, who was approaching the scene rapidly, now turned around, coughed nervously and fled the scene. Nancy, who had more poise, continued slowly towards Oliver, the gentleman and The Artful Dodger, and without making contact with either boy, proceeded down the street. A London policeman, posted just outside the restaurant, watched the scene with keen interest and came quickly. The bobby asked, “What happened, sir?” “It is a case of robbery, I think. Better take this young man into custody, until we sort out what has happened.” The policeman nodded, as he watched The Artful Dodger, Nancy and Fagin disappear into the crowd. “I’ve had my eye on that bunch,” he said. At Police Headquarters, Sergeant Cuff was amused. He had been following the gang, with Fagin, Nancy, The Artful Dodger and Oliver, for several weeks, as they shifted their location around the West End. “Patrolman Cavendish tells me that three members of the gang, the Fagin gang if I am correct, have disappeared. You have the fourth gang member here.” “Yes, but I believe that he is a victim himself, Sergeant Cuff. I don’t think that I was the victim of a crime, all things considered.” “We’ll see about that, sir. What property did you say is missing?” “Actually, I’ll let you figure out who has my wallet now, Sergeant. The missing property that is most valuable has now been found. I refer to my grandson, young Oliver here. And if you can tell me who has my watch, I will make sure that you have the finest Christmas dinner you’ve ever enjoyed!”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could want the watch?  \n   • All four habitual thieves (Fagin, Nancy, the Artful Dodger, Oliver) make their living by stealing valuables, so any of them would be glad to get it.  \n   • The gentleman and the policeman obviously have no motive to steal their own or another man’s property.\n\n2. Who had a real chance to take it?  \n   a) Oliver – Both of his wrists were seized the instant the watch might have been taken.  He never had a free hand from that moment on, so he had no opportunity.  \n   b) Fagin – He was still several feet away, then turned completely round and ran in the opposite direction before coming abreast of the gentleman.  He was never close enough to touch the watch.  \n   c) The Artful Dodger – He started out nearest the watch, but the gentleman stepped back from him and kept the Dodger in view the whole time.  Cutting a gold chain or removing a heavy watch while the owner is staring straight at you is impossible for a pick-pocket who prides himself on going unnoticed.  In addition, the Dodger could not pass the watch on in the normal way because Nancy never touched him (the narrative states she passed “without making contact with either boy”).  If he had somehow seized the watch, it would still be on him when he fled; but Sergeant Cuff later says only that three gang members disappeared – he does not mention a recovered watch on any of them.  \n   d) Nancy – She alone walked directly past the gentleman while his full attention was fixed on Oliver and the approaching policeman.  Her hands were free, she carried the small knife all Fagin’s pupils used to cut strings or chains, and (crucially) the story points out that she “made no contact with either boy,” but it says nothing about whether she brushed against the gentleman.  That carefully phrased sentence is the author’s clue that she could – and did – slip the chain.\n\n3. The gang’s normal routine is: thief → Nancy → Fagin.  \n   Here that routine is broken.  Fagin bolts before the hand-off stage, so the person left with the loot must be Nancy. \n\n4. Why the gentleman knows the watch is gone only later.  \n   A heavy watch on a cut chain falls into a thief’s hand; the severed chain still hangs from the vest button-hole, so the owner does not realise the watch itself is missing until he later reaches for it – exactly what happens after he and the policeman get to the station.\n\nPutting the opportunities, the broken routine, and the author’s tell-tale wording together, only one person could have—and now does have—the watch: Nancy.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nOliver Twist, Jack “Artful Dodger” Dawkins, Nancy, Fagin, Bill Sykes\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nNancy\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• The rich gentleman checks his watch outside Rule’s, then slips it back into his vest pocket, the heavy gold chain still looped through a button-hole.  \n• The Artful Dodger and Oliver move in, Nancy and Fagin approaching from the opposite direction.  \n• The gentleman unexpectedly looks up.  The Dodger freezes and gives the warning signal: “Nancy!”  \n• The gentleman steps away from the Dodger and, recognising Oliver’s face, seizes the boy’s wrists.  All eyes—gentleman, Dodger, Oliver, soon the policeman—are now fixed on Oliver.  \n• Fagin, seeing trouble, turns on his heel and runs, leaving the normal “handoff” stage of the plan impossible.  \n• Keeping her composure, Nancy continues past the little knot of people.  As she brushes the gentleman’s side she slips a tiny knife between two links, snips the chain, and lets the heavy watch drop neatly into her muff.  The broken length of chain still dangles from the gentleman’s button-hole, so he feels nothing.  \n• Nancy walks straight on and disappears into the throng before the policeman reaches the scene.  Fagin has fled in the opposite direction; the Dodger melts into the crowd seconds later.  \n• At the station the gentleman discovers the empty chain and realises the watch is gone.  His new-found grandson is in custody, but the real thief—the only gang member close enough and calm enough to act—was Nancy, who now has the watch.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nOliver Twist – His wrists were pinned from the outset; he literally could not move his hands.  \nJack “Artful Dodger” Dawkins – The victim was watching him the whole time, and the narrative specifies that Nancy never touched him, ruling out any secret transfer.  If he had the watch he would still be carrying it when he fled, contrary to the gang’s invariable practice of passing loot on at once.  \nFagin – He never reached the victim, turned round and ran before any theft could occur, and had no opportunity to receive or carry the watch.  \nBill Sykes – Not even present at the scene.  He cannot have taken the watch.  \nTherefore the only person with motive, means, and opportunity—and the one now in possession of the gentleman’s gold watch—is Nancy.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

By thinking quickly and alerting the police, he thought the gang members would leave, as they quickly did, and give him the chance to see if young Oliver really was his missing grandson, in the safety of the police station.

Sometimes the young thief would distract the victim’s attention by calling across the street to someone else, or by yelling, “Fire!” But often the touch was so light, and the use of a small sharp knife so clever, that a purse could be cut from the strings that held it to the victim’s belt or skirt in the twinkling of an eye. Or, the victim was so distracted that, as he looked in one direction, the pickpocket’s fingers extracted the fat wallet from his inner jacket pocket. By the time the victim was aware of the loss, the pickpocket was halfway back to Fagin’s loft, sure of praise and a good, warm dinner. The Artful Dodger was the cleverest young thief, and Oliver Twist, escaped from the workhouse, was the latest recruit and student. Back and forth, he went in the loft, practicing his pickpocket technique under The Artful Dodger’s critical eye, following Fagin, who pretended to be a rich victim. The practicing went on for weeks. Finally, in exasperation, Fagin sneered at Oliver and said “Won’t you ever be ready? I keep waiting for you to steal my wallet, and you haven’t done a thing. It looks like no dinner for you, young Oliver! Then Oliver Twist held up his prize, Fagin’s wallet, which Oliver had cleverly extracted from his inside jacket pocket, so lightly that Fagin had not even felt its loss. “Well done, Master Oliver,” said Fagin, delightedly. “I didn’t feel a thing. You have served a fine apprenticeship and earned your dinner. Tomorrow morning, it’s your turn to put what you have learned into practice on the streets of London! You’ll go out with The Artful Dodger and with Nancy, shortly after breakfast.” Oliver smiled. Nancy was a young woman who often joined the pickpocket group as they wandered the streets of London, in search of victims. Oliver was pleased that no mention was made of Nancy’s companion, Bill Sykes, a violent man, “who, you mark my words, will come to no good end,” as Fagin often said, when Bill Sykes was not within hearing. Nancy often diverted the attention of their victims with her winsome smile, and then she vanished before the thefts were noticed. It was much better than yelling “Fire!” in a crowd and far more discreet. The next morning, right outside Simpson’s, where the wealthy would often come for a rich steak and kidney pie for luncheon, the four took up their positions in the crowd. The Artful Dodger walked slowly along the sidewalk, with Oliver two or three steps behind. Fagin approached from the opposite direction, while Nancy crossed the street at the corner, then came straight towards The Artful Dodger and Oliver. Fagin was three or four steps behind her. If everything worked well, either The Artful Dodger or Oliver would steal the passerby’s wallet or purse, depending upon which boy was closer. No clumsy moves were allowed. If neither boy was close enough to the approaching victim, they would simply wait a few minutes, go around the block, and try the entire sequence again. If Nancy was close enough, she might call to one of the boys, attracting the victim’s attention. Or The Artful Dodger might rudely point and say “What a pretty face,” hoping the victim would turn his head towards Nancy. Either way, once the wallet or purse had been taken, the thief would pass it to Nancy coming in the opposite direction. Half a block later, she would pass it to Fagin. The victim, if he or she caught on that there had been a theft, could only point out Oliver or The Artful Dodger to the police, and neither one would have the stolen property at that point. Without evidence, the chances were good that the matter would drop there. The little group of pickpockets also made sure that they would not return to the same street for several weeks. After all, there were enough rich shopping districts in London’s West End, all of which Fagin knew well, to last throughout the holiday season. Christmas Eve was a special challenge, but Fagin insisted that they go out and try their thieving luck, despite the fact that he had a raging, constant cough. The Artful Dodger was in good form and looked forward to the fine Christmas dinner that Fagin had promised as their reward after the night’s outing. Nancy wasn’t sure that she could go, because Bill Sykes was in one of his bad moods. However, Oliver looked forward to practicing his pickpocket skills, and so they set forth. The rich gentleman, their intended victim, stood outside Rule’s Restaurant looking at his gold watch, which was suspended from a thick gold chain to his vest pocket. He opened the back lid of the watch, sighed as he looked at the portrait of his missing grandson, then closed the watch and returned it to his vest pocket. The Artful Dodger and Oliver Twist approached him along the sidewalk, while Nancy and Fagin slowly made their way towards the scene from their starting points down the street. As The Artful Dodger and Oliver approached, the man unexpectedly looked up. His glance seemed to freeze The Artful Dodger, who cried “Nancy!” as she came closer. The Artful Dodger planned to grab the victim’s watch as soon as he turned - but the rich gentleman did not turn, and he stepped away from The Artful Dodger instead. Then he quickly glanced at Oliver, and his expression was one of total surprise. Could this be his lost grandson after all these years? Even in these patched clothes, the boy’s resemblance to his daughter was startling. The man gave a cry of surprise and pointed towards Oliver, then grabbed him by the wrists with his strong arms. Fagin, three feet behind Nancy, who was approaching the scene rapidly, now turned around, coughed nervously and fled the scene. Nancy, who had more poise, continued slowly towards Oliver, the gentleman and The Artful Dodger, and without making contact with either boy, proceeded down the street. A London policeman, posted just outside the restaurant, watched the scene with keen interest and came quickly. The bobby asked, “What happened, sir?” “It is a case of robbery, I think. Better take this young man into custody, until we sort out what has happened.” The policeman nodded, as he watched The Artful Dodger, Nancy and Fagin disappear into the crowd. “I’ve had my eye on that bunch,” he said. At Police Headquarters, Sergeant Cuff was amused. He had been following the gang, with Fagin, Nancy, The Artful Dodger and Oliver, for several weeks, as they shifted their location around the West End. “Patrolman Cavendish tells me that three members of the gang, the Fagin gang if I am correct, have disappeared. You have the fourth gang member here.” “Yes, but I believe that he is a victim himself, Sergeant Cuff. I don’t think that I was the victim of a crime, all things considered.” “We’ll see about that, sir. What property did you say is missing?” “Actually, I’ll let you figure out who has my wallet now, Sergeant. The missing property that is most valuable has now been found. I refer to my grandson, young Oliver here. And if you can tell me who has my watch, I will make sure that you have the finest Christmas dinner you’ve ever enjoyed!”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Fagin; (b) Nancy; (c) Oliver Twist; (d) The Artful Dodger; (e) The Rich Gentleman",
      "answer": "(e) The Rich Gentleman",
      "outcome": "The rich victim was on a mission to discover his lost grandson, Oliver, whom he recognized as one of the street thieves. His cries scared off both Fagin and Nancy, neither of whom came into any contact with The Artful Dodger or Oliver, so they could not have been passed any stolen property. The Artful Dodger missed his chance to steal the rich gentleman’s property when the intended victim did not turn his head to look at Nancy and stepped away instead.\nOliver had no chance to make the theft, because the intended victim quickly grabbed Oliver’s wrists with his powerful arms.\nThe watch never left the intended victim’s possession. By thinking quickly and alerting the police, he thought the gang members would leave, as they quickly did, and give him the chance to see if young Oliver really was his missing grandson, in the safety of the police station. To his delight, that was the case, and the restored family then celebrated their finest Christmas ever!"
