    "full_text": "Lauren Cross-Highsmith sat in the kitchen of her aunt, Marge Cross Benson. Lauren was not only her aunt’s favorite niece, but the two women shared a keen interest in the Cross family history. And Marge would soon share her knowledge of the Cross family and a mystery going back to the first years following the Civil War. After a few minutes of pleasant small talk, Marge reflected that, “The Cross family homestead is located in the central part of Kansas, a little over 80 miles away. The main house is 140 years old and sits high above modern civilization in the middle of the Flint Hills. Once, the Cross family had been prominent in the area but the community long ago became a distant memory for old-timers and a curiosity for historians. Pioneers failed at farming and moved away because the ground was so rocky that nothing would grow. In most places, you could barely get a spade or plow into the ground. Jack and I only visit the old house sporadically -- three or four times a year at the most. Because of its remote location and status as a historical site, the state of Kansas generously assists with its upkeep.” Lauren was aware that what everyone these days referred to simply as “The House” was huge and very impressive. Marge continued, “The House contains 21 rooms. Construction was finished in 1870. The homestead included horse stables, a wash and laundry room and another small building that served as a tool shed. A garden was added for Susie Cross in 1876 and an old style round barn for a few head of cattle Wilbur purchased a couple of years after that. Legend has it that Wilbur had several wagon loads of topsoil brought in for Susie’s garden.” Marge stopped and smiled before adding, “But not all was perfect in paradise. Kansas winds blew the topsoil away and Leonard finally moved the wash room to the barn in 1905. The water pipes leading to the water well leaked ever since the house was constructed and the laundry room had experienced recurring flooding.” Marge paused. “Would you help me solve a mystery concerning the House?” Lauren answered, “Sure. What mystery?” Marge smiled. She knew her young niece would relish what she was about to tell her. She began her tale as she added fresh ice to the tea tumblers. “Family records show that Wilbur and Susie enjoyed a happy and prosperous marriage. A son, Leonard, was born early in 1873 and his brother, Victor, in the fall of 1876. Both sons stayed on the homestead until the end of World War 1, working for their father and tending to his varied business interests. Victor married Edith in 1901.” Lauren sat facing Marge in rapt attention. Marge continued, “There has been a story in our family for as long as the House has existed that there is hidden fortune somewhere on the property. Now, it was not uncommon for people to bury their money and valuables on family farms and homesteads in the depression days of the 1930s, but legend has it that great-grandfather Wilbur stashed something of value sometime after establishing the Cross House in 1869.” “A Cross treasure!” Lauren chimed in. “Wilbur was quite a man. He was a Civil War veteran who served with distinction in the Union Army. After the war, he headed west to work on the railroad. He was with Leland Stanford in Utah when the railroad connecting the country was completed in 1869. It was after that when he came to Kansas and built the family homestead. He made his money by purchasing Kansas farmland cheap and by selling it high.” “What did he hide?” asked Lauren. “The story is so old, we’re not certain, but Jack and I spent the night up there a couple of weeks ago. Let me show you what we found in the back of the basement closet. It was so dark that I almost missed it even with a powerful flashlight.” Marge excused herself from the table long enough to retrieve a large, leather bound volume from the study. It looked to be very old. Placing it in front of her niece, she said, “I didn’t know this existed. Unlike most journals, there are entries from several different family members. There are five references to the hidden treasure, but all of them tell a different story by a different family member. The last entry in the journal, written by Uncle Hollis (son of Victor and Edith) in 1947, promises that only one of the five narrations is completely true.” “What does the last entry say?” The legend was changed several times through the years to keep the fortune secret and safe. Choose well, because the wrong selection will cost you time and money. “Ah, the intrigue,” Lauren gasped. “I’ve placed post-it notes on the entries you need to read.” Lauren quickly turned to the first narration: Entry of Wilbur Cross, dated January 23, 1871: Look for gold buried six feet under the flat tombstone in the back pasture. I stole it from a Union payroll train in Elmira, New York just before the war ended. They’ve been looking for me ever since. It’s why I moved to such an out of the way place. She quickly moved on to the entry of Wilbur’s wife, Susie. Entry of Susie Cross, dated July 4, 1889: Pa died a couple days ago. Not much of an Independence Day for me. At least I know he died rich. He told me the Federal men are still looking for the gold spike he stole when working on the transcontinental railroad 20 years ago. It was to be the last spike in the track and a symbol of the settlement of the west. Stashing it away was one of the first things he did when the house was completed. It is hidden in a false floor in the upper loft of the round barn. Next, Lauren read the entries of Leonard and Victor Cross. Entry of Leonard Cross, dated, June 12, 1919: Life has not been the same since the Great War ended. Victor moved off of the homestead to work a city job. That’s understandable as the world is changing. Before he left, he helped me move to a new hiding place a chest of silver nuggets that Dad accepted as payment for a huge parcel of land shortly before his death. Look in the basement closet. There is a false wall. Entry of Victor Cross, dated March 3, 1925: It’s been a year since Leonard passed away. He was a leap year baby and died on his birthday. I’m the last of our immediate family as Mom died just before the turn of the century many years ago. She wanted to live to see the 1900s, but that is another story. What I want to say is this: Dad didn’t trust banks. Look for some very valuable stocks and bonds hidden in the wall behind the ice box in the kitchen. Finally, Lauren read the entry of Edith Cross. Entry of Edith Cross, dated January 31, 1936: There are a lot of people that don’t trust banks these days, but granddad never did trust them. Perhaps it was because he was a crook himself. So, if whoever finds this will lift the southeast corner floorboards in the old wash room, you will find a big box full of 100 and 500 dollar bills from the 1880s. Lauren took a few moments to consider everything she had read. Finally, Marge asked, “Well, what do you think?” Lauren smiled, “I believe I have some good news.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. First, list what each writer says and compare it with the background facts Marge gave Lauren.\n\n • Wilbur (1871) – Gold six-feet deep in the pasture.  \n   Problem:  The very first paragraph tells us that in “most places you could barely get a spade or plow into the ground.”  Digging a six-foot hole in the Flint Hills limestone would have been virtually impossible with 1870 tools.  Wilbur is almost certainly lying.\n\n • Susie (1889) –  The stolen “Golden Spike” is in a false floor in the round barn loft.  \n   Problem 1:  The real Golden Spike is on public display at the Stanford University Museum; it was never stolen.  \n   Problem 2:  The round barn was not put up until “a couple of years after” 1876 – so at the earliest 1878.  Yet Susie says Wilbur hid it “when the house was completed” (1870).  Her timeline is impossible.\n\n • Leonard (1919) – Chest of silver nuggets behind a false wall of the basement closet.  \n   This fits everything we know:  \n    – A closet exists in the basement.  \n    – Marge and Jack have already been in that very closet and found the journal “way in the back” – it would be easy for them to have missed a false wall in the dark.  \n    – Silver will not have been harmed by dampness or by the passage of time.  No fact given contradicts Leonard.\n\n • Victor (1925) – Valuable stocks and bonds behind the ice-box wall.  \n   Problem:  Victor writes this six years before the 1929 crash.  By now, most 1920-era stocks would be worthless—hardly the “fortune” referred to through the decades.  Also, a man who “never trusted banks” is unlikely to have put his wealth in stocks and bonds that had to be held by brokerage houses (the functional equivalent of a bank).\n\n • Edith (1936) – A box of $100 and $500 bills under the floor in the old wash-room.  \n   Problems:  \n    1. Those floor boards sat over water pipes “that leaked ever since the house was constructed,” causing repeated flooding; paper money would have rotted long ago.  \n    2. The whole wash-room was moved to the barn in 1905, so the “old” wash-room has been derelict for 31 years when Edith writes.  Nobody would choose a perpetually soaked, abandoned room to hide paper currency.\n\n2. Only Leonard’s story survives every factual test: no physical impossibilities, no historical contradiction, and no obvious self-defeating choice of hiding place.  Therefore Hollis’s 1947 note (“only one of the five narrations is completely true”) points to Leonard’s entry.\n\n3. Motive / opportunity / evidence:  \n • Each writer had motive to protect the treasure by misdirection.  \n • Everyone had opportunity to write a false lead – the journal stayed in the family.  \n • Physical evidence (rocky ground, leaking pipes, existence of the closet, historical record of the Golden Spike) eliminates four of the five stories.\n\n4. Logical deduction:  The only account consistent with every known fact is Leonard’s.  Hence the chest of silver nuggets is still waiting behind the false wall in the basement closet.\n\nConsequently the person who has been “found out” — the one whose secret is exposed and whose hiding place will now be opened — is Leonard Cross.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nWilbur Cross, Susie Cross, Leonard Cross, Victor Cross, Edith Cross\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLeonard Cross\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Shortly before his death (1889) Wilbur accepted a large chest of silver nuggets as payment for land.  \n• Not trusting banks, he asked his sons Leonard and Victor to hide it.  \n• The two brothers walled the chest up at the very rear of the basement closet, leaving a thin false wall and, farther back, the leather-bound family journal.  \n• In 1919 Leonard recorded the real location, confident that the carefully concealed wall would keep the silver safe.  \n• Other family members, either to protect the hoard or because they did not actually know where it was, planted wildly different legends in the journal: impossible burials in solid rock, an already-famous Golden Spike, flimsy paper money under flooded boards, and stock certificates likely to become worthless.  \n• Hollis, in 1947, revealed that only one of the five tales was genuine.  \n• Today Lauren recognises that every clue except Leonard’s collapses under the physical or historical evidence.  The silver is still there; all she and Marge need do is tap the rear of the closet wall, find the hollow section, and remove the nuggets.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nWilbur – His story requires digging six feet into practically solid stone; impossible with 1870 tools, so the “gold payroll” tale is pure invention.\n\nSusie – The real Golden Spike was never stolen and has been on display since 1869.  Her dates also contradict the barn’s construction timeline, proving she fabricated her entry.\n\nVictor – Trust-shy family members would not rely on stock and bond certificates, and almost all such paper became worthless after 1929.  His clue was deliberate misdirection, not a real hiding place.\n\nEdith – Repeated flooding under the wash-room floor would have destroyed paper currency decades ago, making her claim unbelievable.  She too was only adding another red herring.\n\nThus Leonard alone told the truth; the other four are cleared of possessing the treasure because their alleged hiding places cannot exist or cannot still contain anything of value.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Marge eagerly listened to her niece’s explanation. Lauren explained, “Well, I know that Wilbur was not being truthful. It is highly unlikely that a six-foot hole could be dug in ground that farmers found impossible to till. Susie’s statement was false also. She wrote that the stolen golden spike was hidden in the barn shortly after the house was constructed. The house was completed in 1870, but the barn was not built until 1878. Victor lied also. He wrote that his brother Leonard was a leap year baby, but his birth year was 1873, which was not a leap year. We also have a false statement from Edith, who wrote that paper money was hidden in the floor of the old washroom. Wilbur would not hide paper money there in the 1880s when he knew the washroom had a history of flooding.”\nLauren was excited. Marge let her rest for a moment before asking, “So you believe Leonard wrote the truth?”\n“Yes. Not only are all of the other entries lies, but you said yourself that the basement closet was dark and difficult to examine even with a flashlight. I think you and Jack better go back over there and look for that false wall.”\n“Oh, we will,” said Marge, “but we want you to go with us when we do.”\n“Thanks, Auntie! I would love to go! Thanks so much.” The women rose from their chairs to hug in an affectionate embrace. When they sat back down, Marge asked, “One more thing. You said you have good news. Was the good news the solution to the mystery?”\n“Not entirely. Grandfather Wilbur had an undeserved reputation as a crook and thief. The true entry proves that he was an honest businessman. An honorable reputation and good name is every bit as valuable as those silver nuggets.”",

A garden was added for Susie Cross in 1876 and an old style round barn for a few head of cattle Wilbur purchased a couple of years after that. Legend has it that Wilbur had several wagon loads of topsoil brought in for Susie’s garden.” Marge stopped and smiled before adding, “But not all was perfect in paradise. Kansas winds blew the topsoil away and Leonard finally moved the wash room to the barn in 1905. The water pipes leading to the water well leaked ever since the house was constructed and the laundry room had experienced recurring flooding.” Marge paused. “Would you help me solve a mystery concerning the House?” Lauren answered, “Sure. What mystery?” Marge smiled. She knew her young niece would relish what she was about to tell her. She began her tale as she added fresh ice to the tea tumblers. “Family records show that Wilbur and Susie enjoyed a happy and prosperous marriage. A son, Leonard, was born early in 1873 and his brother, Victor, in the fall of 1876. Both sons stayed on the homestead until the end of World War 1, working for their father and tending to his varied business interests. Victor married Edith in 1901.” Lauren sat facing Marge in rapt attention. Marge continued, “There has been a story in our family for as long as the House has existed that there is hidden fortune somewhere on the property. Now, it was not uncommon for people to bury their money and valuables on family farms and homesteads in the depression days of the 1930s, but legend has it that great-grandfather Wilbur stashed something of value sometime after establishing the Cross House in 1869.” “A Cross treasure!” Lauren chimed in. “Wilbur was quite a man. He was a Civil War veteran who served with distinction in the Union Army. After the war, he headed west to work on the railroad. He was with Leland Stanford in Utah when the railroad connecting the country was completed in 1869. It was after that when he came to Kansas and built the family homestead. He made his money by purchasing Kansas farmland cheap and by selling it high.” “What did he hide?” asked Lauren. “The story is so old, we’re not certain, but Jack and I spent the night up there a couple of weeks ago. Let me show you what we found in the back of the basement closet. It was so dark that I almost missed it even with a powerful flashlight.” Marge excused herself from the table long enough to retrieve a large, leather bound volume from the study. It looked to be very old. Placing it in front of her niece, she said, “I didn’t know this existed. Unlike most journals, there are entries from several different family members. There are five references to the hidden treasure, but all of them tell a different story by a different family member. The last entry in the journal, written by Uncle Hollis (son of Victor and Edith) in 1947, promises that only one of the five narrations is completely true.” “What does the last entry say?” The legend was changed several times through the years to keep the fortune secret and safe. Choose well, because the wrong selection will cost you time and money. “Ah, the intrigue,” Lauren gasped. “I’ve placed post-it notes on the entries you need to read.” Lauren quickly turned to the first narration: Entry of Wilbur Cross, dated January 23, 1871: Look for gold buried six feet under the flat tombstone in the back pasture. I stole it from a Union payroll train in Elmira, New York just before the war ended. They’ve been looking for me ever since. It’s why I moved to such an out of the way place. She quickly moved on to the entry of Wilbur’s wife, Susie. Entry of Susie Cross, dated July 4, 1889: Pa died a couple days ago. Not much of an Independence Day for me. At least I know he died rich. He told me the Federal men are still looking for the gold spike he stole when working on the transcontinental railroad 20 years ago. It was to be the last spike in the track and a symbol of the settlement of the west. Stashing it away was one of the first things he did when the house was completed. It is hidden in a false floor in the upper loft of the round barn. Next, Lauren read the entries of Leonard and Victor Cross. Entry of Leonard Cross, dated, June 12, 1919: Life has not been the same since the Great War ended. Victor moved off of the homestead to work a city job. That’s understandable as the world is changing. Before he left, he helped me move to a new hiding place a chest of silver nuggets that Dad accepted as payment for a huge parcel of land shortly before his death. Look in the basement closet. There is a false wall. Entry of Victor Cross, dated March 3, 1925: It’s been a year since Leonard passed away. He was a leap year baby and died on his birthday. I’m the last of our immediate family as Mom died just before the turn of the century many years ago. She wanted to live to see the 1900s, but that is another story. What I want to say is this: Dad didn’t trust banks. Look for some very valuable stocks and bonds hidden in the wall behind the ice box in the kitchen. Finally, Lauren read the entry of Edith Cross. Entry of Edith Cross, dated January 31, 1936: There are a lot of people that don’t trust banks these days, but granddad never did trust them. Perhaps it was because he was a crook himself. So, if whoever finds this will lift the southeast corner floorboards in the old wash room, you will find a big box full of 100 and 500 dollar bills from the 1880s. Lauren took a few moments to consider everything she had read. Finally, Marge asked, “Well, what do you think?” Lauren smiled, “I believe I have some good news.”",

      "answer": "(b) Journal entry of Leonard",
      "outcome": "Marge eagerly listened to her niece’s explanation. Lauren explained, “Well, I know that Wilbur was not being truthful. It is highly unlikely that a six-foot hole could be dug in ground that farmers found impossible to till. Susie’s statement was false also. She wrote that the stolen golden spike was hidden in the barn shortly after the house was constructed. The house was completed in 1870, but the barn was not built until 1878. Victor lied also. He wrote that his brother Leonard was a leap year baby, but his birth year was 1873, which was not a leap year. We also have a false statement from Edith, who wrote that paper money was hidden in the floor of the old washroom. Wilbur would not hide paper money there in the 1880s when he knew the washroom had a history of flooding.”\nLauren was excited. Marge let her rest for a moment before asking, “So you believe Leonard wrote the truth?”\n“Yes. Not only are all of the other entries lies, but you said yourself that the basement closet was dark and difficult to examine even with a flashlight. I think you and Jack better go back over there and look for that false wall.”\n“Oh, we will,” said Marge, “but we want you to go with us when we do.”\n“Thanks, Auntie! I would love to go! Thanks so much.” The women rose from their chairs to hug in an affectionate embrace. When they sat back down, Marge asked, “One more thing. You said you have good news. Was the good news the solution to the mystery?”\n“Not entirely. Grandfather Wilbur had an undeserved reputation as a crook and thief. The true entry proves that he was an honest businessman. An honorable reputation and good name is every bit as valuable as those silver nuggets.”"
