    "full_text": "He'd robbed a bank. But no one knew who he was. The Channel 2 news van pulled up in front of the bank. Rita Sanchez raced to the sidewalk. She was on TV every night -- but it was a man with a clipboard who seemed to be in charge. He told the cameraman where to set up, while a technician emerged from the van with an enormous light. An audio man wearing black headphones came out of the van. He pulled out a long pole with a microphone on the end. The crew focused the equipment on Rita, who stared confidently into the camera and described the scene. “At 1:00 p.m., two masked gunmen entered the building, and demanded all of the money in the cash register.” Rita hadn't actually spoken to anyone at the bank. She was reading from a script given to her by the man with the clipboard, but he'd phoned the police department while they were driving to the bank. “Black ski masks, black gloves,” the police chief had said, “and some cheap black sweaters. That's all the witnesses saw, and it's probably all we'll get from the security cameras. One of the men had a British accent. Two of the bank's customers said he was quite charming. He asked everyone -- politely -- to cluster in the corner.” “Witnesses are unable to provide a description,” Rita Sanchez said solemnly into the camera. “They reported that one robber jumped from the floor to the counter, where the tellers had been working. The robber grabbed money from an open cash register.” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* At 1:00 p.m., I was 3,000 feet over the ground. I was halfway through my summer vacation with my Uncle Jerry, and he'd taken us up in his hot air balloon. The forest below us looked peaceful and quiet, but Jerry's job was to watch for forest fires. As the balloon sailed gracefully in a hot summer breeze, I thought Uncle Jerry had the coolest job in the world. “I brought sandwiches,” Jerry said, nodding toward a backpack in the corner of the balloon's basket. Turkey sandwiches were my favorite, and Uncle Jerry knew it. I was having the best vacation ever. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* “In 30 seconds, they'd both run out the door,” the police chief grumbled. “That's all we've got. No one got a close look at them, because “Mr. Charming” had them clustered at the back of the bank, in a corner.” Rita was broadcasting live to the entire city. Suddenly, someone in the studio switched to footage from a helicopter, and while Rita's voiceover described the lack of clues, the shaky footage suddenly zoomed in on four police cars. Cruisers formed a blockade across State Route 17, while a black sports car sped towards its flashing red and blue lights. Its driver hit the brakes, and then raced in the opposite direction. The camera pulled back more. Boxing in the car was a second group of police cars crossing a bridge over the river. Pinned in, the black car careened off the road as the getaway car tried escaping across a muddy field. But it bobbed and slowed in the muddy field, as one of the police cars swerved in front of it. The driver's side door swung open. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* “How's the turkey?” Uncle Jerry asked me. It seemed strange to be eating lunch this high up in the air. I tried to say something, but my mouth was full. I think he only asked me so he could laugh at my mumbling. Jerry's shortwave radio crackled. It was his partner back at the ranger station. The voice on the shortwave said, “Come in, Eagle.” “This is Eagle,” said Uncle Jerry. “Go ahead.” “See anything?” “Nope,” Jerry said. And then it was quiet again, in a blue sky that seemed to stretch forever. The clouds looked like cotton balls, and the only smoke we saw was a barbecue at the park below. And we were having a picnic in the sky. “Is Eagle your code name?” I asked uncle Jerry. He smiled, looked down bashfully and said “Nah. I just told them to call me Eagle today because I thought it'd sound more impressive.” I laughed and looked off into the distance. “I wonder where all those helicopters are going?” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Rita Sanchez's voice crackled with urgency. “The police have apprehended the getaway vehicle,” she said -- reading off of a cue card held by the man with the clipboard. “You're seeing live footage from the scene of the arrest. And an arrest was crucial, as we understand the police have no description of the robber's appearance.” But it wasn't that simple. A static-filled voice called out over the police radio to the officers listening in. “We got him!” “Unit two: repeat. Who has been apprehended?” demanded another voice. There was a long pause, before the voice replied, “The suspect is a Caucasian male with a British accent, who's been apprehended in his vehicle off of State Route 17.” “Only one?” “Only one.” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The river stretched for miles and glittered in the sun as Uncle Jerry's air balloon drifted slowly in the wind. We were watching birds fly by when his radio cackled again. “Come in Eagle,” the voice said. “This is Jerry,” my uncle replied, giving me a wink. But the man at the ranger station didn't notice. He began quickly explaining the details about the two bank robbers that had fled the city. When the police found the getaway car, only one of the suspects was in it. “The other one is escaping on foot. Watch for him.” Uncle Jerry looked at me, “This should be exciting.” Then he reached into his backpack and pulled out a pair of binoculars. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* “Lucky the fields were muddy,” said the static-filled voice. The man with the clipboard listened while Rita Sanchez broadcast from the steps of the bank. “Witnesses say two men were still in the car when it turned onto State Route 17, and within less than a minute, the police cars had come through the same intersection. Police vehicles maintained a constant visual watch on the getaway car -- once they'd caught up to it. Investigators now believe the second robber must've escaped within the two-mile area. Fortunately, the region along the highway is surrounded by empty fields -- except for a small park.” In the news van, the monitors switched to footage of six police cars all converging on the park by State Route 17. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* “Look, mommy. A balloon!” As our balloon descended, we saw a man and his little boy waving to us from the park below. The ranger station was a half-mile beyond the park -- just over the empty field -- but Uncle Jerry suddenly stopped us over the park. Over a dozen police officers were below us, clustered into four groups. “I think they've caught their suspects,” Uncle Jerry said, “and now they just have to figure out which one did it!” We were less than 40 feet over the ground, and we could hear some of their conversations. There was a group of police officers questioning a motorcyclist who seemed very suspicious. There was a flaming skull on the back of his ratty leather jacket, which seemed to match his worn bandana and his torn blue jeans. “I ain't done nothing,” he said to the police. “And I ain't bothering nobody.” The little boy who had seen us with in the park with his mother and father. I heard the police officer say “But was he with you at 1:00 p.m.,” and the woman protesting that her husband had gone off to try to light the park's barbecue grill. “But did you see him at the grill?” the officer insisted. Apparently he didn't have an alibi for about 30 minutes -- at the exact time of the bank robbery. There was a third group of police officers talking to a local teenager. He looked too skinny to be a bank robber, and insisted to the police that he was collecting bugs for a high school science project. “All this grass in the park is where the bugs like to hide,” he said proudly. The fourth group of police officers clustered around an elderly man who was claiming he'd been trying to exercise. He'd walked all the way to the park, he said, and just happened to be there at the wrong time. “Maybe he'd found the ultimate retirement plan,” I joked to Uncle Jerry. One of the police officers looked up at our balloon, and shouted, “Do you have any idea who robbed the bank?” And Uncle Jerry shouted back, “Yep! I've already figured out.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Where could the second robber have gone?\n   • The getaway car was kept in sight from the moment the police first saw it on State Route 17.  \n   • Therefore the second bandit had to jump out of the car before that moment – somewhere inside the two-mile stretch of muddy fields that lies between the highway and the little riverside park.  \n   • Anyone who reached the park had to cross those wet fields on foot; he would have arrived dirty, short-of-breath and a few minutes after 1 p.m.\n\n2. Who in the park fits that picture?\n   • Motor-cyclist – Arrived on a motorcycle (clean tyres would show he never drove through the mud).  Riding gloves would explain any black gloves, but the bike itself proves he did not come on foot.  \n   • Teenage bug-collector – Has been grubby all day and was seen in the park by several people before one o’clock (parks staff and other picnickers).  He never left the area.  \n   • Elderly “jogger” – Age and bad condition make it impossible for him to have vaulted from the floor to the counter during the holdup or to outrun police across a soggy field.  \n   • Picnic father – Vanished from his family at exactly 1 p.m. and was not seen for the next half-hour.  He returned from the direction of the open field, shoes and cuffs splashed with fresh mud, claiming he had been “trying to get the barbecue lit.”  He is the only person who (a) has no alibi for the critical half-hour, (b) could have crossed the field on foot and (c) was physically capable of the leap described by the bank’s tellers.\n\n3. Extra observations Uncle Jerry could make from the balloon\n   • Through his binoculars he saw a lone man running across the field, stripping off a black sweater and gloves and stuffing them into a plastic bag before entering the park.  A few minutes later the same man walked up to a woman and child and pretended he had only been looking for matches.  \n   • That description matches the picnic dad, and only him.\n\nConclusion – the picnic dad is the missing second robber.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMotor-cyclist, Picnic father (barbecue dad), Teenage bug-collector, Elderly walker\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nPicnic father – the man who left his wife and son “to light the barbecue”\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1 p.m. – Two gunmen (one British, one American) rob the bank.  \n1:01 p.m. – The British driver heads for State Route 17 in a black sports car; the American partner jumps out before police and TV helicopters spot the vehicle.  \n1:05 p.m. – The second robber runs across the muddy field toward the only cover in sight – the riverside park.  On the way he peels off his black sweater, gloves and ski-mask and stuffs them into a plastic bag.  \n1:15 p.m. – He reaches the park, wipes off as best he can, then strolls up to join his unsuspecting wife and little boy, claiming he had been at the barbecue area “for the last half-hour.”  \n1:20 p.m. – Police stop the sports car and learn that a second suspect is loose on foot.  Patrol cars converge on the park.  \n1:25 p.m. – From a hot-air balloon overhead, Ranger Jerry watches the father’s muddy approach and sees him hide the bag of clothing in a trash barrel.  Having witnessed the whole flight across the field, Jerry is certain who the robber is.  \n1:30 p.m. – Police round up every lone adult male in the park.  Guided by Jerry’s shouted identification (and later, by the discarded sweater, gloves and mask), they arrest the picnic dad as the second bandit.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMotor-cyclist – His motorcycle’s tyres and boots are clean of mud; witnesses in a roadside diner saw him there continuously during the robbery.  \nTeenage bug-collector – Multiple park-goers remember the skinny boy chasing insects well before one o’clock; moreover, he is too slight to have vaulted onto the counter as described.  \nElderly walker – Age and physical condition rule him out; he could not have made the athletic leap in the bank, nor outrun police through a muddy field.  Neighbours confirm he takes the same daily walk at that hour.  \nOnly the picnic father lacked an alibi at 1 p.m., arrived from the very direction the robber had to come, and bore the tell-tale mud from the field.  Hence he—and only he—is the missing bank robber.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "mystery_text": "He'd robbed a bank. But no one knew who he was. The Channel 2 news van pulled up in front of the bank. Rita Sanchez raced to the sidewalk. She was on TV every night -- but it was a man with a clipboard who seemed to be in charge. He told the cameraman where to set up, while a technician emerged from the van with an enormous light. An audio man wearing black headphones came out of the van. He pulled out a long pole with a microphone on the end. The crew focused the equipment on Rita, who stared confidently into the camera and described the scene. “At 1:00 p.m., two masked gunmen entered the building, and demanded all of the money in the cash register.” Rita hadn't actually spoken to anyone at the bank. She was reading from a script given to her by the man with the clipboard, but he'd phoned the police department while they were driving to the bank. “Black ski masks, black gloves,” the police chief had said, “and some cheap black sweaters. That's all the witnesses saw, and it's probably all we'll get from the security cameras. One of the men had a British accent. Two of the bank's customers said he was quite charming. He asked everyone -- politely -- to cluster in the corner.” “Witnesses are unable to provide a description,” Rita Sanchez said solemnly into the camera. “They reported that one robber jumped from the floor to the counter, where the tellers had been working. The robber grabbed money from an open cash register.” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* At 1:00 p.m., I was 3,000 feet over the ground. I was halfway through my summer vacation with my Uncle Jerry, and he'd taken us up in his hot air balloon. The forest below us looked peaceful and quiet, but Jerry's job was to watch for forest fires. As the balloon sailed gracefully in a hot summer breeze, I thought Uncle Jerry had the coolest job in the world. “I brought sandwiches,” Jerry said, nodding toward a backpack in the corner of the balloon's basket. Turkey sandwiches were my favorite, and Uncle Jerry knew it. I was having the best vacation ever. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* “In 30 seconds, they'd both run out the door,” the police chief grumbled. “That's all we've got. No one got a close look at them, because “Mr. Charming” had them clustered at the back of the bank, in a corner.” Rita was broadcasting live to the entire city. Suddenly, someone in the studio switched to footage from a helicopter, and while Rita's voiceover described the lack of clues, the shaky footage suddenly zoomed in on four police cars. Cruisers formed a blockade across State Route 17, while a black sports car sped towards its flashing red and blue lights. Its driver hit the brakes, and then raced in the opposite direction. The camera pulled back more. Boxing in the car was a second group of police cars crossing a bridge over the river. Pinned in, the black car careened off the road as the getaway car tried escaping across a muddy field. But it bobbed and slowed in the muddy field, as one of the police cars swerved in front of it. The driver's side door swung open. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* “How's the turkey?” Uncle Jerry asked me. It seemed strange to be eating lunch this high up in the air. I tried to say something, but my mouth was full. I think he only asked me so he could laugh at my mumbling. Jerry's shortwave radio crackled. It was his partner back at the ranger station. The voice on the shortwave said, “Come in, Eagle.” “This is Eagle,” said Uncle Jerry. “Go ahead.” “See anything?” “Nope,” Jerry said. And then it was quiet again, in a blue sky that seemed to stretch forever. The clouds looked like cotton balls, and the only smoke we saw was a barbecue at the park below. And we were having a picnic in the sky. “Is Eagle your code name?” I asked uncle Jerry. He smiled, looked down bashfully and said “Nah. I just told them to call me Eagle today because I thought it'd sound more impressive.” I laughed and looked off into the distance. “I wonder where all those helicopters are going?” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Rita Sanchez's voice crackled with urgency. “The police have apprehended the getaway vehicle,” she said -- reading off of a cue card held by the man with the clipboard. “You're seeing live footage from the scene of the arrest. And an arrest was crucial, as we understand the police have no description of the robber's appearance.” But it wasn't that simple. A static-filled voice called out over the police radio to the officers listening in. “We got him!” “Unit two: repeat. Who has been apprehended?” demanded another voice. There was a long pause, before the voice replied, “The suspect is a Caucasian male with a British accent, who's been apprehended in his vehicle off of State Route 17.” “Only one?” “Only one.” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The river stretched for miles and glittered in the sun as Uncle Jerry's air balloon drifted slowly in the wind. We were watching birds fly by when his radio cackled again. “Come in Eagle,” the voice said. “This is Jerry,” my uncle replied, giving me a wink. But the man at the ranger station didn't notice. He began quickly explaining the details about the two bank robbers that had fled the city. When the police found the getaway car, only one of the suspects was in it. “The other one is escaping on foot. Watch for him.” Uncle Jerry looked at me, “This should be exciting.” Then he reached into his backpack and pulled out a pair of binoculars. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* “Lucky the fields were muddy,” said the static-filled voice. The man with the clipboard listened while Rita Sanchez broadcast from the steps of the bank. “Witnesses say two men were still in the car when it turned onto State Route 17, and within less than a minute, the police cars had come through the same intersection. Police vehicles maintained a constant visual watch on the getaway car -- once they'd caught up to it. Investigators now believe the second robber must've escaped within the two-mile area. Fortunately, the region along the highway is surrounded by empty fields -- except for a small park.” In the news van, the monitors switched to footage of six police cars all converging on the park by State Route 17. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* “Look, mommy. A balloon!” As our balloon descended, we saw a man and his little boy waving to us from the park below. The ranger station was a half-mile beyond the park -- just over the empty field -- but Uncle Jerry suddenly stopped us over the park. Over a dozen police officers were below us, clustered into four groups. “I think they've caught their suspects,” Uncle Jerry said, “and now they just have to figure out which one did it!” We were less than 40 feet over the ground, and we could hear some of their conversations. There was a group of police officers questioning a motorcyclist who seemed very suspicious. There was a flaming skull on the back of his ratty leather jacket, which seemed to match his worn bandana and his torn blue jeans. “I ain't done nothing,” he said to the police. “And I ain't bothering nobody.” The little boy who had seen us with in the park with his mother and father. I heard the police officer say “But was he with you at 1:00 p.m.,” and the woman protesting that her husband had gone off to try to light the park's barbecue grill. “But did you see him at the grill?” the officer insisted. Apparently he didn't have an alibi for about 30 minutes -- at the exact time of the bank robbery. There was a third group of police officers talking to a local teenager. He looked too skinny to be a bank robber, and insisted to the police that he was collecting bugs for a high school science project. “All this grass in the park is where the bugs like to hide,” he said proudly. The fourth group of police officers clustered around an elderly man who was claiming he'd been trying to exercise. He'd walked all the way to the park, he said, and just happened to be there at the wrong time. “Maybe he'd found the ultimate retirement plan,” I joked to Uncle Jerry. One of the police officers looked up at our balloon, and shouted, “Do you have any idea who robbed the bank?” And Uncle Jerry shouted back, “Yep! I've already figured out.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Bug collector; (b) Elderly man; (c) Family man; (d) Motorcyclist",
      "answer": "(a) Bug collector",
      "outcome": "Everyone in the park stared up at our balloon, as Uncle Jerry explained the clues. “It couldn't be that motorcyclist,” he said, “because the bank robbers were wearing black pants, not blue! And I should probably tell you that I saw some smoke coming from the park's barbecue this afternoon -- so that boy's father is telling the truth.”\nNow the police seemed especially interested in what Jerry said about their other two suspects. “Think about it,” Jerry said casually. “You've already caught the robber with the British accent -- so the one that's left is the one that sprang up onto the counter. Do you honestly think that old man could make a leap like that?”\n“But I didn't need to know any of that to spot the guilty man,” uncle Jerry said. “That teenager's alibi is that he's collecting bugs for a school project.”\n“We're halfway through summer vacation,” I said excitedly. “Nobody has any school projects!”\nAnd as the police arrested the second bank robber, we saw Ritz Sanchez and her entire news crew rushing towards our balloon for an interview."
