    "full_text": "Detective Cheryl Barnes shook her head at her partner, Robert Simmons. “I can't smell a thing.” “Great,” he replied. “Your allergies act up on the day we investigate a robbery at a perfume company.” The pair drove into the parking lot of Rosewood Perfumes. Robert took a look around while Cheryl talked to the owner, Mr. Walters, a short man with a sad expression on his face. He wore a tie with a four-leaf clover and rubbed a rabbit’s foot with one of his hands. “I’m so glad you’re here,” the man said softly. “How much money was stolen?” asked Cheryl. “None.” “None? But you called in a robbery.” “They stole something more valuable -- perfume.” “Oh? How many bottles?” “One vial.” Cheryl stared at the man, wondering whether he was sane. “That’s it? Maybe you could explain a little bit?” “I can’t. I’m too upset. I’d suggest you talk to my secretary, Betty.” Cheryl nodded and walked over to Betty Simpson’s desk. Betty appeared a moment later with a donut and coffee. Cheryl noticed that she was middle-aged and walked with a limp. “I feel so sorry for Mr. Walters,” Betty said. He’s such a nice man. I had trouble finding a job a few years back, and even though I didn’t have any experience, Mr. Walters made me his secretary.” “Does he always carry a rabbit’s foot?” “Yes, he’s very superstitious. Up on his wall, he has two horseshoes. Before he starts each day, he rubs both of them.” “Maybe you can tell me a bit more about the stolen vial.” “I don’t know too much. But Mr. Walters and the staff have been working on a special perfume. This morning, a vial of it went missing. He doesn’t want to believe that a staff member took it. He thinks of us as family.” Cheryl nodded. “When was the missing vial noticed?” “When I came in -- around eight o’clock -- I heard everyone talking about it. “What time did you leave last night?” “Around six.” “When does Mr. Walters go home for the day?” “Normally, the same time as me. But last night, he had an appointment to see Mr. Danby at eight.” “Oh?” Cheryl removed a pad from her pocket and wrote the name down. “Who is he?” “A competitor in the perfume industry.” “A competitor? Why would Mr. Walters want to speak to him?” “They have a friendly rivalry. Every few months or so, Mr. Danby comes by to boast about his new product line or find out about ours. He runs a super-successful company himself. Cheryl nodded, then wrote something down on her pad. “If I wanted to find out more about your new perfume, whom would I speak with?” “Darlene. She’s Mr. Walters' assistant.” A few moments later, Cheryl entered the laboratory and stood next to Darlene Herman, a tall, broad-shouldered woman. “Can you tell me about your latest project?” Cheryl asked. “Certainly.” Darlene pointed to the glass vials sitting on a wall shelf, numbered from one to twenty. “They contain samples of our newest scent: Intrigue.” Cheryl removed one of the perfume vials and examined it closely. “They look like they're full of water.” “Yes, but they actually contain pheromones” “Pheromones?” asked Cheryl. “Those are the chemicals that make us more attractive to the opposite sex.” “Interesting.” “It's going to triple our sales.” Darlene smiled ear to ear. “You seem very excited about it. Do you get a percentage if it’s successful?” “No, unfortunately not. But Mr. Walters said because of all the hard work I’d put in, he’d give me a promotion once it reaches the market.” “Was it you who noticed that a vial was missing?” “Yes. Due to Mr. Walters’ superstitious nature, we always make sure that there are two number fourteens and no number thirteen. But now there’s a thirteen and only one fourteen. That’s how I knew something was wrong.” “So someone took one out and switched another in?” “Yes, from those empty vials over there.” Darlene pointed to several vials on the table. Cheryl made another note on her pad. “Is there anyone else I can talk to?” Darlene thought a moment. “Perhaps, the janitor. That’s Mr. Harrison. He might have seen something.” A few moments later, Cheryl spoke to the curly-haired janitor. He was a tall man who wore thick, black eye glasses. “How long have you been working here, Mr. Harrison?” “Just a short time. They hired me a few days ago. But I've already given my notice.” Cheryl raised her eyebrows. “So soon?” “Yes. I've heard they've had several janitors leave. It's not a friendly place.” The janitor shook his head. “It’s unbelievable. I'm a professional. They don’t have to tell me what to do. These people make their money the easy way … a desk job. I have to work like a horse.” “I see. What time did you begin cleaning the lab floor last night?” “About 7:30 p.m.” “Did you see Mr. Walters?” Cheryl asked. “Yeah. Just as I went into the lab, he left. I didn't say anything to him and he didn't say anything to me.” “Thank you. That's all I need to know.” The janitor grunted and left the office. Cheryl walked out into the hall and called her partner over. “I think I know who stole the vial.” “You do?” She nodded. “Even with allergies, I can still sniff out a thief.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWho had a reason to take the vial?\n   •\tArthur Danby – strong commercial motive, but he never appears in the story and therefore could not be cross-questioned.  \n   •\tDarlene Herman – might sell the formula and get rich, but she would lose the promised promotion if the scent never reached the market.  \n   •\tBetty Simpson – no obvious motive.  \n   •\tMr. Walters – already owns the perfume; stealing it from himself makes no sense.  \n   •\tMr. Harrison (the new janitor) – could sell the formula to a rival or simply take revenge on a firm he already despises (“I have to work like a horse … I’ve already given my notice”).\n\n2.\tWho had the chance?\n   •\tEveryone except the janitor left by 6-o’clock.  \n   •\tMr. Walters was still in the laboratory at 7:30 and then went to his office to meet Mr. Danby at 8:00.  \n   •\tFrom 7:30 on, the laboratory was in Mr. Harrison’s sole charge; he specifically says he was in there while Mr. Walters was already gone.  \n   •\tThe other employees were at home.\n\n3.\tThe decisive physical clue – the appearance of a vial numbered “13”.\n   •\tBecause of Mr. Walters’ superstition the laboratory NEVER contains a #13.  They always keep TWO vials marked “14” instead.\n   •\tSomeone removed one of the “14” vials and, to keep the total at twenty, slipped in an empty vial but labelled it “13”.\n   •\tA person who works there would know at once that “13” is forbidden; putting #13 in its place would instantly expose the theft.  Therefore the thief must be someone who did NOT know about the superstition – i.e., a newcomer or an outsider.\n\n4.\tWho fits both conditions: opportunity AFTER 7:30 p.m. and ignorance of the superstition?\n   •\tMr. Harrison – hired only “a few days ago”, ignorant of the numbering custom, and alone in the lab after 7:30.  \n   •\tAll the permanent staff (Walters, Betty, Darlene) certainly know about the duplicate #14.  \n   •\tMr. Danby never entered the laboratory while the janitor was in it, and the janitor never mentioned seeing him.  Danby could not have been there without the janitor noticing; furthermore, Danby still would have had to overcome the janitor and the building’s alarm system.\n\n5.\tLogical deduction\n   •\tThe theft must have occurred between 7:30 p.m. (when Mr. Walters left the lab) and the time the janitor finished his cleaning.  \n   •\tThe only person in the lab during that interval was Mr. Harrison.  \n   •\tHarrison is the only person shown to be ignorant of the “no-13” superstition, and that ignorance produced the very clue (the new #13 vial) that revealed him.\n\nTherefore the janitor is the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Randall Walters, Betty Simpson, Darlene Herman, Carl Harrison, Arthur Danby\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCarl Harrison\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAll the office staff left about 6 p.m., leaving the laboratory locked.  \nAt 7:30 p.m. Carl Harrison, the new janitor, unlocked the lab to mop the floor.  Seeing the twenty vials of the new scent, he realised they must be valuable.  To conceal the theft he pocketed one of the two vials labelled “14”.  Discovering some empty vials on the bench, he filled one with tap-water, scribbled the next logical number – “13” – on a label, and slipped it into the empty slot, restoring the count to twenty.  Because he was new he did not know that “13” is never used in Mr. Walters’ lab and that there should be two “14”s.  \n\nThe next morning Darlene noticed the sudden appearance of a #13 and the absence of the second #14, sounded the alarm, and Mr. Walters telephoned the police.  Detective Cheryl Barnes connected two facts: (1) the thief plainly did not know about the duplicate #14, and (2) only the janitor had both access after hours and that ignorance.  Confronted with the evidence, Harrison would soon admit he meant to sell the formula to the highest bidder after he left the company.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•\tMr. Walters: Fanatically superstitious; he would be the last person to introduce a #13 into his own laboratory.  \n•\tBetty Simpson: Went home at 6 p.m. and returned at 8 a.m. when the loss was already being discussed; no opportunity.  \n•\tDarlene Herman: Knew there should be two #14 vials; if she had been the thief she would never have left a conspicuous #13 in view.  She also stood to gain a promotion only if the perfume reached the market.  \n•\tArthur Danby: Was not in the laboratory during the critical half-hour; every witness places him only in Mr. Walters’ office at 8 p.m.  Moreover, he would have had to slip past or overpower the janitor, who never reports seeing him.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
