    "full_text": "“Quartermaster!” Captain Robert’s bellow was usually loud enough to be heard in the maintop, even in a three-reef gale. Today, with the Jackdaw becalmed and wallowing in the Atlantic swell, the noise was deafening. Elijah Fairfax hastened up the companionway to the quarterdeck. “Captain?” “Someone has broken the Code,” Roberts pointed into the cabin of the recently-captured Jackdaw. “One of those scurvy dogs stole for themselves. Ye know the rules. You steal from one, you steal from all. Root out this vile dog. Root him out, and I’ll make him pay.” Fairfax stepped into the cabin that once belonged to the captain of the Jackdaw. This captain and his crew were to be sold as slaves in Whydah, and his sloop would become the latest addition to Robert’s pirate fleet. After the blazing heat of the equatorial sun, the cabin was dark and cool. Fairfax stood on the threshold, letting his eyes adjust. There was not much to see: a cot, a table and chair to port. To starboard, a chest and a row of shelves with fiddles to stop the contents from sliding around in rough seas. On the chest stood a small casket, its lock prised open and its interior empty and bare. “Pieces of eight!” Fairfax jumped and swore when he cracked his head on the low beams. He reached for the cutlass at his side, eyes searching the source of the cry. He relaxed when he saw an African Grey parrot perched near the head of the cot, which was quite a prize. A talking parrot could fetch a pretty penny in the markets. A strange scent caught his attention. Orange blossom? This far from shore? He wrinkled his nose, turning his head from side to side. There. By the casket. White powder on the floor. And there, scuffed in the dust, a pair of boot prints. Fairfax turned and went back outside. Roberts was pacing the quarterdeck, his dark brows furrowed. The crew busied themselves in the waist, out of earshot of the quarterdeck, desperate to avoid catching the captain’s eye when he was in one of his black moods. “Well, have ye found ‘em yet,” he snapped. “Not yet,” said Fairfax. “Do you know what was in the casket?” “Of course I know. A necklace of diamonds and rubies. Lots of them. And two earrings to match. Made by the very jeweler to Queen Anne herself. Worth a king’s ransom. The fool tried to buy his freedom with those jewels.” Roberts shook his head, “As if we wouldn’t just take what we want anyway.” “And when did you last see them?” asked Fairfax. “Just before I rowed back to the Ranger,” said Roberts. “That was about two hours ago. And in that time, someone’s been a-thievin’. Find out who went into the cabin, and who stole the necklace, Quartermaster. And do it quickly. I ain’t a patient man!” Rapid enquiries amongst the fearful crew revealed that four men had been in the cabin in the captain’s absence. Fairfax sat in the chair in the captain’s cabin and called them in one by one. “I ain’t no thief,” said Mr Arbuthnot, the ship’s carpenter. “I came in ‘ere to check for structural damage from the dustup, so I did. And when I ain’t found none, I left.” “And yet the casket was broken into and a necklace stolen,” said Fairfax. “Child’s play for a man with your skills. And tools.” “I’m tellin’ you, it weren’t me,” bridled Arbuthnot. A shrill squawk rent the air. “Pretty necklace. Pretty necklace.” Both men glanced at the African parrot. “Mine. Mine.” “Will that be all?” asked the carpenter. Fairfax nodded and Arbuthnot levered himself out of the chair and stepped out of the cabin, his wooden leg thumping on the deck with each step. A timid boy, barely fourteen-years-old, took his place. “What were you doing in this cabin, Will?” “Looking for new shirts for the captain, Mr Fairfax, sir.” Will held his neckerchief in his hands and twisted it. “I done nothing wrong.” “New shirts?” “Aye,\" said Will. “The captain, he keeps getting sword cuts in his good silk shirts. I was looking to see if there were any here.” “And did you find any?” “No sir. The captain came back, yelled at me to hurry up or I’d miss the boat back to the Ranger. Startled me something awful, he did.” “And after he startled you, what did you do then?” “Went straight out the door just behind the captain,” said Will. “It ain't wise to keep the captain waiting.” “So you didn’t steal the necklace?” “Oh no sir. I’m a pirate,” said the boy, his chest puffed out. “I would never break the Code.” Feeling thoroughly confused, Fairfax waved Will out of the office. Will ushered in Nehemiah, assistant to the ship’s cook. “So Nehemiah, what were you doing in this cabin?” Nehemiah didn’t say a word. “Please sir, he can’t speak, sir – his tongue was cut out by the Yoruba.” “Of course, Will. Thank you. You may go.” Will left. Fairfax asked his question again. “What were you doing in the cabin? Nehemiah mimed carrying a platter. “You were bringing the captain his dinner?” Nehemiah shook his head, side to side. “No? You were clearing up after his dinner?” Nehemiah nodded. The parrot squawked, “Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly.” “And you didn’t steal the necklace?” Nehemiah shook his head, and moved his hands in an emphatically negative gesture. At a loss for further questions, Fairfax ran his fingers through sun-bleached hair and waved him out of the room. “Elijah!” boomed Bosun Ridley as he came in, stooping low under the beams. “Pretty mess we’ve got here.” “You can say that again,” said Fairfax, “Captain’s riled, crew’s upset, all because of one rotten apple in the barrel.” “Well you can’t think it was me, can you?” laughed the bosun. “Sacrifice my position just for a necklace and a pair of diamond earrings? I’ve got more sense.” “What were you doing in the cabin anyway,” asked Fairfax. “I’d have thought you’d have been busy re-reeving the rigging.” “Captain asked me to sail this ‘ere Jackdaw to Devil’s Island for a refit. Just wanted to check if this lubberly captain carried charts and instruments. Always best to be prepared, that’s my motto.” “So it wasn’t you.” “Swear on me grandma’s grave, gawd bless ‘er,” said Ridley. “Anything else, cos I’ve got to get moving smartly if I’m gonna have Jackdaw ready to sail by dark.” Captain Roberts stormed in. “You found me a man to maroon yet, Fairfax?” “Not quite. I have one question for you. Did Will go over to the Ranger with you?” “Aye. He’s a dullard, that one. I had to come back ‘ere to fetch him. He knocked all that powder on the floor and I had to drag ‘im out with me to make sure he didn’t get left behind.” “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,” sang the parrot. And suddenly Fairfax knew who the culprit was.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Physical evidence found at the scene  \n   • A layer of very fine white powder round the casket.  \n   • The powder smelt strongly of orange-blossom.  \n   • Two complete boot-prints (right and left) were visible and had been half-scuffed, as though someone had tried to blur them.\n\n2. What is that powder?  \n   In 1719 nothing in a ship’s cabin is likely to smell of orange-blossom except scented wig-powder.  Officers (and other gentlemen) dust their perukes with starch or rice powder mixed with fragrant oils such as orange-flower water or lavender.  Flour or sugar taken from the galley would have no perfume at all.  Therefore the thief was a man who habitually wears a powdered wig.\n\n3. Which of the four visitors normally wears a wig?  \n   • Bosun Ridley – an officer, expected to keep up appearances: yes.  \n   • Mr Arbuthnot – the rough old carpenter with a wooden leg: no wig.  \n   • Will the ship’s boy – fourteen, certainly no wig.  \n   • Nehemiah the cook’s mate – a slave, barefoot and bare-headed.  \n\n   Only Ridley fits the orange-scented wig clue.\n\n4. Do the boot-prints rule anyone out?  \n   Arbuthnot can be eliminated at once: he has only one boot and a peg-leg.  \n   Nehemiah is almost certainly barefoot (galley hands very rarely wore shoes).  \n   Will might have small shoes but, again, would not leave two adult-sized boot-prints.  \n   Ridley, an officer, does wear a pair of sea-boots – exactly what was seen.\n\n5. Time and opportunity  \n   Roberts last saw the jewels just before rowing back to Ranger.  During the next two hours the only men inside the cabin were the four questioned.  Ridley admits he was alone in the cabin “looking for charts and instruments.”  That gave him ample time to force the small casket and pocket the gems.\n\n6. The parrot’s evidence  \n   Parrots repeat striking phrases they have just heard.  While Fairfax questioned Arbuthnot the bird cried: “Pretty necklace… Mine!  Mine!”  No one talking to the parrot during Fairfax’s interview would have said that, so those words must have been spoken earlier – by the thief admiring his haul.  It fits Ridley’s boastful personality far better than any of the others.\n\n7. Why Captain Roberts blamed Will for the spilled powder  \n   Roberts saw powder on the deck when he returned and assumed the boy had upset something.  In fact what he saw was Ridley’s scented wig-powder, shaken loose while the bosun bent over the casket.  Will was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nConclusion – Ridley is the only man who:  \n• had motive (easy fortune),  \n• had opportunity,  \n• wears a powdered wig (source of scented white dust),  \n• leaves two full boot-prints, and  \n• utters the kind of showy remark the parrot repeated.  \nTherefore Ridley is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr Arbuthnot, Will (cabin-boy), Nehemiah (cook’s mate), Bosun Ridley\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nBosun Ridley\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen Ridley went into the Jackdaw’s great cabin “to see if there were any charts,” greed overcame him.  \n1. He noticed the jewelled necklace in the small casket.  \n2. Using a marlin-spike or similar tool from his belt he prised the lock, took the necklace and earrings, and slipped them into his coat.  \n3. While bending over the casket, the orange-flower-scented powder from his wig drifted down and formed a fine layer on the deck.  \n4. As he straightened, his sea-boots planted two clear prints in the powder.  Realising this, he tried to blur them with his heel, but the marks remained visible.  \n5. Proud of his prize he chuckled to the parrot, “Pretty necklace – mine, mine!”  The bird memorised the words.  \n6. Ridley left, locking the door behind him.  \n7. A short time later Captain Roberts returned, found Will still in the passageway, saw the spilled powder, assumed the boy had made the mess, and hurried him back to the boat.  Roberts did not open the casket and therefore did not yet realise the jewels were gone.  \n8. Only when he came back again with Fairfax was the empty casket noticed and the alarm raised.\n\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMr Arbuthnot – would have left one boot-print and a round peg-leg mark, not the pair of boot-prints seen.  The powder is perfumed wig-powder; Arbuthnot wears no wig.\n\nWill – a fourteen-year-old cabin-boy owns no wig and carries no scented powder.  Roberts merely mistook Ridley’s spilled wig-powder for something the boy had knocked over.\n\nNehemiah – the mute galley-hand goes barefoot and would have been covered in kitchen flour or grease, not orange-blossom-scented powder.  He had neither the tools nor the privacy needed to force the lock without being noticed.\n\nOnly Bosun Ridley fits every piece of evidence; the rest are cleared.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

And in that time, someone’s been a-thievin’. Find out who went into the cabin, and who stole the necklace, Quartermaster. And do it quickly. I ain’t a patient man!” Rapid enquiries amongst the fearful crew revealed that four men had been in the cabin in the captain’s absence. Fairfax sat in the chair in the captain’s cabin and called them in one by one. “I ain’t no thief,” said Mr Arbuthnot, the ship’s carpenter. “I came in ‘ere to check for structural damage from the dustup, so I did. And when I ain’t found none, I left.” “And yet the casket was broken into and a necklace stolen,” said Fairfax. “Child’s play for a man with your skills. And tools.” “I’m tellin’ you, it weren’t me,” bridled Arbuthnot. A shrill squawk rent the air. “Pretty necklace. Pretty necklace.” Both men glanced at the African parrot. “Mine. Mine.” “Will that be all?” asked the carpenter. Fairfax nodded and Arbuthnot levered himself out of the chair and stepped out of the cabin, his wooden leg thumping on the deck with each step. A timid boy, barely fourteen-years-old, took his place. “What were you doing in this cabin, Will?” “Looking for new shirts for the captain, Mr Fairfax, sir.” Will held his neckerchief in his hands and twisted it. “I done nothing wrong.” “New shirts?” “Aye,\" said Will. “The captain, he keeps getting sword cuts in his good silk shirts. I was looking to see if there were any here.” “And did you find any?” “No sir. The captain came back, yelled at me to hurry up or I’d miss the boat back to the Ranger. Startled me something awful, he did.” “And after he startled you, what did you do then?” “Went straight out the door just behind the captain,” said Will. “It ain't wise to keep the captain waiting.” “So you didn’t steal the necklace?” “Oh no sir. I’m a pirate,” said the boy, his chest puffed out. “I would never break the Code.” Feeling thoroughly confused, Fairfax waved Will out of the office. Will ushered in Nehemiah, assistant to the ship’s cook. “So Nehemiah, what were you doing in this cabin?” Nehemiah didn’t say a word. “Please sir, he can’t speak, sir – his tongue was cut out by the Yoruba.” “Of course, Will. Thank you. You may go.” Will left. Fairfax asked his question again. “What were you doing in the cabin? Nehemiah mimed carrying a platter. “You were bringing the captain his dinner?” Nehemiah shook his head, side to side. “No? You were clearing up after his dinner?” Nehemiah nodded. The parrot squawked, “Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly.” “And you didn’t steal the necklace?” Nehemiah shook his head, and moved his hands in an emphatically negative gesture. At a loss for further questions, Fairfax ran his fingers through sun-bleached hair and waved him out of the room. “Elijah!” boomed Bosun Ridley as he came in, stooping low under the beams. “Pretty mess we’ve got here.” “You can say that again,” said Fairfax, “Captain’s riled, crew’s upset, all because of one rotten apple in the barrel.” “Well you can’t think it was me, can you?” laughed the bosun. “Sacrifice my position just for a necklace and a pair of diamond earrings? I’ve got more sense.” “What were you doing in the cabin anyway,” asked Fairfax. “I’d have thought you’d have been busy re-reeving the rigging.” “Captain asked me to sail this ‘ere Jackdaw to Devil’s Island for a refit. Just wanted to check if this lubberly captain carried charts and instruments. Always best to be prepared, that’s my motto.” “So it wasn’t you.” “Swear on me grandma’s grave, gawd bless ‘er,” said Ridley. “Anything else, cos I’ve got to get moving smartly if I’m gonna have Jackdaw ready to sail by dark.” Captain Roberts stormed in. “You found me a man to maroon yet, Fairfax?” “Not quite. I have one question for you. Did Will go over to the Ranger with you?” “Aye. He’s a dullard, that one. I had to come back ‘ere to fetch him. He knocked all that powder on the floor and I had to drag ‘im out with me to make sure he didn’t get left behind.” “Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum,” sang the parrot. And suddenly Fairfax knew who the culprit was.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Bosun Ridley; (b) Mr Arbuthnot; (c) Nehemiah; (d) Will",
      "answer": "(a) Bosun Ridley",
      "outcome": "Mr Arbuthnot is innocent. He has a wooden leg and could not have left two boot prints in the wig powder on the floor.\nNehemiah is also innocent. The parrot repeats the burglar's satisfaction with his ill-gotten gains, and Nehemiah is mute.\nIt could not be Will. The captain had to hurry him out of the cabin straight after he spilled the powder, before the boot prints were left there.\nBosun Ridley is guilty. The parrot mimicked his satisfaction at having stolen the necklace and he had plenty of time in the cabin while searching for charts and navigation instruments. But the real giveaway is that only the captain and Fairfax knew the stolen items had included earrings. When Bosun Ridley mentioned this, he sentenced himself to being marooned on an island with nothing but a flask of water and a pistol with a single bullet."
