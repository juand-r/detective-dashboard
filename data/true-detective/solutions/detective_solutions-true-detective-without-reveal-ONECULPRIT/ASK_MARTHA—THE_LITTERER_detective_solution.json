    "full_text": "Inspector Samuels couldn’t believe his eyes. He stared at the huge man who had just come through the door. He seemed to fill the office all by himself. Why, he was six foot five inches tall at least. “Actually, six foot six,” the man said. “It used to be my nickname, during basketball season. But that was before the football season started. Tech didn’t get many players weighing 265 in those days—that’s when they started calling me Crusher Davis.” “I can certainly see why,” Inspector Samuels blurted out. “What I don’t follow is this ‘Ask Martha’ business. The call from the Chronicle said that the reporter from the advice column—what we used to call the agony column—was on the way to see me. Martha. Everyone knows that is Martha somebody. Seems like everybody reads that column now. I mean, my wife tells me it’s interesting and well written.” “This has to be our secret, Inspector. I was a journalism major, and jobs are hard to come by. The Chronicle had an opening, but the person hired had to cover a number of items: City Hall, sports, local crime, and, oh yes, the advice column. Piece of cake for me, except for the advice column. It seems the Chronicle had dropped the syndicated column it used to run, to save money. That’s how I started to write ‘Ask Martha.’ “Funny how things work out. I got used to it after a few weeks. Having had two older sisters helped. And in high school, everyone was always coming to me with their problems, and I got into the habit of listening closely. That’s all most people want, anyway, and it does seem to help. So writing the column wasn’t really much of a stretch, and it does seem to have caught on. “But please, this must be our secret. For the time being, anyway, until somebody else starts writing the column.” “Whatever works.” Inspector Samuels was not about to argue with this giant. And besides, Crusher was here because he had offered to be of help with Samuels’ latest annoyance, a messy littering outbreak that had enraged half the city, and all of the taxpayers. “So what do you know about this littering?” “What everybody else knows: That it is widespread, messy, and deliberate. But I know something else. Based on the letters I received this morning, I think I can tell you either who did it, or give you the clue that will help solve the case. But I don’t want my cover as Martha to be blown. I’d be the laughingstock of the town! So what do you say to my giving you the facts anonymously, Inspector, and you figure it out? That way, Martha won’t enter into it, and I’ll keep my anonymity—and my job.” “You’re on, Mar—err, I mean Crusher.” “Good. There are four letters, Inspector. They all contain clues, and looked at closely, one might even tell us who is the litterer. I wouldn’t be surprised if that letter still had some fingerprints, or if the sender had licked the envelope flap to seal it, leaving some DNA. Too bad we can’t get that with stamps anymore. Now they are all stick-on, not licked. But there should be enough here to nail the litterer.” “Go ahead. I’m all ears.” “The first letter is signed Concerned Neighbor, who has this to say: ‘Every morning I go out to get the newspaper, about 6:45, and for the past week, it’s been getting worse. There is litter all around Maple Street, where I live. Some blew onto my lawn yesterday, and it looked like food wrappings of some sort, maybe fast food, with traces of what looked like mustard and ketchup. This is disgusting. What do we pay taxes for, anyway? The local police must be asleep at the switch.’ Concerned Neighbor then asks my opinion on whether he should organize a neighborhod patrol of some sort.” “Interesting. And the second letter?” “It’s from Smug in Suburbia. Smug lives in a gated community, which is locked up at night. Anyone leaving or entering the community from nine at night through seven in the morning has to go through security.” “So what’s he so smug about?” “He says, like Concerned Neighbor, that the problem behind the littering is the lack of proper police protection. But he offers a different solution. Hire more police, he says, and the problem would be solved. He admits that it would also lower the community association dues he and others now have to pay for their own private protection, but he says that’s only fair. He is a taxpaying citizen like everyone else. That is a cause that Martha should explore, he adds. He says that he is neat as a pin himself, and can’t abide litter. It’s a real health and safety issue.” “Makes a kind of sense. Who else is weighing in?” “It’s Perplexed Dog Walker. This is probably an animal rights person, and the letter, unlike the first two, is handwritten. It looks like a woman’s handwriting. Anyway, she goes out and walks her dog whenever the dog needs to go—no waiting until the morning. She is writing because she actually saw the littering happen. It was along the route she walks her dog, along Elm as it leads into Maple. She saw litter being thrown out of the front window of a car, the driver’s side, and not just once, but repeatedly. “She admits that she is not always careful with her own trash, the odd chewing gum wrapper, that sort of thing. But this was large scale, and shocking. There was no way that it was not deliberate. She says it must have been about one o’clock in the morning or so. She signs herself Perplexed, because she can’t understand why anyone would do this. Like Concerned Neighbor, she wants Martha to advise her about forming a community association of some sort, to patrol the area. She adds that she has been thinking of selling her home, and the housing market is bad enough without some idiot lowering property values with this littering campaign.” “Did she get a good look at the car?” “The car was a full block away, and it was fairly dark out, so she didn’t get a good look.” “I’m dying to find out what the fourth letter says.” “It’s from Confused Commuter. This one is also handwritten, a man’s handwriting. The writer says that he and his wife came home late one night from our state capital, after watching their son play tournament basketball. Their son’s team had lost, so he was in a very bad mood. They stopped at a fast food restaurant on Route 12—you know, that strip just outside of town—for a late night snack. He writes that he saw someone in the back, behind the restaurant, stealing one of the garbage containers that had been taken out for emptying into the dumpster when the night shift changed. He wrote Martha because he said he didn’t want to get involved in a police matter. They went home immediately from the restaurant.” “I think I’ve got it, Crusher. Many thanks, and your secret is safe with me. I look forward to your behind the scenes help with more cases as they come your way.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Start with what actually happened  \n   • Perplexed Dog Walker is the only eye-witness: at about 1 a.m. she saw a driver repeatedly throw a large quantity of trash out of the left (driver’s-side) window while coming along Elm toward Maple.  \n   • That trash is later described by Concerned Neighbor as “fast-food wrappings with traces of mustard and ketchup.”  \n   • To be able to throw “repeatedly” the driver had to have a whole sack – probably a restaurant refuse container – inside the car.\n\n2. Where could so much trash come from?  \n   • Exactly such a container was reported stolen the same night in the fourth letter. The only person who even knows that fact is the author of that fourth letter, Confused Commuter.\n\n3. Why the fourth letter is self-incriminating  \n   • A normal customer would never be behind the restaurant at the precise moment staff rolled out the refuse cans “when the night shift changed.”  \n   • To describe the theft, the writer had to be back there himself.  \n   • He claims he “didn’t want to get involved” – the classic excuse of someone who is already involved.  \n   • Putting the two facts together (container theft + trash scattered an hour later) singles him out as the only person with BOTH the means (a whole container of wrappings) and the opportunity (out on the road at 1 a.m.) to be the litterer.\n\n4. Motive  \n   • His son’s team had just lost; the writer admits they were “in a very bad mood.”  \n   • The destructive, pointless dumping looks like an angry act of petty vandalism.\n\n5. Why the other three letter-writers cannot be the culprit  \n   • Concerned Neighbor and Perplexed Dog Walker live where the mess was dumped; creating it themselves would defeat their own aims.  \n   • Smug in Suburbia lives in a gated community whose gates are staffed and logged from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.; security records would prove whether he ever left.  \n   • None of those three had access to a restaurant refuse can—the necessary “ammunition.”\n\n6. Inspector Samuels therefore needs no fingerprints: the fourth letter already identifies the offender through his unique knowledge and opportunity.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nConcerned Neighbor, Smug in Suburbia, Perplexed Dog Walker, Confused Commuter\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nConfused Commuter (real name not given – the letter-writer who styles himself “Confused Commuter”)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate at night, still angry after watching his son’s team lose, Mr. “Confused Commuter” and his wife stopped for food at a fast-food outlet on Route 12.  \nWhile there he slipped behind the building and heaved one of the smaller trash containers – full of used wrappers, cups, and packets – into his car.  \nDriving home shortly after 1 a.m. along Elm Street toward Maple, he vented his frustration by pitching handful after handful of the refuse out of his driver’s-side window.  \nPerplexed Dog Walker, a block away, saw the steady stream of litter but could not identify either the car or the driver.  \nBy dawn, wrappers drenched with mustard and ketchup had blown across Maple Street lawns, drawing the complaints reported in the first letter.  \nTo distance himself, the man wrote an anonymous note to “Ask Martha,” claiming he had merely witnessed the stealing of the trash can and didn’t want to be involved. Ironically, that very detail linked him to the only plausible source of the litter and gave the Inspector everything he needed to solve the case.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Concerned Neighbor: Nothing but a complainant; his lawn is one of the ones fouled. No reason to soil his own property and no access to large quantities of fast-food trash.  \n• Perplexed Dog Walker: She was on foot, not in a car, and is the person who actually observed the dumping. Her story fits the known time line.  \n• Smug in Suburbia: Would have had to pass a staffed gate at about 1 a.m.; security logs would show the passage, and any such passage would immediately draw attention. No evidence that he ever left the enclave.  \nOnly Confused Commuter was in position, had the necessary supply of trash, and accidentally revealed his guilt by describing the theft of the garbage container he himself took.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "correct_answer": "(d) Smug in Suburbia",
    "reveal_text": "The four letters together give a picture of the littering. Confused Commuter saw the litterer stealing a full trash container from behind a fast food restaurant. (He was with his wife, and went home immediately, so could not be guilty of sustained littering.) Concerned Neighbor saw the litter on his own block early in the morning. (A litterer would be very unlikely to strew trash all over his block, some of which would go onto his own lawn.) Perplexed Dog Walker saw that it was a repeated action, large scale. (Since she was trying to sell her own house, she would not litter the neighborhood and lower her own property’s value even more.)\nThat leaves the actual litterer, Smug in Suburbia. He wants to stop paying for private police protection at his gated community, and believes that his littering campaign will drive the city to hiring more people. We would not be surprised if he also plans to buy depressed properties in the neighborhoods where he has littered. The police will be helped by the records of the security guards at his gated community. Every night, they will have clocked him in and out, as he left the community for his littering campaign. The letter from Smug in Suburbia, even if it does not contain fingerprints or DNA—which would itself be a highly suspicious development—will soon be matched against those security records.",

And the second letter?” “It’s from Smug in Suburbia. Smug lives in a gated community, which is locked up at night. Anyone leaving or entering the community from nine at night through seven in the morning has to go through security.” “So what’s he so smug about?” “He says, like Concerned Neighbor, that the problem behind the littering is the lack of proper police protection. But he offers a different solution. Hire more police, he says, and the problem would be solved. He admits that it would also lower the community association dues he and others now have to pay for their own private protection, but he says that’s only fair. He is a taxpaying citizen like everyone else. That is a cause that Martha should explore, he adds. He says that he is neat as a pin himself, and can’t abide litter. It’s a real health and safety issue.” “Makes a kind of sense. Who else is weighing in?” “It’s Perplexed Dog Walker. This is probably an animal rights person, and the letter, unlike the first two, is handwritten. It looks like a woman’s handwriting. Anyway, she goes out and walks her dog whenever the dog needs to go—no waiting until the morning. She is writing because she actually saw the littering happen. It was along the route she walks her dog, along Elm as it leads into Maple. She saw litter being thrown out of the front window of a car, the driver’s side, and not just once, but repeatedly. “She admits that she is not always careful with her own trash, the odd chewing gum wrapper, that sort of thing. But this was large scale, and shocking. There was no way that it was not deliberate. She says it must have been about one o’clock in the morning or so. She signs herself Perplexed, because she can’t understand why anyone would do this. Like Concerned Neighbor, she wants Martha to advise her about forming a community association of some sort, to patrol the area. She adds that she has been thinking of selling her home, and the housing market is bad enough without some idiot lowering property values with this littering campaign.” “Did she get a good look at the car?” “The car was a full block away, and it was fairly dark out, so she didn’t get a good look.” “I’m dying to find out what the fourth letter says.” “It’s from Confused Commuter. This one is also handwritten, a man’s handwriting. The writer says that he and his wife came home late one night from our state capital, after watching their son play tournament basketball. Their son’s team had lost, so he was in a very bad mood. They stopped at a fast food restaurant on Route 12—you know, that strip just outside of town—for a late night snack. He writes that he saw someone in the back, behind the restaurant, stealing one of the garbage containers that had been taken out for emptying into the dumpster when the night shift changed. He wrote Martha because he said he didn’t want to get involved in a police matter. They went home immediately from the restaurant.” “I think I’ve got it, Crusher. Many thanks, and your secret is safe with me. I look forward to your behind the scenes help with more cases as they come your way.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Concerned Neighbor; (b) Confused Commuter; (c) Perplexed Dog Walker; (d) Smug in Suburbia",
      "answer": "(d) Smug in Suburbia",
      "outcome": "The four letters together give a picture of the littering. Confused Commuter saw the litterer stealing a full trash container from behind a fast food restaurant. (He was with his wife, and went home immediately, so could not be guilty of sustained littering.) Concerned Neighbor saw the litter on his own block early in the morning. (A litterer would be very unlikely to strew trash all over his block, some of which would go onto his own lawn.) Perplexed Dog Walker saw that it was a repeated action, large scale. (Since she was trying to sell her own house, she would not litter the neighborhood and lower her own property’s value even more.)\nThat leaves the actual litterer, Smug in Suburbia. He wants to stop paying for private police protection at his gated community, and believes that his littering campaign will drive the city to hiring more people. We would not be surprised if he also plans to buy depressed properties in the neighborhoods where he has littered. The police will be helped by the records of the security guards at his gated community. Every night, they will have clocked him in and out, as he left the community for his littering campaign. The letter from Smug in Suburbia, even if it does not contain fingerprints or DNA—which would itself be a highly suspicious development—will soon be matched against those security records."
