    "full_text": "Professor Moriarty was pleased with the criminal he had selected to rid London, once and for all, of Sherlock Holmes. Fastidious Fred Fielder was, as his nickname implied, a man who could dress the part, any part. He could be at home in a drawing room in London’s elite West End, or he could disguise himself in a number of costumes to fit into any locale. Furthermore, he was not known in London, having committed his larcenies and occasional murders in Liverpool. Yes, Fastidious Fred was the man for the job. And he’d won the right to do the job, and earn a large amount of money, in a contest carefully arranged by Moriarty. Now, Fastidious Fred’s preparations had been made: He’d sent tickets for a violin concert to Sherlock Holmes. The show was scheduled for the following night. The bait should be irresistible—Holmes loved music if indeed he loved anything or anyone, and the featured soloist, Sarasate, was his special favorite. Sarasate played the violin like that wizard Paganini had done, captivating audiences. And so the trap was set. Fastidious Fred’s plan was in action. Soon, Moriarty would never again have to worry about Holmes spoiling his criminal plans. ***** Sherlock Holmes and Dr. James Watson were looking forward to enjoying the evening of fine violin playing by the virtuoso Sarasate. The tickets had been delivered the previous day by messenger. If asked, the messenger reported as he handed over the envelope, he was only to say they were from an admirer of the great consulting detective. For his trouble, the messenger had been given the generous sum of one shilling. Dr. Watson had advised strongly against accepting the tickets. “Just think, Holmes,” he said, “this may compromise your reputation. If word got about that you were accepting expensive tickets like this from anonymous admirers …” “I hardly think so, Watson,” Holmes replied. “And in fact, I was looking forward to this concert. Sarasate is quite the finest violinist playing in the concert halls today. It is a privilege to hear him, and you know, when I sent over to buy tickets a few days ago, they were all sold out.” “Were they?” “They were. This unexpected gift suggests several possibilities, Watson. One of which is what they purport to be at face value.” Watson snorted. “It seems to me that someone had the tickets, and then just decided not to use them. It was one of your admirers, surely. A nice gesture, I call it.” “Well, you are partly right. Someone had the seats, and then sent them to us just yesterday. It could have been simply a generous gesture. But since the concert has been sold out for several days, my anonymous admirer has had these tickets for a while—long enough to formulate a plan, I should think. So we cannot exclude the possibility of a more sinister purpose.” “Good heavens, Holmes. Do you mean that this may actually be a trap of some sort?” “I do hope so, Watson. Things have been tedious of late. The music will be entertaining, and it could just sharpen our wits for what may happen later in the evening.” ***** To Watson’s amazement, as the two men had descended from their quarters to Baker Street, a hansom cab awaited them. “It’s all arranged, gentlemen,” said the smartly dressed cab driver. He shifted the reins into his left hand to lift his hat to Holmes and Watson. “You’ll be at the concert hall in a jiffy.” “And will you be taking us back after the concert?” Holmes asked. “I know nothing about that, sir,” the cabbie replied, “so you should probably hire your own cab for the return.” “More and more interesting,” Holmes muttered, as he and Dr. Watson entered the cab. Upon arriving at the concert hall, Holmes stopped at the ticket office. “Why do that, old man? We’ve got our tickets already,” said Watson. Holmes had a quick conversation with the ticket seller, then returned to where Watson stood. “She remembers it perfectly well, Watson, even though the sale was five days ago. She notices details; all the more so since she is not allowed to leave her ticket booth during performances, in case a latecomer arrives. We have special box seats, it appears. Right next to the Royal Box, in fact, and this very box was specifically requested by the purchaser. And the curious thing is that there are three seats in our box, and all three were sold at the same time.” “Who bought them?” “A man in his mid-forties, tall and well dressed.” Holmes spun his mental file of suspects, his brain a computer before computers were invented. “Yes, the problem is more and more interesting. I wonder, now...” They were shown to their box by the theater usher. Holmes noticed a plainclothes policeman whom he recognized standing on duty just outside the Royal Box. “I hope you will enjoy the concert, gentlemen,” the usher said, pocketing the tip that Watson gave him. Closing the door behind them, he added, “I’ll see you at intermission, if you would like to order drinks.” Holmes waited a moment, got up from his seat, left the box, and approached the policeman outside the Royal Box. Yes, he learned, the Queen was expected to be in attendance. No, it had not been announced. She would arrive during the intermission. “Then there is just enough time,” Holmes said. He scribbled a note to Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, and gave it to the policeman to deliver. Holmes then he settled down next to Dr. Watson to enjoy the concert. Loud applause followed the final notes of the first half of the concert. The concertgoers gradually stood and stretched. Several began to make their way to the bar, others headed outside for a breath of fresh air. “So you got my note, Inspector Lestrade?” Holmes asked as the inspector approached through the crowd with several of his men. “Yes, indeed,” the Scotland Yard detective answered. “The policeman on duty has been with us for years, and is one of our most reliable men. I hope we are in good time.” He joined Watson and Holmes in the third seat of their box. Their usher peered in to see that everything was all right. Then, a few minutes later, he returned with a tray holding three drinks, proclaiming, “Compliments of the house.” “I could prolong the puzzle, gentlemen,” said Holmes, “but that would not be right, with Her Majesty expected. You should perhaps make an arrest, Lestrade. Then we will surely all enjoy the rest of the concert.” He whispered something to Lestrade. As the policemen went to make the arrest, Holmes leaned over the rail of the box, searching the audience below. As expected he saw Professor Moriarty in the audience, regaining his seat. Holmes smiled, Moriarty frowned, and each man knew that another Moriarty plot had been foiled by the great detective, Sherlock Holmes. Raising his drink, Dr. Watson asked Holmes what had happened.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  The anonymous present of two extremely scarce tickets told Holmes at once that a plan had been laid well in advance – somebody had bought THREE seats five-days earlier, had used a messenger to pass two of them to Baker Street, and had carefully chosen the box that adjoined the Royal Box.  Such pains are taken only by a dangerous enemy with a definite object in view.\n\n2.  Three seats had been paid for, yet only two names (Holmes and Watson) were on the envelope.  Why pay for a third place unless the purchaser meant to occupy it himself ‑ or wished to enter the box later without being stopped by an usher?\n\n3.  The simplest method of murdering Holmes inside a crowded concert-hall is poison, not firearms.  Poison can be administered in wine during the interval, when the audience is on its feet and the lights are half lowered.\n\n4.  The only people who had free access to the private boxes during the interval were the uniformed (or liveried) attendants of the hall.  Therefore the murderer would have to come disguised as such an attendant.\n\n5.  At the beginning of the interval “their usher” looked in, and a few minutes later he returned carrying a tray:  “Compliments of the house.”  \n    •  The house never sends free drinks to ordinary patrons.  \n    •  Only the usher knew Lestrade had now filled the previously empty third seat – yet he still brought exactly three glasses.  He had intended two of them for Holmes and Watson and one as his own alibi for entering the box; when he found a third man already there he kept to his story rather than betray surprise.\n\n6.  The cabman who carried Holmes and Watson to the concert and the usher who attended their box were both described as smartly-dressed, obliging, and unknown to the regular staff – precisely the kind of multiple disguise at which “Fastidious” Fred Fielder was said to excel.\n\n7.  Having recognised the ruse, Holmes wrote to Lestrade before the interval so that plain-clothes men would be on hand.  When the poisoned drinks appeared he had absolute proof, whispered the facts to Lestrade, and the policemen “went to make the arrest” – obviously of the usher who had just left the box.\n\n8.  Professor Moriarty, seen resuming his seat in the stalls, was the brains behind the plot, but not the man who physically attempted the murder.  Holmes’s object was to stop the assassin immediately; Moriarty must wait for another day.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFastidious Fred Fielder, Professor James Moriarty, the ticket-office clerk, the cab driver, the policeman outside the Royal Box, the concert-hall usher\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nFastidious “Fred” Fielder (in the disguise of the concert-hall usher – and earlier as the cab driver)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Five days before the performance Fastidious Fred, acting on Moriarty’s orders, bought three seats in the box next to the Royal Box.  \n• His scheme:  send two of the tickets to Holmes so that the detective and Dr. Watson would be present; keep the third for himself; enter the box during the interval disguised as a hall usher; offer wine “from the house” laced with a fast-acting poison; watch Holmes collapse during the second half; slip away amid the general confusion.  \n• He therefore hired a messenger to deliver the tickets and, on the evening itself, drove the intended victims to the hall himself, already disguised as a smart cabbie so that he could observe them at close quarters.  \n• Once they were seated, Fred donned the hall livery and served as “their” usher.  He looked in at the start of the interval to make sure the box was still occupied by only two men, hurried below, poured the prepared drinks, and returned with the tray.  \n• Holmes had already spotted the plot (unused third seat, special box, unknown usher, improbable free drinks).  Before the interval he warned Scotland Yard.  Lestrade installed himself in the vacant seat, and when the drinks arrived Holmes identified the usher as the would-be poisoner.  \n• Lestrade’s men followed the usher out of the box, seized him, and found the poisoned decanter among his effects.  The assassin proved to be Fastidious Fred Fielder, wanted in Liverpool for “larcenies and occasional murders.”  \n• Moriarty, watching from the stalls, saw the arrest take place and realised the game was up – for that night at least.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Professor Moriarty – Mastermind of the plot but not the person who attempted the murder inside the hall; Holmes asked Lestrade to arrest the man who posed the immediate danger, not the professor sitting lawfully among the audience.\n• Ticket-office clerk – Merely sold the tickets and provided Holmes with the helpful description of the purchaser.\n• Cab driver – The “cabbie” and the usher were one and the same man: Fastidious Fred in different costumes.  There was no separate cabman to arrest.\n• Policeman outside the Royal Box – A long-serving officer personally known to Holmes and fully vouched for by Scotland Yard.\n• Concert-hall usher (regular staff) – The regular usher for that part of the house was quietly relieved for a few minutes by Fred wearing identical livery; the true employee never entered Holmes’s box or carried any drinks, and was later found baffled but blameless.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

And the curious thing is that there are three seats in our box, and all three were sold at the same time.” “Who bought them?” “A man in his mid-forties, tall and well dressed.” Holmes spun his mental file of suspects, his brain a computer before computers were invented. “Yes, the problem is more and more interesting. I wonder, now...” They were shown to their box by the theater usher. Holmes noticed a plainclothes policeman whom he recognized standing on duty just outside the Royal Box. “I hope you will enjoy the concert, gentlemen,” the usher said, pocketing the tip that Watson gave him. Closing the door behind them, he added, “I’ll see you at intermission, if you would like to order drinks.” Holmes waited a moment, got up from his seat, left the box, and approached the policeman outside the Royal Box. Yes, he learned, the Queen was expected to be in attendance. No, it had not been announced. She would arrive during the intermission. “Then there is just enough time,” Holmes said. He scribbled a note to Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, and gave it to the policeman to deliver. Holmes then he settled down next to Dr. Watson to enjoy the concert. Loud applause followed the final notes of the first half of the concert. The concertgoers gradually stood and stretched. Several began to make their way to the bar, others headed outside for a breath of fresh air. “So you got my note, Inspector Lestrade?” Holmes asked as the inspector approached through the crowd with several of his men. “Yes, indeed,” the Scotland Yard detective answered. “The policeman on duty has been with us for years, and is one of our most reliable men. I hope we are in good time.” He joined Watson and Holmes in the third seat of their box. Their usher peered in to see that everything was all right. Then, a few minutes later, he returned with a tray holding three drinks, proclaiming, “Compliments of the house.” “I could prolong the puzzle, gentlemen,” said Holmes, “but that would not be right, with Her Majesty expected. You should perhaps make an arrest, Lestrade. Then we will surely all enjoy the rest of the concert.” He whispered something to Lestrade. As the policemen went to make the arrest, Holmes leaned over the rail of the box, searching the audience below. As expected he saw Professor Moriarty in the audience, regaining his seat. Holmes smiled, Moriarty frowned, and each man knew that another Moriarty plot had been foiled by the great detective, Sherlock Holmes. Raising his drink, Dr. Watson asked Holmes what had happened.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Hansom Cab Driver; (b) Policeman; (c) Theater Usher; (d) Ticket Seller",
      "answer": "(c) Theater Usher",
      "outcome": "Holmes was right to suspect a hidden motive for the concert tickets from his anonymous admirer. One of the persons who Holmes and Watson dealt with was the would-be killer in disguise, Fastidious Fred Fielder, hired by Moriarty to kill the great detective. It could not be the Hansom Cab Driver, since he was merely chosen to deliver Holmes and Watson to the theater. He made no arrangement to pick them up again after the performance. The Ticker Seller was helpful to Holmes, and she could not leave her ticket selling booth during the performance. Similarly, the Policeman was well situated to do harm, but he was a trusted, known man, according to Inspector Lestrade. Holmes knew him by sight.\n\nThat leaves the Theater Usher. He was the killer in disguise, and the drinks that he served contained poison. The murders were even to have occurred in the presence of the Queen, whose arrival at the end of intermission would have caused a great stir, which would soon have given way to panic as the murdered men were discovered in the very next box. It would have been the triumph of Professor Moriarty’s criminal career. Instead, it marked another failure in his duel of wits with Sherlock Holmes."
