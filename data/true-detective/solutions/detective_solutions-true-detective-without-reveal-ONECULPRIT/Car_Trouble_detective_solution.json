    "full_text": "Who did this? I asked myself, not believing what was in front of me. I had arrived at my psychology office at ten this morning, as usual. Then, I walked across the road to the local coffee shop, had a latte and half an hour later headed back to the office. That’s when I saw my slashed tires. I was shocked! The fact that four tires had been cut instead of just one indicated that it wasn’t just a prank by some kids in the neighborhood. It was obviously done by someone who had issues with me. Immediately, I narrowed it down to four possibilities. They were my “red-zone” patients -- ones that I had not yet been able to help. I dashed into my office, dug up their files and asked my secretary, Renata, to try and schedule all of them for today. Then I had her phone the Auto Club about my car. I decided I would speak to each of the patients and attempt to figure out the culprit. However, I knew that I couldn’t merely ask them about the incident -- some might react badly. I would have to watch for subtle clues. I only had to wait a few moments before Renata buzzed to let me know that Mrs. Roberts had arrived. The door to my office opened and in she trotted. She was blonde and weighed far too much for her small frame. We had been trying to discover the psychological reasons for her compulsive over-eating but so far no luck. “Hello, Mrs. Roberts, how’s everything going?” “Not very well,” she said, pointing a chubby finger at me. “Your suggestions don’t seem to work at all.” “I see. You blame me?” “You know what I’ve lost so far? Three pounds. I still can’t bend down to kiss my kids. How am I going to go to that wedding next week looking like this?” “Mrs. Roberts, rather than being so upset, you should congratulate yourself on your success.” She grimaced. “What success? It’s only three pounds.” “Yes that’s true. But many of my patients would be thrilled they lost anything. Most of them are gaining by the week.” She paused for a moment, seemed to be thinking that over. Suddenly, she sat up a little straighter in her chair, her pale face gaining a bit of color. She seemed a bit more optimistic now and we continued talking about her weight until her hour was up. Then I asked Renata to send in the next patient. Randy Peters stumbled in and cautiously walked towards the chair in front of my desk. “What’s wrong Mr. Peters?” “Lost my contacts, doc. Don’t know where I put them.” He felt for the chair and sat down. “Be careful, Mr. Peters. That’s dangerous.” “Yes, I know. I’m taking a taxi home.” “Good.” I nodded. “I was curious how everything is going?” “Not very well.” “You told me last week that you were having more frequent dreams.” He nodded. “Yesterday was the worst. The man in the mask chased me down the street. But I finally stood up to him and ripped his mask off.” “Was the face familiar to you?” “Now that you mention it he may have looked a bit like you, doc.” “Like me? What do you think that means?” He shrugged. “I don’t know. But it upset me a great deal to see you staring at me.” He gestured with his hand and knocked over my penholder. “Sorry doc.” He quickly picked up all the pens and dropped them back into the holder. Suddenly, he smiled. “I got it, Doc. You remind me of my dad and I never got along with him. That’s why I must have gotten upset when I saw you in the dream.” I was happy we had made some progress in his therapy. We continued talking more about his father until it was time for my next patient. Mr. Carlson entered my office and grimaced as he looked down at the chair in front of him. “Is it okay if I stand doctor?” “Yes, that’s fine.” Mr. Carlson had a phobia about germs and it seemed to be getting worse. “How are things going?” “Not well. Today, I couldn’t even touch my computer at work.” “Did you try the affirmations like we did with some of your other obsessions?” “It didn’t do any good. In fact, I got so upset, I wanted to take it out on somebody.” He stared at me. “Did anything unusual happen to you the week before this started?” He started to lean against the wall, but then looked at it and moved away. “Well last week, I accidentally locked myself in the garage. It was very messy and I was stuck there for hours.” I smiled. “We may have hit on something, Mr. Carlson. We continued to talk about his issues and I finally got him to sit in the chair. At the end of the session, Renata sent in my last “red-zone” patient. Mr. Leamington ambled in smoking a cigarette, even though the reason he had come to see me originally was that he wanted to quit smoking. “I thought we agreed that you wouldn’t smoke in here, Mr. Leamington.” “I’m sorry,” He said. “It’s just I couldn’t control myself. It seems as if my hands have a mind of their own. I understand,” I said. “What thought comes into your mind, just before you pull out the cigarette?” “Nothing, doctor.” “I know you think there’s nothing. But every action has a thought that precedes it. Okay, what time did you start smoking this morning?” “I started as soon as I got up -- about twelve. I do shift-work.” “Okay, now go back in your mind. You have just awoken. What are you thinking?” He closed his eyes for a moment then opened them quickly. “I’m thinking about my girlfriend dumping me. It made me mad.” “So perhaps you felt that the cigarette would help you feel better. Is that correct?” He thought again. “Yes, I think you’re right.” “Good work, I think we’re onto something.” He smiled broadly. I gave Mr. Leamington some other tactics he could try then ended the session. After he left, I tried to figure out which of my patients had slashed my tires.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Time-frame of the crime    \n   – The doctor arrived at 10:00, went across the road for a latte and came back about 10:30.  \n   – All four tyres were cut sometime during that 30-minute interval.\n\n2. Who could physically have been in the street at that hour?  \n   – None of the four “red-zone” patients had been given appointments yet; only someone who turned up unexpectedly could have been outside at 10-10:30.  \n   – Therefore we must look for evidence that one of the patients was in the neighbourhood very early, un- announced.\n\n3. Motive / attitude shown in the sessions  \n   • Mrs Roberts – frustrated but turns optimistic, no sign of real hostility.  \n   • Mr Carlson – angry but will not touch any dirty object; he recoils even from a clean office wall. A germ-phobe is unlikely to crouch in a gutter and slash four filthy tyres.  \n   • Mr Leamington – says he did not wake up until 12 o’clock (after the crime); his shift-work alibi puts him miles away.  \n   • Randy Peters – openly disturbed by dreams in which the doctor is the frightening figure; he admits the dream “upset me a great deal,” i.e. strong subconscious hostility.\n\n4. Opportunity clues hidden in the dialogue  \n   – Randy claims he “lost my contacts, doc,” so he is half-blind and must “take a taxi home.”  \n   – Yet seconds later he bends down, gathers every scattered pen and drops them neatly back into the holder – something very hard to do while practically blind.  \n   – The simplest explanation: he can in fact see; the “lost contacts” story is a hastily invented excuse for the fact that he arrived at the office without driving (he could not use his own car – it is still parked somewhere near the scene of the vandalism, or he dropped a lens while slashing the tyres).  \n   – Losing hard plastic lenses while bending over an automobile wheel is common – the story fits the act of cutting tyres perfectly.\n\n5. Putting it together  \n   – Randy arrives early, brooding over the “masked man” who resembles the doctor.  \n   – Seeing the doctor leave for coffee, his anger flares; he slips a small knife from his pocket and slashes all four tyres. While bent over a wheel he dislodges at least one contact lens and cannot find it.  \n   – Realising he now has no corrective lenses, he hails a taxi, returns later for the hastily arranged session and pretends he “lost” his contacts earlier that morning.  \n   – The other three patients either have a solid alibi (Leamington), a powerful practical inhibition (Carlson) or no real hostility (Roberts).\n\nTherefore the only person who had both motive and feasible opportunity – and who accidentally supplied the incriminating clue – is Randy Peters.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMrs. Roberts, Randy Peters, Mr. Carlson, Mr. Leamington\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nRandy Peters\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAt about 10:05 Randy Peters arrived in front of the psychologist’s building, angry after another night of nightmares in which the doctor had chased him.  \nHe saw the doctor leave for his customary morning coffee, realised the street was empty and vented his rage on the doctor’s car, slashing all four tyres with a pocket-knife. While crouching beside a wheel one of his hard contact lenses popped out and was lost in the gutter; without it he could not drive his own car safely.  \nHe walked to the kerb, flagged down a taxi and went home to fetch an old pair of glasses, then returned for the session that the secretary had meanwhile arranged. To explain his lack of glasses and the taxi he told the doctor, “Lost my contacts, doc,” and pretended he could barely see.  \nUnfortunately for him, when he knocked over the pen-holder he reflexively bent down and picked up the scattered pens with the speed and accuracy of someone who can in fact see quite well, betraying his story.  \nThe subconscious hostility revealed in his dream, the false blindness and his presence in the street early in the morning together point unambiguously to Randy Peters as the tyre-slasher.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mrs. Roberts – Although annoyed at slow progress, she becomes cheerful during the session and shows no serious animosity. Nothing links her to the crime scene, and her size would have made a quick, unnoticed attack on four tyres difficult.\n\n• Mr. Carlson – His extreme germ phobia keeps him from touching even a clean chair or wall; he would not willingly grab dirty rubber tyres or risk oily pavement. No evidence places him outside the office before his appointment.\n\n• Mr. Leamington – States (and his shift-work routine corroborates) that he did not wake up until noon, an hour and a half after the tyres were slashed, eliminating any possible opportunity.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Yes, he was unhappy with my therapy, but he wouldn’t have been able to cut the tires due to his missing contacts.

      "outcome": "My first thought was that it might be Mrs. Roberts. She seemed to blame me for her lack of success in weight management. However, she also said she couldn’t bend. That would mean she wouldn’t have been able to slash the tires. It’s not Mrs. Johnson.\nNext, I figured it could be Mr. Carlson. He was unhappy because I hadn’t been able to help get rid of his phobia. However, he’s so worried about germs that he would never go near my dusty Dodge. It’s not Mr. Carlson.\nCould it be Mr. Leamington? He was angry and said sometimes his hands have a mind of their own. But my tires were slashed at ten-thirty and Mr. Leamington didn’t get up until twelve. It isn’t this man\nI had originally eliminated Randy Peters. Yes, he was unhappy with my therapy, but he wouldn’t have been able to cut the tires due to his missing contacts. When he knocked over my penholder and was able to quickly put all the pens back, I knew he had been pulling the wool over my eyes and that he could see. It is Randy Peters\nLater I confronted the man. He confessed and agreed that he and I would work together to help him get over his anger reactions."
