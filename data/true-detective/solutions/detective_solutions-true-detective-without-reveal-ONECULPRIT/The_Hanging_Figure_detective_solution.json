    "full_text": "Forest View House was an isolated mansion owned by an elderly man named Mr. Howard Peters. One wild, autumn night, Mr. Peters was entertaining guests and in the small hours of the morning screams awoke the occupants of the house. Miss Lucy Smith had looked out of her bedroom window and seen the limp form of Mr. Peters hanging from one of the garden trees and started to scream. Everyone rushed out to the hanging figure. After staring at it for several minutes however, they could see that it was not Mr. Peters himself but an old first aid dummy dressed in his clothes. The confused party made their way back to the house only to discover that a priceless painting had been stolen while they were outside. Since the dummy and its clothing had all been taken from the house it stood to reason that the perpetrator was someone at Forest View. The matter was made more sinister by the fact that all four guests were beneficiaries in their host’s will. Mr. Peters telephoned for the police and an Inspector, a rake thin man named Alan Jefferies, duly arrived and promptly dropped down onto the nearest chair as though the walk from his car to the door of the house had exhausted him. The Inspector displayed his ID badge to the satisfaction of everyone except Dale whose poor vision compelled him to push forward to see properly and so tread on the Inspector’s foot in the process. “Well,” said Jefferies, after he had ascertained that he did not have to add a hospital visit to the already eventful morning, “I think someone should explain to me why you are all gathered here.” “It’s like this,” Mr. Peters began. “I wanted my four closest friends to gather here for the weekend as I had business to discuss with them. They are Daisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith and Iain Potts. Daisy is my niece and she resides with me permanently; the others arrived by train yesterday evening. We all had dinner together, during which I revealed some changes to my will, and then we all retired to bed.” “What was the gist of these changes?” Inspector Jefferies broke in. “That there is no longer a fortune to be left to my four beneficiaries, at least not a very significant one, due to some bad investments I made. It was in the room where we had dinner that the missing painting was usually kept.” “Continue,” the Inspector said, noting that all the guests bristled visibly at the mention of their damaged fortunes. “Why is everyone so concerned about this painting? It’s not that valuable is it?” Lucy asked. “Very valuable, my dear,” Mr. Peters muttered. “Well,” Lucy went on, “it doesn’t seem very fair to eliminate our inheritances when you own a pricy bit of art. Why didn’t anyone tell me about it?” “You went to the bathroom,” Daisy explained to Lucy. “You weren’t there when Uncle told us about the painting. It was only a passing remark as it doesn’t affect the inheritance since it’s bequeathed to the local first aid school in Uncle’s will.” “I used to do volunteer work there,” Mr. Peters explained. “That’s why I have some equipment here in the house including the dummy that was used in this awful affair.” “I’ve been led to understand that the house was roused by Lucy’s screams,” the Inspector said. “That’s right,” Lucy replied. “I had to get up at two in the morning to take some tablets.” “Were the other guests aware of that?” Inspector Jefferies asked. “Yes they were. My windows look out onto the garden and I saw what I thought was poor Howard, murdered. I rushed out and one by one everyone else must have stumbled out of their rooms and followed to see what the matter was. I had only been staring at that frightful thing for a couple of minutes when Daisy came up behind me, Dale ran up next. It was very dark out there and all of a sudden we heard a yell and a crash. It turned out that Iain had tripped over one of the ropes used to secure what we now know was a dummy. That brought us all to our senses and we made our way back to the house.” Inspector Jefferies looked over at a man waving shyly at him from the couch with one hand and nursing his leg with the other. “Hurt badly?” Inspector Jefferies asked “Very, I’m afraid,” Iain said sadly. “Excellent,” the Inspector said, apparently unaware of the surprise in the people around him, “who discovered that it was not a real body?” “It was Dale who first made us aware of that,” Daisy replied. “We all thought it was real. It was too dark to get a clear look at the features.” “Mr. Peters, where were you during all this commotion?” Inspector Jefferies asked. “As I am rather infirm, it took me a while to get myself out of bed and down the stairs. By the time I came down everyone had returned. The nearest phone is in the dining room and so I went in there to call the police.” “We will proceed into that room Mr. Peters if you please, everyone else too,” Inspector Jefferies instructed. As soon as the group entered the dining room a small spaniel tied up on the far side of the table began to yap frantically. He showed no sign of stopping until Daisy, who was the owner of the little creature, went over and petted him until he reluctantly quietened down. “For goodness sake, Daisy, from the moment I woke up all I could hear was that canine racket and when I came in here to call the police I could hardly hear myself over his noise. He flies into a frenzy when he sees anyone other than you, you need to get him trained, there’s not a day goes by that-” “Uncle, the policeman doesn’t want to know about your domestic troubles,” Daisy said. “Oh, doesn’t he? Well, as I waited for the call to be answered I looked up at the wall here and that was when I saw that the painting had been stolen. Now, Inspector,” said Mr. Peters, “will you search the rooms?” “No,” said the Inspector, “no, I don’t think I would like to do that, your house is exceptionally large.” “-but” “Besides,” the Inspector continued, “I don’t need to search the house to tell you who took the painting.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  List the hard facts.\n   •  The painting hung in the dining-room, the very room in which the spaniel was tied.  \n   •  The spaniel “flies into a frenzy when he sees anyone other than Daisy,” but is quiet with Daisy.  \n   •  Mr Peters says that from the moment he awoke (after the garden episode) the dog had been yapping constantly.  \n   •  No one claims to have been awakened earlier by the dog; Lucy was able to go to the bathroom and look out of her window in perfect quiet.\n   •  Therefore, while the picture was actually taken the spaniel was NOT barking; otherwise everyone in the silent house would have heard it.\n   •  The only person who could approach the dining-room without setting the dog howling is Daisy.\n\n2.  Consider motive.\n   •  All four guests have just learnt that their cash inheritances have virtually vanished.  \n   •  However, the painting is “very valuable” and it is not coming to them; it is willed to a first-aid school.  \n   •  Daisy, Mr Peters’s niece, lives in the house and therefore has the best chance both to know the exact value of the painting and to spirit it away unnoticed.\n\n3.  Consider opportunity and the dummy trick.\n   •  The culprit had to (a) remove the dummy and Mr Peters’s clothes from the house, (b) hang it in the garden, and (c) remove the picture—all without being seen.  \n   •  A permanent resident who moves freely about the house (and is not challenged by the dog) could easily do all three jobs before 2 a.m. when Lucy happened to look out of her window.  \n   •  When Lucy screamed and everyone rushed out, Daisy merely had to follow the others a minute or two later, giving her time to make sure the picture was safely hidden.\n\n4.  Logical deduction.\n   •  If anybody except Daisy had entered the dining-room, the spaniel would have set up a furious barking, waking the light sleeper Lucy (who was up for tablets) and probably the whole house.  \n   •  Because no one heard barking until after the theft, the thief must be the one person who does not provoke the dog—Daisy.  \n   •  This single fact is enough for Inspector Jefferies to announce the culprit without searching a “large” house.\n\nHence the thief is Daisy Morris.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDaisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith, Iain Potts\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDaisy Morris\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter dinner Daisy learnt that the cash inheritance was gone and that the only thing of real value left to her uncle was the painting—already promised to a first-aid school.  Deciding to secure at least that fortune for herself, she formed a simple plan.\n\nDuring the night, while the others slept, she removed the first-aid dummy from a store-room, dressed it in her uncle’s clothes, carried it outside, and hanged it from a tree that could be seen from Lucy’s window.  Being the dog’s mistress, she could slip in and out of the dining-room in perfect silence; the spaniel merely wagged its tail and watched.\n\nBefore 2 a.m. she entered the dining-room, unhung the valuable painting, hid it in a safe place (probably outside or in her own suite) and then went back upstairs.\n\nAt two o’clock Lucy got up, saw the “body,” and screamed.  The entire household poured outside.  Daisy waited just long enough to deal with the picture, then followed Lucy and the others to the garden.  With everyone outside, no one noticed the missing painting.\n\nWhen they returned Mr Peters, delayed by infirmity, phoned the police from the dining-room.  The dog, now confronted by its master and later by Inspector Jefferies, barked madly at the strangers.  Jefferies quickly realised that if the dog reacted like that to everyone except Daisy, only she could have approached it and removed the picture in silence.  That is why he could identify the thief without searching the mansion.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Dale Clark – The spaniel would have created an uproar had Dale approached the dining-room, awakening the house long before Lucy’s scream.  His poor eyesight also makes the delicate removal of the picture at night improbable.  \n\n•  Lucy Smith – Lucy’s window overlooks the garden, so she clearly did not set up the dummy after she went to bed; she would have seen herself doing it.  The dog would have barked at her as well.  \n\n•  Iain Potts – Iain’s badly injured leg, caused by tripping over the dummy’s rope, shows he had not rehearsed the scene and did not know where the ropes were.  As with the others the dog would have sounded the alarm if he had stolen the painting.  \n\nTherefore only Daisy, the dog’s beloved mistress, had both the opportunity to work unobserved and the motive to steal the valuable painting, making her the sole culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "“It is clear to me,” the Inspector said, “that this revelation during dinner was a great blow to all four guests staying here. During dinner the conversation turns to the valuable painting and someone decides to steal it. It couldn’t have been Lucy since she was not in the room when this painting was discussed.\nThe thief knew an attempt must be made without delay. They could have sneaked downstairs and taken the painting during the night if it were not for the spaniel that barks incessantly, it would certainly wake the household if an attempt were made and give the game away. The fact that the spaniel was barking when the painting was taken proves that it was not Daisy who stole it.”\n“If I had come into the dining room my puppy would never have made a sound,” Daisy said as she patted the dog.\n“The thief set up a distraction on the lawn,” the Inspector continued,” something sufficiently terrifying to get everyone to run out of the house with no thought for anything but the apparent murder. I suspect a little bit of sinister revenge played a part in this choice of distraction since the thief was angry with Mr. Peters.\nEveryone knew that Lucy had to get out of bed and take her medicine during the night and so the dummy was placed on the lawn underneath her window in order that she would give an alarm when she saw it.\nAs we know when the alarm came everyone rushed out, except for Mr. Peters who spent a long time rising from bed. At this point the dog was already barking so the thief had snuck down first and entered the dining room as soon as they heard Lucy’s first scream, knowing that now the dog would be ignored in favour of the distraction on the lawn. The thief had only to take the painting, stash it somewhere in the house where they could get it later and then join the others.\nWhen the party ran out Iain tripped over a guide rope and hurt himself badly, he would never have had this accident if he had been aware of how the dummy was secured.”\n“Hey! I’d never have run and nearly broken my neck as well as twisting my ankle if I’d been able to help it,” Iain whined petulantly.\n“That was my point,” the Inspector said very slowly.\n“Oh, oh I see,” Iain said blushing.\n“Of course,” Inspector Jeffries said as he turned to look at Dale, “that only leaves one person.”\n“What makes you think it was me for sure?” Dale asked with a sly smile.\n“Because you demonstrated your poor eyesight when I showed my ID and yet it was you that apparently first managed to pierce the darkness with your vision and ascertain that the hanging figure was in fact a dummy.”\n“That would have been impossible,” Lucy cried.\n“Indeed it would have,” the Inspector said, “the truth of the matter is that Dale here knew that all along because he was the one that put it there.\nI think a cursory examination of the house will reveal the painting’s hiding place and if the rest of you handle your press interviews over these events sensibly I doubt that you will miss the inheritance money very much after all. Good day to you.”",

He flies into a frenzy when he sees anyone other than you, you need to get him trained, there’s not a day goes by that-” “Uncle, the policeman doesn’t want to know about your domestic troubles,” Daisy said. “Oh, doesn’t he? Well, as I waited for the call to be answered I looked up at the wall here and that was when I saw that the painting had been stolen. Now, Inspector,” said Mr. Peters, “will you search the rooms?” “No,” said the Inspector, “no, I don’t think I would like to do that, your house is exceptionally large.” “-but” “Besides,” the Inspector continued, “I don’t need to search the house to tell you who took the painting.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Daisy Morris; (b) Dale Clark; (c) Iain Potts; (d) Lucy Smith",
      "answer": "(b) Dale Clark",
      "outcome": "“It is clear to me,” the Inspector said, “that this revelation during dinner was a great blow to all four guests staying here. During dinner the conversation turns to the valuable painting and someone decides to steal it. It couldn’t have been Lucy since she was not in the room when this painting was discussed.\nThe thief knew an attempt must be made without delay. They could have sneaked downstairs and taken the painting during the night if it were not for the spaniel that barks incessantly, it would certainly wake the household if an attempt were made and give the game away. The fact that the spaniel was barking when the painting was taken proves that it was not Daisy who stole it.”\n“If I had come into the dining room my puppy would never have made a sound,” Daisy said as she patted the dog.\n“The thief set up a distraction on the lawn,” the Inspector continued,” something sufficiently terrifying to get everyone to run out of the house with no thought for anything but the apparent murder. I suspect a little bit of sinister revenge played a part in this choice of distraction since the thief was angry with Mr. Peters.\nEveryone knew that Lucy had to get out of bed and take her medicine during the night and so the dummy was placed on the lawn underneath her window in order that she would give an alarm when she saw it.\nAs we know when the alarm came everyone rushed out, except for Mr. Peters who spent a long time rising from bed. At this point the dog was already barking so the thief had snuck down first and entered the dining room as soon as they heard Lucy’s first scream, knowing that now the dog would be ignored in favour of the distraction on the lawn. The thief had only to take the painting, stash it somewhere in the house where they could get it later and then join the others.\nWhen the party ran out Iain tripped over a guide rope and hurt himself badly, he would never have had this accident if he had been aware of how the dummy was secured.”\n“Hey! I’d never have run and nearly broken my neck as well as twisting my ankle if I’d been able to help it,” Iain whined petulantly.\n“That was my point,” the Inspector said very slowly.\n“Oh, oh I see,” Iain said blushing.\n“Of course,” Inspector Jeffries said as he turned to look at Dale, “that only leaves one person.”\n“What makes you think it was me for sure?” Dale asked with a sly smile.\n“Because you demonstrated your poor eyesight when I showed my ID and yet it was you that apparently first managed to pierce the darkness with your vision and ascertain that the hanging figure was in fact a dummy.”\n“That would have been impossible,” Lucy cried.\n“Indeed it would have,” the Inspector said, “the truth of the matter is that Dale here knew that all along because he was the one that put it there.\nI think a cursory examination of the house will reveal the painting’s hiding place and if the rest of you handle your press interviews over these events sensibly I doubt that you will miss the inheritance money very much after all. Good day to you.”"
