    "full_text": "It was one of those nasty March days, full of winter bluster and cold early spring rain, and I was feeling out of sorts. Sherlock Holmes was, as far as I then knew, a victim of his tussle with Professor Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland. (You will note that this was before his reappearance as I, Dr. James Watson, have written elsewhere.) I was sadly going through the papers of his cases, hoping to recapture something of the spirit and excitement of his companionship during our days of working on his cases. Or rather, I should put it more modestly, and just say how thrilled I had been to work alongside Holmes, at his unfailing direction. Mrs. Hudson, the housekeeper at 221B Baker Street, had served me delicious hot tea with scones and jam, and I then settled in to reading some old files. A number of them were not yet chronicled, and perhaps I sought to make Holmes come alive for an hour or so while I wrote notes about a case that he and I had worked on together. That was when a knock on the door interrupted my thoughts, and before Mrs. Hudson could introduce the visitor, I saw a charming, rather breathless young woman, about twenty, fashionably dressed, almost bursting through the door, so hurried was she. “You must help me, Mr. Holmes!” She nearly shouted. I tried to set her right, I really did. But each time I opened my mouth, she began again, cutting off speech with her cries for urgent action. “You must come and help! Even now it might be too late,” she cried. In the end, not knowing what I was doing or where we were going, I grabbed my overcoat and, for the sake of the image, an old deerstalker cap that Holmes had abandoned on a hook near the door, rushed out the door with her, leaving an astonished Mrs. Hudson in our wake. “We’ll go to Euston Station, and I’ll explain everything on the train,” she said. And it was with a sense of relief that, good as her word, as soon as we were on the suburban train line, she took a deep breath, prepared to speak and then looked at me closely for the first time. “Odd, you don’t look anything like Sherlock Holmes,” she sputtered. “That’s because I am not Sherlock Holmes,” I said. “I am Dr. James Watson at your service. Holmes and I have explored many cases together, and in his unfortunate absence (for I was still unwilling, despite the evidence, to admit to myself that Holmes might be dead), I will be glad to assist you in any way that I can.” That seemed to comfort her. “Please begin,” I said. “My name is Sheila Ingalls,” she said. “I am the daughter of the Reverend Martin Ingalls of Camden Parish, our destination today. I thought that today was going to be the happiest day of my life, for the announcement of my engagement to Wallace Anders was to be announced this morning.” “I gather it was not announced?” “No. Imagine my feelings when I arrived at the church, following a short morning walk from the parsonage where my father and I reside, and looking at the bulletin board where announcements of intending marriage are posted, saw that Wallace Anders was not listed as engaged to be married to myself!” She then started to cry and pulled from her handbag an enormous handkerchief, which was soon put to strenuous use. “But that isn’t the end of it!” She said. “No?” “No, indeed!” For looking at the notice more closely, I saw that Wallace Anders was engaged to marry Georgette Pelham instead!” “This seems to be nothing more than clerical error,” I said, trying to calm the young woman. “Surely, there is a logical explanation for this mistake?” “If only it were that simple,” she wistfuly replied. Resisting my attempts to question her further, we rode in grim silence for the short distance of the commute to Camden Station, where we were met by her father, the Reverend Marvin Ingalls. He confirmed her story, and soon we were at the church, where I could see for myself what had been made public. Locked behind glass, the bulletin board displayed just one listing, Georgette Pelham to marry Wallace Anders. “Who makes these listings and posts them?” I asked the Reverend Ingalls. “In the absence of a clerk, I do,” he said. “It doesn’t help that I don’t see all that well. The procedure is that a donation is usually given, and then I open the bulletin board box with a key, pin the notice, and then lock the box once again.” “Does anyone else have another key that opens the notice board?” “No. This is the only one, from my office.” He waggled it like a badge of office, which perhaps in a way it was, in that small parish community. “Come to think of it,” he added, “I have a duplicate key at home, in the parsonage.” “When did all this happen?” “It was late last night. Wallace Anders came to the parish office and asked to post the engagement. He was generous, and so I gave him the notice paper to fill out, which he did.” “Did you look at the paper before posting it?” “Only a glance, for I must confess, my eyes are not what they were.” “But that wasn’t your only caller yesterday?” That was a nice note, I thought. Holmes could hardly have done better himself, in anticipating a line of inquiry. “No. Georgette Pelham also came, half an hour later. She came to see the announcement, she said.” “She didn’t want to make an announcement herself?” “That isn’t possible. Only men are permitted to make the announcements, either the prospective bridegroom, or the father of the bride.” “And you had made no announcement?” “None whatever.” “Was Georgette Pelham emotionally distressed?” “No, she was not upset in the least - she seemed quite happy. And that rather surprised me.” “Why, Reverend Ingalls?” “Well, it has long been known in this little town that she wanted to marry Wallace Anders - most people assumed that they would be married one day.” I turned to Sheila Ingalls. “When did Wallace Anders propose?” “It was one week ago. We were playing whist, and he was in a playful mood. I had just played a very skillful hand, if I do say so myself. He said that anyone who played that well should be his partner for life!” “Really?” “Yes, indeed, and everyone heard it. I assented and told Father immediately, of course. And then I said that Wallace should post the engagement. He was somewhat reluctant, saying that his business wasn’t quite self-sufficient, some nonsense of that sort. And finally, last night he told me that he would be posting the engagement announcement which I could not wait to see this morning. And we have this forgery instead!” “Can you help us, Dr. Watson?” “I believe that I can. You did well, Miss Ingalls, to bring it to my personal attention. For I can tell you not only who posted the announcement, but what was the intention in doing so.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who could have physically put the wrong notice into the locked showcase?  \n   •  Whoever filled-in the announcement form before it was pinned up.  \n   •  Anyone who later got hold of the single office key or of the duplicate that lies in the parsonage.\n\n2. Was the showcase opened a second time?  \n   •  The Reverend says he locked it immediately after posting the paper for Mr Anders.  \n   •  When Miss Pelham looked at the board only half an hour later, the case was still locked – the Reverend would certainly have noticed if he had had to unlock it again.  \n   •  In the morning, when Miss Ingalls inspected it, the glass was still locked.  \n   •  Therefore the announcement that everybody saw in the morning must be the very same sheet that was slipped under the glass the previous night.\n\n3. Whose handwriting is on that sheet?  \n   •  By rule, the prospective bridegroom (or the bride’s father) must fill in the form; the Reverend merely hands him a blank and then pins up whatever is written.  \n   •  The only person who wrote on the form in the Reverend’s office last night was Wallace Anders.\n\n4. Could anyone else have altered or replaced the paper afterwards?  \n   •  Only the Reverend and whoever has access to the spare key in the parsonage could have opened the case.  \n   •  Miss Ingalls went straight from the parsonage to the church in the morning and found the wrong notice already there.  \n   •  The Reverend had been surprised by Miss Pelham’s cheerfulness half an hour after he had posted the paper, proving that he himself had not handled the showcase in the meantime.  \n   •  No other person is known to have had either key, nor was the lock forced.\n\n5. Motive.  \n   •  Anders had been noticeably “reluctant” all week to post an engagement to Miss Ingalls.  \n   •  Camden gossip held that Georgette Pelham had long set her cap at him, and she was “quite happy” when she saw the board.  \n   •  The simplest – and only – explanation that fits the physical facts is that Mr Anders never intended to marry Sheila at all; he wrote “Georgette Pelham” on the notice with the deliberate purpose of announcing his engagement to the lady he really wanted.\n\nConclusion: the wrong announcement was not forged after Anders left the office; it is the very document he himself completed.  Hence he, and he alone, is responsible for the substitution.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nWallace Anders, Georgette Pelham, Rev. Martin (“Marvin”) Ingalls, Sheila Ingalls\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nWallace Anders\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  During the evening the Reverend handed a blank engagement form to Wallace Anders.  \n•  Anders, finally acting on his real wish to wed Georgette Pelham, filled in her name, not Sheila Ingalls’, and paid a generous donation to prevent awkward questions.  \n•  The near-sighted Reverend, giving only a perfunctory glance at the paper, assumed it bore his daughter’s name, pinned it inside the glass case and locked it.  \n•  About thirty minutes later Miss Pelham came to the church, looked through the glass, saw her own name beside Anders’s, and left in evident delight.  \n•  The case remained untouched and locked all night.  \n•  Next morning Sheila Ingalls hurried to the church expecting to see her own engagement posted, found the dreadful substitution, and, believing it the work of some forger, rushed to Baker Street for help.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nRev. Ingalls – He merely posted the slip that Mr Anders gave him.  His poor eyesight meant he did not notice what the paper actually said, but he never altered or substituted it.\n\nGeorgette Pelham – She had no opportunity to open the locked showcase; the paper naming her was already in place when she arrived, which is why she appeared so pleased.\n\nSheila Ingalls – She possessed the spare key at the parsonage, but changing the notice would have harmed her own interests.  Moreover, she discovered the wrong notice only after arriving at the church in the morning.\n\nThus all physical evidence and motive point solely to Wallace Anders as the author of the announcement and therefore the culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "As Dr. Watson immediately noticed, Sheila Ingalls is a headstrong young woman who makes unwarranted assumptions - first, that he was Sherlock Holmes! She wanted to marry Wallace Anders, and believed mistakenly that his flattering statement when they were playing cards was really a proposal of marriage. Instead, after a week in which it became clear that Sheila wanted to marry him and had talked herself into believing they were engaged, Anders went ahead and posted the marriage plans with his longtime sweetheart, Georgette Pelham. The Reverend Ingalls had poor eyesight, so he assumed the posting was for his daughter. Georgette’s happy frame of mind was caused by the fact that she saw that Wallace had kept his promise to her, by posting their engagement. Sheila would have had no motive to take the key that was kept at the parsonage and put up the announcement that was posted as she believed that it was going to announce her engagement.\nThat only left Anders, who did offer a sincere apology to Sheila and her father. “But it was the only way that things could turn out right,” he said.",

She came to see the announcement, she said.” “She didn’t want to make an announcement herself?” “That isn’t possible. Only men are permitted to make the announcements, either the prospective bridegroom, or the father of the bride.” “And you had made no announcement?” “None whatever.” “Was Georgette Pelham emotionally distressed?” “No, she was not upset in the least - she seemed quite happy. And that rather surprised me.” “Why, Reverend Ingalls?” “Well, it has long been known in this little town that she wanted to marry Wallace Anders - most people assumed that they would be married one day.” I turned to Sheila Ingalls. “When did Wallace Anders propose?” “It was one week ago. We were playing whist, and he was in a playful mood. I had just played a very skillful hand, if I do say so myself. He said that anyone who played that well should be his partner for life!” “Really?” “Yes, indeed, and everyone heard it. I assented and told Father immediately, of course. And then I said that Wallace should post the engagement. He was somewhat reluctant, saying that his business wasn’t quite self-sufficient, some nonsense of that sort. And finally, last night he told me that he would be posting the engagement announcement which I could not wait to see this morning. And we have this forgery instead!” “Can you help us, Dr. Watson?” “I believe that I can. You did well, Miss Ingalls, to bring it to my personal attention. For I can tell you not only who posted the announcement, but what was the intention in doing so.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Georgette Pelham; (b) Reverend Marvin Ingalls; (c) Sheila Ingalls; (d) Wallace Anders",
      "answer": "(d) Wallace Anders",
      "outcome": "As Dr. Watson immediately noticed, Sheila Ingalls is a headstrong young woman who makes unwarranted assumptions - first, that he was Sherlock Holmes! She wanted to marry Wallace Anders, and believed mistakenly that his flattering statement when they were playing cards was really a proposal of marriage. Instead, after a week in which it became clear that Sheila wanted to marry him and had talked herself into believing they were engaged, Anders went ahead and posted the marriage plans with his longtime sweetheart, Georgette Pelham. The Reverend Ingalls had poor eyesight, so he assumed the posting was for his daughter. Georgette’s happy frame of mind was caused by the fact that she saw that Wallace had kept his promise to her, by posting their engagement. Sheila would have had no motive to take the key that was kept at the parsonage and put up the announcement that was posted as she believed that it was going to announce her engagement.\nThat only left Anders, who did offer a sincere apology to Sheila and her father. “But it was the only way that things could turn out right,” he said."
