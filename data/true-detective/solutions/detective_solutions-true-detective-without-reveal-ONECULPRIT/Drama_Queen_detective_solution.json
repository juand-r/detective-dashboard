    "full_text": "The last thing Rebecca Williams ever expected when she auditioned for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof was to land the part of Maggie “the Cat” Pollitt. But there it was, posted on the corkboard right outside the theater doors: Rebecca’s name, followed by Maggie. “This has got to be some kind of mistake!” Isabelle’s shrieks reverberated through the drafty halls of the theater. “Where is Alfred? I simply won’t stand for this!” She marched into the director’s office and slammed the door behind her. Minutes later Isabelle stormed out of the director’s office, her face streaked with angry tears. “I’ll get you for this,” she hissed at Rebecca. She turned and pushed her way past Madge Anderson, who had just arrived, and exited the theater. “Wow,” Madge said, looking over the cast list. “Congratulations, Rebecca.” Rebecca blushed. “Thanks.” Madge smiled. “Looks like you’ve upset the balance of power around here.” “I didn’t mean to.” Madge laughed. “Don’t worry about it, Rebecca. Isabelle’s had the lead in the last three productions. It’s time for her to come back down to earth and play a supporting role.” Suddenly, the door swung open and James Fennimore stalked in, wearing his work clothes: blue coveralls and a hat that said Al’s Body shop. His eyes were narrowed as he approached the list on the door. “I don’t believe it,” he said, shaking his head. “What don’t you believe?” Madge asked. “This newbie here got the part of Maggie! Isabelle called me at the shop, crying and insisting I come by here and see for myself.” “So? She earned the part, James. It would be boring if the same people always got the big roles over and over. We would lose attendance.” “All you ever think about is making money!” “That’s not true, James, and you know it. We’re non-profit. Without the revenue from ticket-sales, we don’t put on more plays. It’s that simple.” “This is so bogus. Isabelle deserved that part. If anyone around here actually cared about talent and art, then she would have gotten the part.” “Stop it, James. We all know how you feel about Isabelle, but it’s not fair to Rebecca to suggest that she can’t perform Maggie just as well as Isabelle can.” “Well, I guess we won’t know until the time comes, now will we?” James’s jaw tightened as he turned towards Rebecca. “But listen here. I’m playing the part of Brick, so I’ll be performing opposite you. You’d better not screw this up.” “I won’t. I promise,” Rebecca said. “I’ll do my best.” “Of course you will,” Madge said. “You’d better do more than that,” James said. “You’d better be great. Or I’m never setting foot in this theater again. You hear that Madge? Good luck filling my shoes if I leave.” James spun around and walked out. “What a mess,” Madge moaned. “It’s so hard to get decent men in community theater. If James leaves, I don’t know who we’ll find to take his place.” “I’m sorry,” Rebecca said. “Maybe I should go talk to Mr. Cooper and tell him to give Isabelle the part.” “Everything will be just fine, Rebecca. Don’t give up your part. Isabelle will just have to get over herself. Now take your script and go learn your lines.” Rebecca took a script from the pile on a nearby card table and smiled weakly at Madge. “Here goes nothing.” Rehearsals began the next week. As a director, Alfred Cooper was intimidating: “I expect everyone to be at their best at every rehearsal. I also expect you to always on time. Imagine that each rehearsal is an actual performance. Do not disappoint me or your audience by being late or sloppy.” “He’s pretty demanding,” Rebecca whispered to Madge after Mr. Cooper’s speech. “He just expects you to do your best, and not waste anyone’s time. We all have to rely on each other for a successful performance. Are you still up for this?” “Yes, of course,” Rebecca said. She glanced over at James and Isabelle, who were whispering together. Isabelle glowered at her, and Rebecca quickly turned away. “She sure doesn’t like me.” “She doesn’t like anyone who’s competition. Just remember that Mr. Cooper gave you the part, so he obviously thinks you’re the best one for it.” They began reading lines and working on blocking. After rehearsal was over, Rebecca went backstage to get her things. She stopped and stood perfectly still when she heard Isabelle and James talking in the wings. “I told Mr. Cooper that it’s not fair! Her Maggie isn’t nearly as good as mine would be. All he said was that she was doing great and that as long as she doesn’t flake out and miss rehearsal then she gets to keep the part. It’s so unfair!” Isabelle looked over and caught Rebecca staring at her. “I hate you,” she whispered. Rebecca turned around quickly and left. The next day Rebecca took her script with her to work. In the afternoon she was surprised to look up and see Madge walk in. “What a nice surprise! Are you a patient of Dr. Green?” Rebecca asked. “Actually I am, but that’s not why I stopped by. My car got a flat tire and since I’m hopeless with anything mechanical, I don’t know how to change it. Luckily I was nearby and was able to make it to the parking lot. I called my husband to come and change the tire. I was wondering if I could wait inside here since it’s so cold outside.” “Of course you can,” Rebecca said. “Look, Rebecca,” Madge said. “I’ve talked to Mr. Cooper about Isabelle. He agrees that she’s been a real pain. He even admits that he almost wishes he’d given her the part of Maggie so she’d stop causing trouble. Sometimes I almost agree.” “Oh.” “No, wait, I’m not finished. He said that even though it would have been easier to give her the part, never has he for a moment regretted giving it to you. He said if he had to go back and do it over, he wouldn’t change a thing.” Rebecca sighed. “Thanks, Madge. I just wish Isabelle didn’t hate me so much.” “Don’t worry about Isabelle. She’s just moody because she hates her job at the bakery so much, and she takes it out on everyone around her. She’ll probably be in bad a mood tonight since she works all afternoon, but just ignore it.” Madge left as soon as her tire was changed. When the workday was finally over, Rebecca headed out to her car. She had just enough time to make it to rehearsal. She got into her car and turned the key, but nothing happened. She tried a few more times, but the car still wouldn’t start. Panicked, Rebecca called her car service. When he arrived, the service member opened her hood. “Looks like someone disconnected your battery,” he said, hooking the cables back up. “Thank you,” Rebecca said, jumping into the car. She sped over to the theater and ran inside. Alfred Cooper was standing with his hands on his hips. James, Isabelle and Madge were running lines. They all looked up when Rebecca ran in. “Nice of you to join us, Rebecca,” Mr. Cooper said. “But if you can’t take your commitment seriously, then I’m sure we can find someone else who can.” “No, please Mr. Cooper,” Rebecca said. “Someone disconnected the battery to my car while I was at work. I was set up!” Isabelle scoffed. “Oh sure, Rebecca. Like we’re going to believe that.” “No, it’s true!” Rebecca said. “And no matter what some of you think, I am definitely committed to being in this play. In fact, I’ll prove it by exposing the person who did this to me.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What crime has to be solved?  \n   Someone opened Rebecca’s hood while her car was parked outside her workplace in the afternoon and simply unclipped the battery leads so the engine would not start.  \n   The culprit therefore had to:\n   • know where Rebecca worked,  \n   • be in (or have access to) that car-park that afternoon,  \n   • have a motive for wanting Rebecca to arrive late (and possibly be fired from the role),  \n   • be able to do a very quick, very easy piece of “mechanical” sabotage.\n\n2. Motive analysis  \n   • Isabelle – furious at losing the part. Getting Rebecca replaced would give Isabelle the part and keep her boyfriend James happy. Clear motive.  \n   • James Fennimore – equally angry; threatened to quit if Rebecca was not “great”. If Rebecca lost the part, the threat disappears. Clear motive.  \n   • Madge Anderson – apparently Rebecca’s friend, but she has repeatedly said that if James walks out the theatre is “in real trouble”. She also admits that, although she supports Rebecca, it would be “easier” if Isabelle had the role. So Madge, too, has a motive: save the production by giving Isabelle the lead and keeping James.  \n   • Alfred Cooper – no motive; he cast Rebecca and keeps defending the choice.  \n   Because the sabotage could only hurt Rebecca, the culprit must be someone who wants Rebecca out of the way – i.e. Isabelle, James or Madge.\n\n3. Opportunity / alibis  \n   • Isabelle – is said to be “working all afternoon at the bakery” on the very day of the sabotage (Madge herself supplies that information: “She’ll probably be in a bad mood tonight since she works all afternoon”). Retail bakery jobs usually keep employees busy and in public view. This gives Isabelle a practical alibi for the exact slice of time when the battery was disconnected.  \n   • James – is at Al’s Body Shop. He could in theory slip away, but we are given no indication that he left work, and no link that puts him anywhere near Rebecca’s office.  \n   • Madge – conveniently turns up at Rebecca’s workplace that very afternoon claiming a “flat tyre”, asks to wait inside and then leaves again once her husband arrives. That places Madge (and her car with its hood up) in the same small parking lot, right next to Rebecca’s car, at precisely the right time. She therefore had both presence and privacy to raise a hood and fiddle with a battery cable.  \n   Note the extra irony: Madge insists, “I’m hopeless with anything mechanical,” yet disconnecting a battery cable is about the simplest mechanical act there is – it takes a few seconds and no tools.\n\n4. Physical / behavioural clues  \n   • The sabotage is trivial: lift hood, pull off terminal, close hood. Someone who pretends ignorance about cars (“hopeless with anything mechanical”) is over-doing the denial – classic misdirection.  \n   • Madge’s “flat tyre” is awfully convenient. A self-inflicted puncture would give her a perfect pretext to park, raise a hood or kneel by a wheel without looking suspicious.  \n   • She alone stresses how badly the theatre needs James and how much harm it would do if he quit – thereby giving herself the strongest practical reason to sacrifice Rebecca for the greater good of the troupe.  \n   • Immediately before leaving the office she also feeds Rebecca a reassuring story (“Mr. Cooper wouldn’t change a thing”), lulling the victim into a false sense of security.\n\n5. Process of elimination  \n   Isabelle – strongest motive but solid alibi (working).  \n   James – strong motive but no demonstrated opportunity.  \n   Madge – sufficient motive, proven opportunity, behaviour that fits the method, plus her convenient mechanical “ignorance” is suspicious.  \n   Therefore the only person who ticks every box is Madge Anderson. \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nIsabelle (lead actress wannabe), James Fennimore, Madge Anderson, Alfred Cooper\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMadge Anderson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nMadge realised that the company could ill afford to lose its only reliable male lead, James Fennimore.  \nJames had threatened to quit if Rebecca “messed up”, and he was already furious that his girlfriend Isabelle had been passed over for the coveted role of Maggie. Madge concluded that the simplest way to calm the storm, keep James on the stage and safeguard the show’s ticket sales was to get Rebecca replaced by Isabelle before rehearsals went much further.\n\nOn the afternoon in question Madge deliberately let air out of (or punctured) one of her own tyres, then drove the short distance to Rebecca’s workplace car-park. Claiming a “flat tyre”, she asked to wait inside the surgery until her husband arrived. While Rebecca was busy at reception and no one was looking, Madge stepped back outside, lifted the hood of Rebecca’s car as if it were her own, pulled a battery cable free and closed the hood again. The whole job took less than a minute.\n\nWhen her husband arrived she had the perfect alibi – people saw her dealing with her own flat. She then drove off, satisfied that Rebecca would be late for rehearsal, incur the director’s wrath and very likely be removed from the cast.  \n\nUnfortunately for Madge, Rebecca managed to summon roadside assistance quickly and still reached the theatre, determined to expose whoever had sabotaged her car. The constellation of clues – Madge’s convenient presence, her dubious “hopeless with mechanics” claim, her repeated statements about needing to keep James happy, and Isabelle’s bakery shift – all point straight back to Madge as the saboteur.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nIsabelle: Although she had the strongest emotional motive, she was scheduled for – and assumed to be at – her shift in the bakery all afternoon, giving her no real opportunity to tamper with Rebecca’s car at a medical office across town.\n\nJames Fennimore: He was at work in his blue-collar job at Al’s Body Shop. Nothing in the story places him near Rebecca’s workplace that afternoon, and he did not know where she parks; furthermore, if he had left during shop hours his absence would likely have been noticed.\n\nAlfred Cooper: The director kept defending Rebecca’s casting decision and therefore had no motive whatsoever to sabotage her or jeopardise rehearsal time. He also was presumably at the theatre preparing for rehearsal, not near Rebecca’s car-park.\n\nOnly Madge had motive, opportunity, proximity and behaviour consistent with the sabotage; the others each lack at least one of those essential elements.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Looks like you brought some of it with you, too.” Isabelle gasped and looked down at her shirt. There was a smear of chocolate and powdered sugar on her chest.\n“And I know it wasn’t you, Mr. Cooper, because you told Madge that you wouldn’t change your casting decision even if you could. That only leaves James, who just happens to work at a body shop and has an extensive knowledge of cars.”\nMr. Cooper turned to James. “Well, James?”\nEveryone’s focus was on James. “Oh, fine!” he said. “I did it. I unhooked the cables to Rebecca’s car battery. But I only did it so Rebecca would be kicked out and Isabelle would get her part. I just wanted to make Isabelle happy.”\nMr. Cooper sighed. “Well, what should we do about this, Rebecca? It’s up to you. Should we recast James’s part?”\n“No,” Rebecca said. “Male parts are so hard to cast. But how about free oil changes for the entire cast, James?”\n“Deal,” James said.",

      "mystery_text": "The last thing Rebecca Williams ever expected when she auditioned for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof was to land the part of Maggie “the Cat” Pollitt. But there it was, posted on the corkboard right outside the theater doors: Rebecca’s name, followed by Maggie. “This has got to be some kind of mistake!” Isabelle’s shrieks reverberated through the drafty halls of the theater. “Where is Alfred? I simply won’t stand for this!” She marched into the director’s office and slammed the door behind her. Minutes later Isabelle stormed out of the director’s office, her face streaked with angry tears. “I’ll get you for this,” she hissed at Rebecca. She turned and pushed her way past Madge Anderson, who had just arrived, and exited the theater. “Wow,” Madge said, looking over the cast list. “Congratulations, Rebecca.” Rebecca blushed. “Thanks.” Madge smiled. “Looks like you’ve upset the balance of power around here.” “I didn’t mean to.” Madge laughed. “Don’t worry about it, Rebecca. Isabelle’s had the lead in the last three productions. It’s time for her to come back down to earth and play a supporting role.” Suddenly, the door swung open and James Fennimore stalked in, wearing his work clothes: blue coveralls and a hat that said Al’s Body shop. His eyes were narrowed as he approached the list on the door. “I don’t believe it,” he said, shaking his head. “What don’t you believe?” Madge asked. “This newbie here got the part of Maggie! Isabelle called me at the shop, crying and insisting I come by here and see for myself.” “So? She earned the part, James. It would be boring if the same people always got the big roles over and over. We would lose attendance.” “All you ever think about is making money!” “That’s not true, James, and you know it. We’re non-profit. Without the revenue from ticket-sales, we don’t put on more plays. It’s that simple.” “This is so bogus. Isabelle deserved that part. If anyone around here actually cared about talent and art, then she would have gotten the part.” “Stop it, James. We all know how you feel about Isabelle, but it’s not fair to Rebecca to suggest that she can’t perform Maggie just as well as Isabelle can.” “Well, I guess we won’t know until the time comes, now will we?” James’s jaw tightened as he turned towards Rebecca. “But listen here. I’m playing the part of Brick, so I’ll be performing opposite you. You’d better not screw this up.” “I won’t. I promise,” Rebecca said. “I’ll do my best.” “Of course you will,” Madge said. “You’d better do more than that,” James said. “You’d better be great. Or I’m never setting foot in this theater again. You hear that Madge? Good luck filling my shoes if I leave.” James spun around and walked out. “What a mess,” Madge moaned. “It’s so hard to get decent men in community theater. If James leaves, I don’t know who we’ll find to take his place.” “I’m sorry,” Rebecca said. “Maybe I should go talk to Mr. Cooper and tell him to give Isabelle the part.” “Everything will be just fine, Rebecca. Don’t give up your part. Isabelle will just have to get over herself. Now take your script and go learn your lines.” Rebecca took a script from the pile on a nearby card table and smiled weakly at Madge. “Here goes nothing.” Rehearsals began the next week. As a director, Alfred Cooper was intimidating: “I expect everyone to be at their best at every rehearsal. I also expect you to always on time. Imagine that each rehearsal is an actual performance. Do not disappoint me or your audience by being late or sloppy.” “He’s pretty demanding,” Rebecca whispered to Madge after Mr. Cooper’s speech. “He just expects you to do your best, and not waste anyone’s time. We all have to rely on each other for a successful performance. Are you still up for this?” “Yes, of course,” Rebecca said. She glanced over at James and Isabelle, who were whispering together. Isabelle glowered at her, and Rebecca quickly turned away. “She sure doesn’t like me.” “She doesn’t like anyone who’s competition. Just remember that Mr. Cooper gave you the part, so he obviously thinks you’re the best one for it.” They began reading lines and working on blocking. After rehearsal was over, Rebecca went backstage to get her things. She stopped and stood perfectly still when she heard Isabelle and James talking in the wings. “I told Mr. Cooper that it’s not fair! Her Maggie isn’t nearly as good as mine would be. All he said was that she was doing great and that as long as she doesn’t flake out and miss rehearsal then she gets to keep the part. It’s so unfair!” Isabelle looked over and caught Rebecca staring at her. “I hate you,” she whispered. Rebecca turned around quickly and left. The next day Rebecca took her script with her to work. In the afternoon she was surprised to look up and see Madge walk in. “What a nice surprise! Are you a patient of Dr. Green?” Rebecca asked. “Actually I am, but that’s not why I stopped by. My car got a flat tire and since I’m hopeless with anything mechanical, I don’t know how to change it. Luckily I was nearby and was able to make it to the parking lot. I called my husband to come and change the tire. I was wondering if I could wait inside here since it’s so cold outside.” “Of course you can,” Rebecca said. “Look, Rebecca,” Madge said. “I’ve talked to Mr. Cooper about Isabelle. He agrees that she’s been a real pain. He even admits that he almost wishes he’d given her the part of Maggie so she’d stop causing trouble. Sometimes I almost agree.” “Oh.” “No, wait, I’m not finished. He said that even though it would have been easier to give her the part, never has he for a moment regretted giving it to you. He said if he had to go back and do it over, he wouldn’t change a thing.” Rebecca sighed. “Thanks, Madge. I just wish Isabelle didn’t hate me so much.” “Don’t worry about Isabelle. She’s just moody because she hates her job at the bakery so much, and she takes it out on everyone around her. She’ll probably be in bad a mood tonight since she works all afternoon, but just ignore it.” Madge left as soon as her tire was changed. When the workday was finally over, Rebecca headed out to her car. She had just enough time to make it to rehearsal. She got into her car and turned the key, but nothing happened. She tried a few more times, but the car still wouldn’t start. Panicked, Rebecca called her car service. When he arrived, the service member opened her hood. “Looks like someone disconnected your battery,” he said, hooking the cables back up. “Thank you,” Rebecca said, jumping into the car. She sped over to the theater and ran inside. Alfred Cooper was standing with his hands on his hips. James, Isabelle and Madge were running lines. They all looked up when Rebecca ran in. “Nice of you to join us, Rebecca,” Mr. Cooper said. “But if you can’t take your commitment seriously, then I’m sure we can find someone else who can.” “No, please Mr. Cooper,” Rebecca said. “Someone disconnected the battery to my car while I was at work. I was set up!” Isabelle scoffed. “Oh sure, Rebecca. Like we’re going to believe that.” “No, it’s true!” Rebecca said. “And no matter what some of you think, I am definitely committed to being in this play. In fact, I’ll prove it by exposing the person who did this to me.”",

She said so herself.”\n“That’s definitely true!” Madge said.\nRebecca turned to Isabelle. “And it wasn’t you, Isabelle, because you were working at the bakery all afternoon. Looks like you brought some of it with you, too.” Isabelle gasped and looked down at her shirt. There was a smear of chocolate and powdered sugar on her chest.\n“And I know it wasn’t you, Mr. Cooper, because you told Madge that you wouldn’t change your casting decision even if you could. That only leaves James, who just happens to work at a body shop and has an extensive knowledge of cars.”\nMr. Cooper turned to James. “Well, James?”\nEveryone’s focus was on James. “Oh, fine!” he said. “I did it. I unhooked the cables to Rebecca’s car battery. But I only did it so Rebecca would be kicked out and Isabelle would get her part.
