    "full_text": "Janice Cummings was excited. As the youth director for a new church in Overland Park, Kansas, she would host the church’s first youth sleep over. The little church had been open for six months, and still, the membership was less than 100. Though for the first time, Janice felt the church was coming together as a viable congregation. This pleased her, as the Christmas season was less than a month away. The congregation had purchased an old church building on the outskirts of Overland Park. The building was constructed in the 1930s and very old fashioned by modern standards. An old cemetery behind the churchyard reminded Janice that this institution was from a different time and way of life. The building itself was square-shaped, consisting of the sanctuary with rooms and offices on either side. A small kitchen was tucked away in back of the choir area. And that was it. Tonight, Janice would supervise the youth sleep over. There would be five kids in attendance. Janelle, Heather and Allison would sleep in a classroom on the right side of the sanctuary. Justin and Josh would sleep in a different classroom, across on the left side. Janice would sleep on the couch in the pastor’s office, which was also on the left side of the sanctuary. She knew better, though, than to believe anyone would be sleeping much. Janelle Herbst, 18, was the oldest of the girls. Janelle wore a walking cast on a very painful broken ankle and could barely walk. She was in obvious pain but was determined to spend the night with her friends. Heather Guse, a serious and intense girl, was a year younger and hoped to enroll in seminary next year after graduating from high school. Heather’s lifelong dream was to follow her dad into ministry. Her father was an ordained minister and a friend of Janice’s boss, Pastor Brian Huseby. Justin Paul, 13, was the newest youth member. He seemed nervous, but Janice assumed it was because he didn’t know the older youth and, perhaps, he did not feel well. Justin had undergone sinus surgery recently and experienced discomfort in breathing. Josh Darvin, 15, was a quiet boy who never said much, though he could be rambunctious and was liked by the other kids. Allison, 17, was the mischievous one. Janice made a mental note to keep a close eye on her. At 6:00 p.m., Pastor Brian served communion in the sanctuary. The silver wine chalice and bread tray were the first gifts the new congregation had received and Pastor Brian was fiercely proud of them. They were on permanent display by the speaker’s podium. Communion was served by the intinction method – in which the sacraments are served by dipping the wafer or bread in the communal wine cup. During communion, Janice noticed that Justin had not removed his heavy coat, which was quite baggy on his thin frame. Janice and the kids prepared a snack supper at 7:00 p.m. The rest of the evening, and on until the early morning, was spent in fellowship, game playing and discussing the future of their new church. Josh was in an especially good mood and enjoyed teasing the others with his flashlight. None of the others, including Janice, had remembered to bring a flashlight and Josh wasted no opportunity to remind them of this. But, finally, the young people tired. Around 3:00 a.m., they were finally asleep. At 4:00 a.m. Janice awoke to loud snoring near her on the left side of the sanctuary. A moment later, she thought she heard a faint noise coming from the sanctuary. She suspected a mouse nosing around the communion wafers. Janice briefly considered getting up to take a look around, but knew that it was totally dark in there with no night lights of any kind. After these disruptions, she slept soundly until 8:00 a.m., when Allison woke her. Allison and the other girls had slept in the rooms opposite the boys and Janice. Allison had to cross through the sanctuary to wake Janice and noticed the communion items missing. She mentioned this to Janice after waking her. “Yeah, right,” Janice said, teasingly, remembering Allison as the free spirited one in the group. “I’m serious.” The tone in Allison’s voice told Janice that she was not joking. After checking out the altar, Allison’s claim was confirmed. Janice asked her, “Who took the communion set?” Even the leftover crackers and grape juice were missing. Allison replied, “You’re probably thinking it was me.” “Was it you?” “No, but I was up around 5:00 o’clock to go to the bathroom.” The tiny bathroom was to the right side of the front door – the side of the sanctuary where the girls spent the night. Allison would have exited her room, turned left and walked down the side aisle to the bathroom. This could be accomplished in the dark sanctuary, but with difficulty, as she pointed out. “I even stubbed my toe on the side of a pew. The lower legs are made of metal and it hurts.” Allison showed Janice the fresh, ugly bruise on her right, big toe. She added, “I wouldn’t have hurt my toe against the wall if I was feeling my way along it with my hands.” Janice thought for a moment and then told Allison. “Get everybody together. This is not funny. And I think I know who took the communion set.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. The communion set disappeared sometime between 3 a.m. (when everyone had finally gone to sleep) and 5 a.m. (when Allison crossed the sanctuary to the bathroom).\n\n2. To reach the altar you had to cross an absolutely dark sanctuary – no night-lights at all.  Anyone moving about therefore had only two practical ways to find the way:\n   • grope along the walls and the pew ends, or  \n   • carry a source of light.\n\n3. What we know about each person:\n   • Janice – slept on the couch in the pastor’s office; she was awakened at 4 a.m. by “loud snoring” coming from the boys’ room, so at least one boy was still in that room asleep at 4 a.m.  \n   • Janelle – broken ankle, could “barely walk.”  Impossible for her to hobble through a pitch-dark church, steal a large silver tray and chalice and get back unnoticed.  \n   • Heather – nothing points to her; no light source; would have had to grope the whole way.  \n   • Allison – admits she was up at 5 a.m. and shows a fresh bruise on her toe from crashing into the metal foot of a pew.  The bruise proves she really could not see where she was going; she obviously had no light.  \n   • Justin – recent sinus surgery; the heavy breathing makes him the logical source of the “loud snoring” Janice heard at 4 a.m.  If Justin was snoring then, he was in his sleeping-bag, not in the sanctuary.  He owned no flashlight.  \n   • Josh – “quiet but could be rambunctious” and, crucially, “the others… had forgotten to bring a flashlight and Josh wasted no opportunity to remind them of this.”  Josh is the only person known to have a flashlight, i.e. the only one who could walk around the church without stubbing toes and bumping into things.\n\n4. Allison’s sentence is the decisive clue that triggers Janice’s solution:  \n   “I even stubbed my toe on the side of a pew… I wouldn’t have hurt my toe if I was feeling my way along the wall with my hands.”  \n   Translation: anyone without a light has to grope and gets hurt; the thief, however, got all the way to the altar and back carrying two silver objects without making any noise – he had to have light.  There is only one flashlight in the building, so there is only one possible thief.\n\nTherefore, the logical deduction is that the person with the flashlight, Josh Darvin, stole the communion set while his roommate Justin was the one snoring.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJanice Cummings, Janelle Herbst, Heather Guse, Allison (surname not given), Justin Paul, Josh Darvin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJosh Darvin\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nSometime after 3 a.m., Josh Darvin woke up.  His roommate Justin, whose recent sinus surgery made him breathe noisily, was soon snoring loudly – the noise Janice heard at 4 a.m.  Taking advantage of the fact that everyone else was asleep, Josh picked up his prized flashlight, slipped into the sanctuary, and used the beam to guide him to the altar without bumping into pews.  He removed the silver chalice, the bread tray, and even the leftover grape juice and crackers, carried them back through the side aisle and hid them (most likely in his backpack) in the boys’ classroom.  He then returned to his sleeping-bag and turned the light off.  Because he alone had illumination he could move silently; no one heard him and, unlike Allison an hour later, he did not stub his toe on the pews.  In the morning, the set was found missing and Allison’s comment about stubbing her toe reminded Janice that only Josh possessed the means to walk safely through the pitch-dark church.  Janice therefore immediately realized that Josh had to be the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Janice Cummings – was awakened by snoring and a faint noise at 4 a.m. and went back to sleep; her position also gave her no motive to steal her own church’s first gift.  \n• Janelle Herbst – a broken ankle in a walking cast makes a stealthy trip through a dark sanctuary physically impossible.  \n• Heather Guse – no light source, no motive, and would hardly sabotage the very communion ware she regards as sacred.  \n• Allison – her badly stubbed toe proves she could not see; if she could not avoid a stationary pew, she could not have carried a silver tray and chalice out of the sanctuary without dropping or clanging them.  \n• Justin Paul – his loud snoring at 4 a.m. establishes that he was in his room asleep while the theft occurred; he also had no flashlight.  \nOnly Josh possessed the flashlight necessary for a silent, unharmed trip, giving him the sole practical opportunity to commit the crime.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

But, this is the Lord’s house and He is not to be mocked.” Pausing for a moment, she continued with emphasis, “You drank the blood and ate the body of Christ out of proper context. That is wrong.”\nJosh, now visibly shaken, asked, “What are you going to do?” Janice took a moment before answering. “Nothing,” she said.\n“Nothing?” Josh asked, incredulously. He was used to harsh, unforgiving school administrators. “Why not?”\nJanice smiled a thin smile. She said, “Don’t you remember your Sunday school lessons? It was Jesus who said, “Go and sin no more.”",
