    "full_text": "Carol Ludlow amazed the hospitality industry when she hired troubled teens to work at her restaurant, Desserts on Me. The restaurant took off and she felt happy that she had improved the lives of these young people. The kids didn’t always get along, but Carol thought that by showing them encouragement and kindness, she’d be setting a good example. She gave them each specific responsibilities at the restaurant. Dan was in charge of keeping the restaurant exterior clean and presentable. David, who was her newest hire, kept the kitchen clean, washing dishes and putting away supplies. Teresa was a natural when it came to baking, and Carol entrusted her with the recipes for the cakes and pies. Robert had a talent for management, and Carol often left him in charge when she went out to run errands. One Monday morning, Carol returned from one of those errand runs to find Officer Whitcomb in the dining room of the restaurant, examining her cash register. “Hello, Miss Ludlow. I’m sorry to spring this on you, but your employee Robert called in a theft. Three hundred dollars is missing from your cash register.” Carol raised her eyebrows. “Oh, dear!” “Robert said you left exactly three hundred in there this morning in case any deliveries arrived. When the dairy delivery arrived, Robert came in here to get the money and discovered it missing. He called us immediately, and I only just arrived. Robert said he can hear the front door ring from the kitchen and he didn’t hear it once, other than when I entered. The dairy delivery came to the back, as usual. There’s really only one possibility: the thief must be one of your employees.” Carol felt a lump form in her throat. “You gotta expect problems from kids like these. Sometimes they don’t know what’s right. I’ve told them all to stay in the kitchen. I’ll begin the interviews, and you can press charges when I figure out which of the troublemakers did it.” “No, no, I’ll handle it.” Carol thanked the officer and ushered him out. She told him she’d be in touch if she thought she needed his help. As he left, the door made its usual loud ringing sound. Carol walked into the kitchen to greet her employees. Robert, Teresa, David and Dan all stood silently, waiting for her to yell at them. Carol took a deep breath and said, “I know you’ve all heard about the robbery. We’ll talk about it a little later. Right now, I want to unpack the things I bought while running my errands.” Carol placed the bag of supplies she had bought onto the kitchen counter. She removed the rubber gloves from the bag and placed them into the empty glove holder. Then she took out the towels she had purchased and hung them on the racks in the kitchen. The kids had been messier than normal this week and all of the regular towels were at the cleaners. Carol walked back into the dining room and sat down at one of the tables. As she thought about the missing three hundred dollars, she felt sad. Obviously, one of her employees must have needed the money for something important. She decided she would call in the kids one by one to try to figure out who did it and why. Robert entered first. He had long brown hair and a shiny crystal stud in his ear. “So how did everything go today, Robert?” “Okay. I stayed in the kitchen all morning watchin’ Teresa make that Black Forest Cake. You know how messy she gets. I just wanted to stop her from getting batter everywhere.” “Thanks, Robert.” “I wouldn’t even let her go to the bathroom till she finished. She would have gotten batter everywhere, and I thought it was better to be sure she finished her work before she took any kind of break. The only time I left her alone was when I went out back to greet the dairy deliveryman.” “Well we’ll have to talk about the bathroom thing later, but in the meantime, why don’t you send Teresa out here?” “Sure, Miss L.” A moment later, Teresa came into the dining room, her patched-up jeans and T-shirt covered in flour. “Hi, Miss L.” She reached out to shake Carol’s hand, then looked down at her batter-covered fingers. “Sorry.” “So how are you doing, Teresa?” “Fine. Except Robert didn’t leave me alone all morning, besides going out back to greet the dairy deliveryman. He said I couldn’t go to the bathroom till I finished the cake.” She tossed her long blond hair behind her shoulders. “He kept on making jokes about me being so messy. Why does he do that?” As Teresa spoke, she gestured with her hands and flour puffed off of her clothes. She smiled sheepishly. “Sorry, again.” “That’s okay. I know you’re trying hard.” “Can I go to the bathroom now?” “Sure, honey.” Teresa nodded and rushed away. A few moments later, David entered the dining room wearing his usual baseball cap. His rake-thin body trembled as he sat beside Carol. “I had a terrible day,” he said. “Why?” asked Carol. “I forgot about my skin allergies.” David rubbed his hands. “I accidentally put on rubber gloves when I did the dishes and it made my hands swell up. I could hardly move ’em.” “How do they feel now?” “A little better, but I still can’t move them very well.” She looked at his hands. “Do you want me to call Doc Robbins?” “No, that’s okay. I’m sure they’ll be alright soon.” Carol nodded. “By the way, did Robert, Teresa or Dan talk to you today? Are they making you feel welcome?” A sullen expression appeared on David’s face as he shook his head no. Then he stood up and slowly walked back to the kitchen. Dan sauntered into the dining room next. A tall boy, he had tattoos all over his arms. “Hiya, Miss L. Did you see how amazing the front of the restaurant looks now?” “Yes, very nice, Dan. How long did it take you to clear away all the leaves?” “An hour or so. I had a very difficult time—the wind blew the leaves everywhere. But I finally did it. I’m proud of how neat and tidy it looks now.” “That’s great!” Dan walked back to join the others in the kitchen, and Carol folded her hands on her lap. As she thought about all the answers that her employees had given her, she realized that one of them had given something away. Carol knew who’d stolen the money.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tEstablish facts\n•\tCarol left $300 in the register.  \n•\tThe dining-room door gives a loud ring when it is opened.  \n•\tRobert says he heard that bell only once (when the officer arrived), so nobody went out the front door after the theft.  \n•\tWhen Carol returns she puts a new box of rubber gloves into an “empty glove holder”.  \n   ➔ Before she got back there were no rubber gloves in the kitchen.  \n\n2.\tSummarise each statement  \n•\tRobert – Was in the kitchen watching Teresa; left her only when he went out back to meet the dairy man.  \n•\tTeresa – Confirms Robert’s story; she never got to leave the kitchen.  \n•\tDan – Was outside an hour or so fighting the wind and leaves.  \n•\tDavid – Says he “accidentally put on rubber gloves when I did the dishes and it made my hands swell up.”  \n\n3.\tCheck statements against the known facts  \nThe kitchen had no rubber gloves until Carol returned.  \nTherefore David could not possibly have “put on rubber gloves” that morning. His story is provably false.\n\n4.\tOpportunity  \n•\tDavid was washing dishes in the kitchen, out of Robert’s direct line of sight. He could step into the dining room, lift the cash and come back without triggering the front-door chime.  \n•\tRobert and Teresa were busy at the work table; Dan was outside. No one else had both the opportunity and a false alibi.\n\n5.\tMotive  \nDavid is the newest hire, feels isolated (admits the others are not talking to him) and may need quick money.  \nHe even tries to build an excuse for his hands being stiff, anticipating someone might notice nervous or clenched hands.\n\n6.\tConclusion  \nThe glove story—contradicted by Carol’s “empty glove holder” observation—marks David as the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRobert, Teresa, Dan, David\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDavid\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhile Carol was out, Robert supervised Teresa in the kitchen; Dan worked outside.  \nDavid, washing dishes, realised no one was watching the dining room. He stepped out, opened the cash drawer and pocketed the $300, then slipped back to the sinks. Because he never left by the front door, Robert heard no bell.  \nKnowing that latex makes his skin swell, David invented a story: he had “accidentally” worn rubber gloves and that was why his hands were inflamed. He hoped the tale would distract from any nervous mannerisms and furnish an alibi (“I never left the kitchen—I was doing dishes”).  \nUnfortunately for him, Carol had just replenished an empty glove dispenser; his claim made no sense. That inconsistency revealed him as the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•\tRobert – His movements and Teresa’s account match; he was either in the kitchen or briefly at the rear door. He could not reach the register without Teresa noticing, and the theft had already occurred by the time he went for the dairy money.  \n•\tTeresa – Was under Robert’s constant eye and covered in flour; her only absence was the post-interview bathroom break, long after the cash was found missing.  \n•\tDan – Worked outside the whole period; even if he had come inside, Robert would have heard the front door chime.  \nOnly David’s story conflicts with an established physical fact (there were no gloves), leaving him as the sole plausible culprit. \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

A moment later, Carol entered. A hush filled the room. She smiled. “I know you’re all good kids, but sometimes some of us have problems and need a little extra help. David, I know you told a fib when you said that you had used the rubber gloves to wash the dishes. We didn’t have any.”\nAll eyes turned to David. He stood up, tears rolling down his face.\n“I’m so sorry, Miss Ludlow. I made a mistake. My dad’s unemployed right now and I wanted to give the three hundred to him.”\nAll the other employees whispered amongst themselves.\nCarol gave David a hug. “Thank you for confessing, honey.

      "outcome": "In the kitchen, all the kids stood around arguing—except for David, who sat in the corner rubbing his hands. No one even looked at him.\n“I know who took the dough,” Dan shouted. “Robert. He said he wanted to buy his girlfriend a bottle of perfume this week.”\nTeresa shook her head. “I don’t think so. Robert and I were in the kitchen together all morning, except when he was out back with the dairy deliveryman, right before he discovered the money was missing. He may be mean, but he’s no thief.”\nDan looked at Teresa. “Are you sure you didn’t do it?”\nRobert put his hand on Teresa’s shoulder. “No way. Teresa’s messy, but she wouldn’ta stolen from Miss L. Besides, if she’d used the cash register there’d be batter and flour everywhere from her fingers and clothes. There wern’t no towels, remember?” Robert looked Dan in the face. “Maybe you did it.”\n“I didn’t. I was outside clearing leaves, and if I came in, the door would have rung—you would have heard it.”\nThe tension in the kitchen was rising. Soon all the kids were yelling at one another. A moment later, Carol entered. A hush filled the room. She smiled. “I know you’re all good kids, but sometimes some of us have problems and need a little extra help. David, I know you told a fib when you said that you had used the rubber gloves to wash the dishes. We didn’t have any.”\nAll eyes turned to David. He stood up, tears rolling down his face.\n“I’m so sorry, Miss Ludlow. I made a mistake. My dad’s unemployed right now and I wanted to give the three hundred to him.”\nAll the other employees whispered amongst themselves.\nCarol gave David a hug. “Thank you for confessing, honey. I know that was difficult.”\nDan stepped towards Carol. “Miss L, we’ve been thinking that maybe we could all put our heads together and figure out another way to help David’s dad.”\nCarol’s wide smile lit up the room."
