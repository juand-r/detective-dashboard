    "full_text": "“He's the worst clown ever.” “He's got the worst luck.” “But he's a fantastic kisser!” Whispers buzzed backstage minutes before they started filming the TV show. Distracted stagehands walked by, listening to their earpieces. I was listening to the gossip. “Did he go to clown college?” “He got kicked out.” “Maybe he wasn't funny enough.” “Maybe he was too unlucky!” The stagehands continued ignoring us, until I told the gossipers there was fresh cake in the waiting room. “That cake is for our guest,” one young stage manager said firmly, “and you will treat him with respect.” “It's the way of the world,” joked a comedy writer in a green suit. “No matter where you go, you've got to respect Bumbo.” There was a poster of Bumbo in the hall outside the studio. In it, he wore an enormous frown painted on his face, surrounded by brown greasepaint like an unshaven beard. His ugly face repulsed me (and fascinated me). But even the poster seemed sad, with his black clown's eyes staring helplessly below a torn hat. “Once he got in a cab, and the cab crashed,” the comedy writer continued. “So then he missed his flight to Miami. And then the airplane crashed!” “That's an urban legend,” said a blonde actress. She'd heard the same stories, but over the years she'd met actors who'd actually known Bumbo. “He's bad at math and he's a cheapskate, but he never crashed in a taxi.” She wasn't Bumbo's usual assistant, but they'd hired her to help suggest a circus. She was wearing a top hat, like a ringmaster, and a sparkly black costume. She seemed just as down on the clown as everyone else, even if she had heard that he was a terrific kisser. I was nervous about meeting real show people. It was just yesterday I'd received that frantic phone call about appearing on TV. The bank where I worked raised $10,000 to help poor children -- and they planned to donate it to Bumbo's favorite charity. As a special treat, Bumbo would receive the money on a local variety show that was broadcast to the entire state every Saturday night. I'd represent the bank, standing formally in a suit and tie, while Bumbo would slip, do a somersault, and pretend to drop the suitcase filled with money. They'd prepared green strips of paper that Bumbo would chase after comically, slipping and somersaulting all across the stage. At the end of the skit, I'd hold up a second suitcase -- the one filled with real money -- and Bumbo would sadly shrug his shoulders at the audience. At least, that's what we'd thought was going to happen ... “That's more money than I earned all year,” joked the blonde actress. Her name was Dusty, and she seemed both glamorous and gloomy, wearing heavy makeup hiding the signs of age on her face. She'd been dressed in a leotard for two hours, and her legs looked chilly. “I used to want to be rich and famous. Now I'd settle for just rich.” “Heck, I'd settle for a piece of Bumbo's cake,” said the comedy writer. “I hear it's pretty good.” The comedy writer was always laughing. He was confident and sharp, even while donning a green, pin stripe suit. “Heck, I'd settle for $10,000,” he added, though no one was laughing at his jokes. A few minutes ago when he'd showed up in his green suit, Dusty whispered a catty secret about the writer's wardrobe. In his bedroom closet hung six suits, each one a different shade of green. He thought they'd help people remember his name, which I found out later was -- coincidentally -- Mr. Green. “Stop jabbering,” the stage manager snapped. “The show starts in eight minutes.” Enormous lights pointed towards the empty stage next to us, as even more stagehands began clustering in the wings and behind cameras. He stared at me like he was studying an insect, and then asked “Are you the pie thrower?” No, I explained nervously, I'm from the bank. I hand Bumbo the suitcase of money. “And then you smash a pie into his face,” said the stage manager. “Didn't you read your script?” “Script?” I asked. I'd memorized a statement from the bank, but they hadn't said anything about a pie. “Ouch! Bumbo's not going to like that,” teased Mr. Green. The stage manager seemed irritated. Fighting back anger, he instructed: “Watch for my signal. When I smash my right hand into my left hand … smash the pie into Bumbo's face. Got it?” I nodded nervously. “Don't be scared,” Dusty said. “Bumbo's just like you and me. Except famous.” “And rich,” added Mr. Green. “Why don't you go and talk to him?” “Are you crazy?” Mr. Green answered. “Bumbo's afraid of people! He hides in his dressing room until show time!” Dusty assured me this was just another urban legend, as she pointed me toward the famous clown's dressing room. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Peeking around the corner, I saw that the hallway was empty. All the stagehands had gone to the stage, and the rest of the building looked deserted. But I wasn't sure I was allowed to be there -- even if Dusty said it was OK. Would the clown be frightened by a stranger visiting? Would I be frightened by the visiting clown? Soon my shoes were echoing down the white tile floor. For a moment I just stood outside his door, not sure if I should knock. I checked for the fussy stage manager, but there was no one around, so I took a deep breath, and rapped on the door. It suddenly swung open. I nearly jumped out of my skin. There was that enormous white frown, and cheeks covered with dark brown makeup. But the face didn't move. It just stared at me silently. Not sad, but bored. “Yes?” Bumbo asked. Classical music came from the room behind him. There was a thick Russian novel on a table next to a bottle of vodka. There were makeup dishes in front of the mirror, but the room was completely empty. Bumbo had arrived at the studio already in costume, and though I couldn't be sure, he'd apparently waited alone in his dressing room. “I'm supposed to smash a pie into your face,” I said. “I know,” said Bumbo. “I read the script.” He saw that I was staring at the thick book on his table, and smiled to himself. “Clowns pretend to be stupid,” he said. “But that’s us acting. We're actually very clever.” “Is it difficult to pretend you're stupid?” Bumbo glared back, but didn't speak for a moment. Then he said, “Clowns exist in our mind already.” And now he was really starting to freak me out ... *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* When I stepped out of Bumbo's room, a police officer grabbed me. “Come with me,” he commanded. “But I'm supposed to throw a pie!” “Not any more, you're not,” he said, and led me to two more police officers. Their hair was short, and their uniforms were black. They looked like they never smiled. “Take him upstairs,” the police officer commanded. “No, seriously! I'm supposed to throw a pie!” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* In the back of the TV studio was a second floor conference room where the windows didn't open. It looked out over the parking lot, where I could see two police cars. In the back of the room was the fussy stage manager, insisting that the show had to go on. “I checked with your director,” one of the officers relayed, “and he can delay the taping for another half hour. “And besides,” he said, leaning his face towards the young man. “There's nothing to film. You don't have $10,000 to give to Bumbo. Because somebody stole it!” The stage manager had hidden the suitcase with the money backstage, along with the other suitcase filled with the little green strips of paper. He was going to hand the suitcase with the fake money to Bumbo, and then at the end of the skit, hand the second suitcase to Dusty, who would carry it out to me. But minutes before show time, he'd discovered that there was only one suitcase left. He was sure that he'd secretly tucked both of them into the backstage props closet, and no one knew they were there -- except the stage manager and Dusty. But I was a suspect too, because everyone assumed I'd been carefully watching the bank's money. But I hadn't! And now I'd created a lot of trouble. “Mr. Green knew the money was there, too,” said the stage manager. “He's worked here for years, so he'd know the suitcase had to be in the prop closet before filming. And he'd know it was full of money, since he wrote the skit himself.” “Maybe he needed it to buy more green suits” muttered Dusty. “Anyone else know where the cash was hidden?” asked the police officer. “Bumbo,” said the stage manager. “He always likes to know where his props are.” “And you,” added Bumbo, darkly from the door. We looked up to see him being led in. I expected them to say “trick or treat,” but instead of candy, one of us was going to jail. They frisked Bumbo and the rest of us, but nobody had $10,000 in their pockets. And then the police reviewed the few facts of the case. For the last hour, there'd been a cameraman standing by the prop closet who swore that no one had gone near it. And before that, his camera had been pointed towards the floor, which meant someone in the control booth could see the ground in front of the closet for the previous hour. Exactly one person had entered the closet -- zipping in and out in less than two seconds -- but unfortunately, they couldn't tell who. They'd caught a brief glimpse of a pant leg, but that was useless without the color of the pants, which they couldn't remember. “Heck, it could've been the clown, for all we know,” the policeman complained. “We have to film this show today!” the stage manager complained. But I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Establish the narrow “window of opportunity”.\n   • For the final hour before the theft was discovered a cameraman was literally standing beside the prop-closet – nobody went near it.  \n   • During the previous hour a fixed camera looked at the floor in front of the closet.  In that whole sixty-minute span exactly one person opened the door, darted in, and came out again in under two seconds.  \n   • Therefore the theft had to occur in that single two-second visit.\n\n2.  Work out what that tells us.\n   • Whoever it was already knew which suitcase held the real cash and exactly where it sat: you don’t find, open, and examine a suitcase in two seconds – you simply grab it and run.  \n   • So the thief had to be someone who:  \n        – had been told by the stage-manager where the money was, and  \n        – knew the suitcase was full of cash (i.e. was familiar with the skit).\n\n3.  Check each suspect against the camera clue (a “pant-leg” was momentarily seen).\n   • Dusty: on stage all day in a ring-master leotard and bare, chilly legs – no trousers at all.  The camera saw a trouser-leg, so it cannot have been Dusty.  \n   • Bumbo: came in already wearing full clown costume – huge, gaudy, baggy trousers.  Even in a fleeting glimpse those would be unmistakable; the people in the control-booth would have remembered “the clown’s pants”.  They merely said “a pant-leg” whose colour they couldn’t recall, so it was not Bumbo.  \n   • Stage-manager: he himself put the two suitcases into the closet earlier in the day.  If he had also removed one later, the camera would have recorded two separate visits, but it recorded only one.  Therefore he is ruled out.  \n   • Mr Green: wears ordinary suit trousers – green, but on the black-and-white studio monitor the colour would look grey, which matches the technicians’ statement that they could not remember the colour.  Mr Green is the only person who fits the camera evidence.\n\n4.  Motive.\n   • Mr Green has been grumbling the whole time: “Heck, I’d settle for $10,000.”  He plainly wants money and, as the staff writer, is not well-paid.  No other character expresses such a direct desire for the exact sum that vanished.\n\n5.  Opportunity to hide the loot.\n   • A hundred $100 bills is no thicker than a paperback.  Mr Green habitually carries a hanging garment-bag containing several green suits (the narrator was told there are six of them).  After snatching the cash-filled suitcase he could step into the men’s wardrobe room, transfer the bills to a suit pocket or an inside lining, and hang the garment-bag back on the rack.  When everybody was frisked no one searched his suit-bag, so nothing was found on him.\n\n6.  Deduction.\n   • The only person with motive, knowledge, and the physical traits that match the sole camera glimpse is the comedy writer, Mr Green.  Consequently he must be the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Green, Dusty, Bumbo, Stage-manager\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMr. Green  (the comedy-writer in the green suit)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  Earlier in the day the stage-manager hid both suitcases in the prop closet.  \n•  While the fixed camera was trained on the floor (and before the cameraman took up his post) Mr Green strolled past, opened the closet, and in a single practiced movement seized the suitcase that he himself had written into the skit as containing the real money.  The whole manoeuvre took less than two seconds – exactly what the control-room staff later reported.  \n•  He slipped the suitcase out of sight, ducked into the wardrobe area, removed the neat stack of one-hundred $100 bills, folded it into the inner pocket of a spare green suit that hung in his personal garment-bag, and tossed the now-empty suitcase into a dump bin marked “junk props” (to be retrieved after the show).  \n•  For the next hour a cameraman guarded the closet, so no one else could be blamed for the disappearance.  \n•  When the missing suitcase was noticed Mr Green joined in the general commotion, joking about wanting $10,000 while pretending to be as surprised as anyone.  The police frisked bodies but never examined the bulky garment-bag holding his half-dozen green suits – where the cash still rests.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Dusty: the camera definitely saw a trouser-leg enter the closet; Dusty was wearing a leotard with bare legs, making her impossible.  \n•  Bumbo: his spectacular, multicoloured clown trousers would have been unmistakable on the monitor.  The technicians remembered no such thing, eliminating him.  \n•  Stage-manager: only one visit to the closet was recorded in the relevant hour.  If the stage-manager had removed the case he would have been seen twice – once placing the props earlier, once removing them – so the evidence contradicts his guilt.  \nThus none of them could have carried out the two-second theft; only Mr Green could – and did.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

It suddenly swung open. I nearly jumped out of my skin. There was that enormous white frown, and cheeks covered with dark brown makeup. But the face didn't move. It just stared at me silently. Not sad, but bored. “Yes?” Bumbo asked. Classical music came from the room behind him. There was a thick Russian novel on a table next to a bottle of vodka. There were makeup dishes in front of the mirror, but the room was completely empty. Bumbo had arrived at the studio already in costume, and though I couldn't be sure, he'd apparently waited alone in his dressing room. “I'm supposed to smash a pie into your face,” I said. “I know,” said Bumbo. “I read the script.” He saw that I was staring at the thick book on his table, and smiled to himself. “Clowns pretend to be stupid,” he said. “But that’s us acting. We're actually very clever.” “Is it difficult to pretend you're stupid?” Bumbo glared back, but didn't speak for a moment. Then he said, “Clowns exist in our mind already.” And now he was really starting to freak me out ... *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* When I stepped out of Bumbo's room, a police officer grabbed me. “Come with me,” he commanded. “But I'm supposed to throw a pie!” “Not any more, you're not,” he said, and led me to two more police officers. Their hair was short, and their uniforms were black. They looked like they never smiled. “Take him upstairs,” the police officer commanded. “No, seriously! I'm supposed to throw a pie!” *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* In the back of the TV studio was a second floor conference room where the windows didn't open. It looked out over the parking lot, where I could see two police cars. In the back of the room was the fussy stage manager, insisting that the show had to go on. “I checked with your director,” one of the officers relayed, “and he can delay the taping for another half hour. “And besides,” he said, leaning his face towards the young man. “There's nothing to film. You don't have $10,000 to give to Bumbo. Because somebody stole it!” The stage manager had hidden the suitcase with the money backstage, along with the other suitcase filled with the little green strips of paper. He was going to hand the suitcase with the fake money to Bumbo, and then at the end of the skit, hand the second suitcase to Dusty, who would carry it out to me. But minutes before show time, he'd discovered that there was only one suitcase left. He was sure that he'd secretly tucked both of them into the backstage props closet, and no one knew they were there -- except the stage manager and Dusty. But I was a suspect too, because everyone assumed I'd been carefully watching the bank's money. But I hadn't! And now I'd created a lot of trouble. “Mr. Green knew the money was there, too,” said the stage manager. “He's worked here for years, so he'd know the suitcase had to be in the prop closet before filming. And he'd know it was full of money, since he wrote the skit himself.” “Maybe he needed it to buy more green suits” muttered Dusty. “Anyone else know where the cash was hidden?” asked the police officer. “Bumbo,” said the stage manager. “He always likes to know where his props are.” “And you,” added Bumbo, darkly from the door. We looked up to see him being led in. I expected them to say “trick or treat,” but instead of candy, one of us was going to jail. They frisked Bumbo and the rest of us, but nobody had $10,000 in their pockets. And then the police reviewed the few facts of the case. For the last hour, there'd been a cameraman standing by the prop closet who swore that no one had gone near it. And before that, his camera had been pointed towards the floor, which meant someone in the control booth could see the ground in front of the closet for the previous hour. Exactly one person had entered the closet -- zipping in and out in less than two seconds -- but unfortunately, they couldn't tell who. They'd caught a brief glimpse of a pant leg, but that was useless without the color of the pants, which they couldn't remember. “Heck, it could've been the clown, for all we know,” the policeman complained. “We have to film this show today!” the stage manager complained. But I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

      "mystery_text": "“He's the worst clown ever.” “He's got the worst luck.” “But he's a fantastic kisser!” Whispers buzzed backstage minutes before they started filming the TV show. Distracted stagehands walked by, listening to their earpieces. I was listening to the gossip. “Did he go to clown college?” “He got kicked out.” “Maybe he wasn't funny enough.” “Maybe he was too unlucky!” The stagehands continued ignoring us, until I told the gossipers there was fresh cake in the waiting room. “That cake is for our guest,” one young stage manager said firmly, “and you will treat him with respect.” “It's the way of the world,” joked a comedy writer in a green suit. “No matter where you go, you've got to respect Bumbo.” There was a poster of Bumbo in the hall outside the studio. In it, he wore an enormous frown painted on his face, surrounded by brown greasepaint like an unshaven beard. His ugly face repulsed me (and fascinated me). But even the poster seemed sad, with his black clown's eyes staring helplessly below a torn hat. “Once he got in a cab, and the cab crashed,” the comedy writer continued. “So then he missed his flight to Miami. And then the airplane crashed!” “That's an urban legend,” said a blonde actress. She'd heard the same stories, but over the years she'd met actors who'd actually known Bumbo. “He's bad at math and he's a cheapskate, but he never crashed in a taxi.” She wasn't Bumbo's usual assistant, but they'd hired her to help suggest a circus. She was wearing a top hat, like a ringmaster, and a sparkly black costume. She seemed just as down on the clown as everyone else, even if she had heard that he was a terrific kisser. I was nervous about meeting real show people. It was just yesterday I'd received that frantic phone call about appearing on TV. The bank where I worked raised $10,000 to help poor children -- and they planned to donate it to Bumbo's favorite charity. As a special treat, Bumbo would receive the money on a local variety show that was broadcast to the entire state every Saturday night. I'd represent the bank, standing formally in a suit and tie, while Bumbo would slip, do a somersault, and pretend to drop the suitcase filled with money. They'd prepared green strips of paper that Bumbo would chase after comically, slipping and somersaulting all across the stage. At the end of the skit, I'd hold up a second suitcase -- the one filled with real money -- and Bumbo would sadly shrug his shoulders at the audience. At least, that's what we'd thought was going to happen ... “That's more money than I earned all year,” joked the blonde actress. Her name was Dusty, and she seemed both glamorous and gloomy, wearing heavy makeup hiding the signs of age on her face. She'd been dressed in a leotard for two hours, and her legs looked chilly. “I used to want to be rich and famous. Now I'd settle for just rich.” “Heck, I'd settle for a piece of Bumbo's cake,” said the comedy writer. “I hear it's pretty good.” The comedy writer was always laughing. He was confident and sharp, even while donning a green, pin stripe suit. “Heck, I'd settle for $10,000,” he added, though no one was laughing at his jokes. A few minutes ago when he'd showed up in his green suit, Dusty whispered a catty secret about the writer's wardrobe. In his bedroom closet hung six suits, each one a different shade of green. He thought they'd help people remember his name, which I found out later was -- coincidentally -- Mr. Green. “Stop jabbering,” the stage manager snapped. “The show starts in eight minutes.” Enormous lights pointed towards the empty stage next to us, as even more stagehands began clustering in the wings and behind cameras. He stared at me like he was studying an insect, and then asked “Are you the pie thrower?” No, I explained nervously, I'm from the bank. I hand Bumbo the suitcase of money. “And then you smash a pie into his face,” said the stage manager. “Didn't you read your script?” “Script?” I asked. I'd memorized a statement from the bank, but they hadn't said anything about a pie. “Ouch! Bumbo's not going to like that,” teased Mr. Green. The stage manager seemed irritated. Fighting back anger, he instructed: “Watch for my signal. When I smash my right hand into my left hand … smash the pie into Bumbo's face. Got it?” I nodded nervously. “Don't be scared,” Dusty said. “Bumbo's just like you and me. Except famous.” “And rich,” added Mr. Green. “Why don't you go and talk to him?” “Are you crazy?” Mr. Green answered. “Bumbo's afraid of people! He hides in his dressing room until show time!” Dusty assured me this was just another urban legend, as she pointed me toward the famous clown's dressing room. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Peeking around the corner, I saw that the hallway was empty. All the stagehands had gone to the stage, and the rest of the building looked deserted. But I wasn't sure I was allowed to be there -- even if Dusty said it was OK. Would the clown be frightened by a stranger visiting? Would I be frightened by the visiting clown? Soon my shoes were echoing down the white tile floor.
