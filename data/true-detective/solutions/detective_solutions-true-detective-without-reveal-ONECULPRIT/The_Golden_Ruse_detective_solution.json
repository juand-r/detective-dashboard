    "full_text": "Jealousy and treachery had blighted the Yoxley Art Prize ever since it’s inception, there were even some who said it was cursed. The prize had been set up by the Lord of Yoxley in the late Eighteenth Century in an effort to improve his reputation as a cultural connoisseur. From its outset the event had been dogged by dishonesty, mainly due to the substantial financial reward that accompanied the winning place. Some dark rumors about how the Lord met his death had created sufficient romance to ensure that the competition endured through the years. One summer the group of hopeful artists and four judges gathered together for the competition with a certain sense of foreboding, as though some misadventure was at hand. Robert Yoxley, the modern day possessor of the title and estate, attempted to soothe his guests with a surprise buffet at afternoon tea. “Lovely day, isn’t it, Mr. Reese?” Robert asked the head judge. “It’s a lot of dashed nonsense that’s what it is, young man,” Mr. Reese gruffly replied. “Well, perhaps you would care for some refreshment from the buffet?” “Thank you, no. I’m only here because my wife insists upon it, and I’ve no wish to draw the proceedings out.” “Perhaps it would make it less tiresome if I were to suggest a change in the judging order? As you know only one judge is allowed into the showroom at any one time. You are down to go first, Mr. Reese, but I could put you last and so give you some time to attend the buffet if you wish,” Robert offered. “No, no, no, I don’t want to go last,” said Mr. Reese, “I’d rather get it over with.” “Very well, Sir, I only offered since you are such a distinguished guest. There is champagne laid out in the viewing room for our judges as well. Three very nice exhibits today; one gold, one silver and one bronze.” At that moment, to young Yoxley’s relief, the three other judges approached, they were Miss. Pendlebury, Miss. Jones and Mr. Horgan. “Hello Mr. Yoxley,” they chimed in unison. “We’re glad to finally join you,” Miss. Pendlebury said, “Mr. Horgan was so engrossed in the fresh cream tarts I thought we would never get away.” “You don’t begrudge me, surely, Miss. Pendlebury?” Mr. Horgan asked with a smile. “I begrudge the mess you’ve made of yourself with that cream,” Miss. Pendlebury said disdainfully as she looked at the marks on Mr. Horgan’s jacket. “The sooner all this idiocy is over with the better,” Mr. Reese said sharply, “show me in to the viewing room, Yoxley.” Robert scuttled in front of Mr. Reese as the old man stomped resolutely in the direction of the viewing room. “Well,” Miss. Jones said with a laugh, “I feel quite frightened now, if I take too long over my tea I’m sure Mr. Reese will accuse me of unprofessional behavior in his write up.” “When it comes to unprofessional behavior it would be strange to focus on your tea drinking when you’re dressed the way you are,” Miss. Pendlebury remarked. “What do you mean?” Miss. Jones asked. “A tight fitting dress and no jacket is hardly appropriate attire for an afternoon event. You’re not in the city now, dear.” “Well, I-,” Miss. Jones was cut short in her indignant reply by a tremendous creak from the viewing room. “Good gracious,” said Mr Yoxley as he approached, “that floorboard in the front of the gold exhibit creaks terribly. I must get it fixed. Mr. Reese is finished, Miss. Jones if you want to go in now.” Another terrific creak sounded a few minutes later and Mr. Yoxley ushered Miss. Pendlebury into the viewing room as Miss. Jones came out. “Sorry to leave you until last, Mr. Horgan.” “Oh no trouble, I can have another round of the buffet before I go in.” “No time for that,” said Miss. Pendlebury, as she suddenly appeared behind the little group. “But the board didn’t creak!” Mr. Horgan said. “Off you go,” Miss. Pendlebury snapped, coloring slightly. Later that afternoon the voting took place and it was announced that the gold sculpture was the winning piece. Robert Yoxley was speaking about the solid and robust nature of gold as he lifted the artwork up when it suddenly slipped from his hands and smashed into a thousand pieces at his feet. There was a burst of indignant commotion in the room and talk of high villainy was in the air. Gold, of course, does not shatter and the piece had clearly been switched. Angry suspicion fell upon the judges who had all had private access to the pieces one by one.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe story revolves round just one definite piece of physical evidence – the board that ‘creaks terribly’ whenever anybody steps on the spot directly in front of the gold exhibit.  \nRobert Yoxley and the three judges who were waiting in the corridor could hear that creak every time a judge finished viewing the exhibits and turned to come out again.  \nCreak heard when Mr Reese came out  ➔  he certainly walked right up to (and away from) the gold.  \nCreak heard when Miss Jones came out  ➔  she too went right up to the gold.  \nNo creak at all when Miss Pendlebury came out  ➔  she is the only person who did NOT go right up to the gold.  \nYet at the voting Mrs Pendlebury still felt able to pronounce on the quality of the “gold” and to vote for it.  \nIf she never went near enough even to stand on the board, the only explanation is that she had already examined that same object earlier – i.e. she had smuggled the plaster fake in with her, made the switch while she was still well clear of the board, and then walked straight back to the door.  \nSupporting details  \n• She was the only judge known to be wearing a jacket large enough to conceal a substitute statue. (She herself sneers at Miss Jones for having “no jacket”.)  \n• She comes out very quickly, tells Mr Horgan he has “no time” for another plate of food, and blushes when Horgan notices the missing creak – all signs of nervous haste.  \n• When the fake smashes later, Yoxley immediately thinks of the one person who never stepped on the board and therefore never even looked at what she was judging.  \nTherefore Miss Pendlebury is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Adrian Reese, Miss Clara Jones, Miss Evelyn Pendlebury, Mr. Daniel Horgan\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMiss Evelyn Pendlebury\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEvelyn Pendlebury came to Yoxley Hall with a plan.  Hidden under her well-cut jacket was a lightweight plaster copy of the gold exhibit, finished with a quick-drying metallic paint.  \nWhen her turn in the viewing-room came she kept to the side of the room, well clear of the tell-tale creaking floorboard.  Without ever stepping on it she slipped the real (and very valuable) gold sculpture into her roomy jacket pocket or bag and set the painted plaster fake in its place.  \nBecause she never trod on the board, nobody in the corridor heard the expected groan of timber.  She then hurried out, flustered, and tried to rush Mr Horgan in before anyone could remark on the silence.  \nAt the end of the afternoon Yoxley lifted what everyone took to be solid gold.  The light, brittle imitation slipped and shattered, revealing that the original had been stolen.  \nRemembering that only one exit had been silent – Miss Pendlebury’s – and recalling that she alone had the clothing that could hide a small but heavy object, Yoxley instantly knew who had committed the theft.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMr. Adrian Reese – the board creaked when he left; he examined the gold in the normal way, and had no means of concealing it under his tight-fitting morning coat.  \nMiss Clara Jones – likewise triggered the creak; in a figure-hugging dress with no jacket she had nowhere to hide a substitute or the real piece.  \nMr. Daniel Horgan – was still in the corridor when the silent exit occurred; by the time he entered, the real gold was already gone.  His stained jacket may look untidy but it is not evidence of theft.  \nOnly Miss Pendlebury had both the opportunity (the only silent visit) and the practical means (a jacket to hide the real statue) to switch the exhibits.  All the others had either no opportunity, no means, or both.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
