    "full_text": "Turkeys have excellent hearing. On the first Tuesday of October, when the five-bird flock was out pecking around in the yard behind Farmer MacDougall’s home, they overheard the chilling words that would drive one of them to attempted man-slaughter. Farmer MacDougall and a stranger were standing in front of the open kitchen window of the house, looking out at the turkeys. “We’re only asking for one,” the stranger said. “Surely, you can spare one for the Thanksgiving dinner down at the Mission this year, Farmer MacDougall. It would help feed a number of disadvantaged families.” At the mere mention of the word ‘Thanksgiving’, the big birds in the yard froze. Beaker and Beau stopped gobbling at one another. Red stopped her clipped beak in mid-preen. The newest addition to the flock, a Canadian bird named Leaf, who’d kept to himself for the week he’d been on the farm so far, cocked a beady eye at the window. While Old Leatherneck, twelve years-young and counting, was instantly jolted awake, his blue and red wattles flying as he jerked his head upwards. “Well, I don’t know,” Farmer MacDougall said, scratching the stubble on his chin. “I’m mighty attached to all of my birds. I’ve never really considered them food, except for the eggs, of course. Why, I just don’t-” “Farmer MacDougall, please!” the stranger interrupted. “We know we’re going to be short of turkeys this year – what with the Poultry Mill shutting down. And with the economic recession, monetary donations are way down with which to buy turkeys. We’re only asking you for one!” The five turkeys stared up at Farmer MacDougall, as he looked down at them. He rubbed his jaw, in behind his ear. Normally, he would give some money to the Mission himself. But times were tough. “Weeelll, ookaay, you can have one bird … I guess.” Red fell over in a dead faint, while Beau and Beaker’s tail feathers fanned up in alarm. * “You all know why we’re here,” Beau stated a day later, looking around at the other four turkeys gathered in the barn. A heavy frost had crusted the ground that morning, fall and fall suppers truly in the air now. “Why?” Red asked. Even for a turkey, she was a particularly dumb cluck. “Because we all live here, that’s why,” Beaker said impatiently. “Where else are we going to be?” “No!” Beau retorted, shaking his snood in frustration. “Because Farmer MacDougall is going to kill one of us for the Mission’s Thanksgiving dinner. Our necks are on the line!” “Not mine,” Old Leatherneck crowed. “I’m too old and stringy, wouldn’t make much of a meal.” “Well, as a hen, I’m only half as heavy as you toms,” Red said, primping her feathers, “so I wouldn’t feed many – would I?” “We have to stop Farmer MacDougall,” Beau intoned meaningfully, his eyes darting from one bird to the other, way over to Leaf off by himself in a corner of the barn. “We have to get him before he gets one of us.” There was a general ruckus of yelping and whistling at that pronouncement. The turkeys liked Farmer MacDougall and the way he treated them – lots of mash and grains to eat, plenty of water, straw-lined nooks to roost in and a free range to stretch their legs. But now, with their lives at stake, they realized they had to flock together. “What exactly are you suggesting?” Old Leatherneck queried. “Wait a minute!” Beaker exclaimed. “I’ve got it! I can write to the President and ask for a pardon. He does that, you know, for certain birds.” Beau scoffed. “You can’t write.” “No, but I can peck out a letter on Farmer MacDougall’s computer.” “Good luck with that,” Old Leatherneck stated sourly. “I think what Beau is saying is that Farmer MacDougall has to have an accident,” Leaf suddenly spoke up from across the barn, the first time he had said anything to the other birds. “Right, Beau?” “Exactly,” the big bird beaked. The turkeys looked at one another, their walnut-sized brains working. * It was a cold, foggy morning the second Tuesday in October, when Farmer MacDougall walked out of his house and across the yard to the barn, intent on milking Brown Betty the cow. His eyes were bleary after another sleepless night – the recent turkey promise he’d made to the Mission man was weighing heavily on his mind – and so, as he pulled the barn door open, he failed to notice the rake lying half-buried in the straw just inside the door. He stepped into the barn, onto the steel-pronged end of the leaf and grass-gathering tool. The long, heavy wooden handle of the rake shot upwards and struck him square in the forehead. He dropped like a sack of turkey feed and lay still in the straw. * The five turkeys filed out of their pen at the rear of the barn when Farmer MacDougall was late with their breakfast. They found the old sod-tiller, flat on his back. “Good gravy!” Red yelped. “Farmer MacDougall’s had an accident!” Old Leatherneck stepped forward and examined the rake lying across Farmer MacDougall’s chest, poked around in the straw and came up with a tail feather. “Was no ‘accident’,” the old bird concluded. “We turkeys have powerful legs and long, strong toes, just right for dragging a rake into the proper position. Looks to me like someone tried to get Farmer MacDougall to buy the farm, like we all talked about last week.” He stroked his beard with a wing, gazing at the assembled turkeys, Leaf by himself off to the side. “And I think I can guess who the dirty bird is,” he added. Just as Farmer MacDougall raised his head and gave it a shake. The man groaned, feeling like he’d just had the stuffing knocked out of him.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   – All of the turkeys are worried, but two of them have made it very plain that they probably will NOT be chosen for the Mission:  \n     • Old Leatherneck – “I’m too old and stringy.”  \n     • Red – “As a hen, I’m only half as heavy as you toms.”  \n   – That leaves the three toms who still have a real fear of the axe: Beau, Beaker and the newcomer, Leaf.  \n   – Of those three, Beau and Beaker still talk about other possibilities (letter to the President, etc.); Leaf is the first, and only, bird who comes right out and says Farmer MacDougall “has to have an accident.”  \n\n2. Opportunity  \n   – Any of the birds could have dragged a rake into place during the night, but the story repeatedly tells us that Leaf spends his time apart from the others (“Leaf off by himself in a corner of the barn”).  That gives him many solitary chances to arrange the “accident” without being seen.\n\n3. Physical evidence  \n   – Old Leatherneck finds a single tail-feather near the rake.  \n   – Domestic broad-breasted turkeys such as Beau, Beaker and Red have plain white or buff tail feathers.  \n   – A Canadian (wild-type) turkey like Leaf has a bronze-brown tail with a dark band—totally different and instantly recognisable.  \n   – Because the feather is so obviously of the wild-type, Old Leatherneck can “guess who the dirty bird is” the moment he sees it.\n\n4. Deduction  \n   – Old Leatherneck’s certainty can only rest on a piece of evidence that singles out ONE bird.  A wild-type tail feather does that; nothing else in the barn would.  \n   – Therefore the feather must be Leaf’s, and Leaf must have been the one setting the trap.  \n   – The rake itself is a “leaf-rake,” an extra little verbal wink that points to the same bird.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBeau, Beaker, Red, Old Leatherneck, Leaf\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLeaf   (the Canadian wild turkey, newest member of the flock)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter the barn-yard council, Leaf decided that the safest way to avoid becoming Thanksgiving dinner was to make sure Farmer MacDougall could not give ANY turkey to the Mission.  \nDuring the night before the second Tuesday in October, while the other birds were roosting, Leaf dragged a leaf-and-grass rake from the tool rack and slid it, tines up, under the fresh straw just inside the barn door.  As he manoeuvred the tool he lost a single tail feather, which was buried with the rake under the straw.  \nAt dawn, Farmer MacDougall, still half-asleep, opened the door, stepped on the hidden tines, and the handle smacked him in the forehead, knocking him out.  \nWhen the flock came looking for their delayed breakfast, Old Leatherneck spotted the rake, poked around, found Leaf’s distinctive wild-type tail feather, and at once realised who had set the trap.\n\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Old Leatherneck – No motive; he is “too old and stringy” to be chosen, and he was the one who discovered and identified the tell-tale feather.  \n• Red – Also felt safe because a small hen would not feed many people; moreover the feather found was a tom’s large tail feather, not a hen’s shorter one.  \n• Beaker – Talked about writing to the President; never advocated violence and, as a standard domestic tom, would have left a white/buff tail feather, not the wild-type feather that was found.  \n• Beau – Voiced the danger loudest but, like Beaker, is a domestic tom with plain tail feathers.  Again, the feather at the scene does not match him.\n\nOnly Leaf possessed both the compelling motive, the solitary opportunity, and the unique bronze-brown tail feather that Old Leatherneck found; therefore he – and he alone – is the would-be turkey assassin.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
