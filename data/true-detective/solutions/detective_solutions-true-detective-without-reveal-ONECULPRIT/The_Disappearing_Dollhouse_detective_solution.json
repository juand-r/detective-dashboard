    "full_text": "Fiona Winston was famous, and Fiona Winston was beautiful. Now she was crying on my telephone. Through the tears, I gathered the details. She'd wanted to know who'd stolen her dollhouse. The first clue was her address - a gigantic house on top of a hill, where Fiona was throwing a party. Yesterday she'd sung her newest song on television, and today she'd invited some guests to celebrate. Just 300 of her closest friends. . . Thankfully, the party hadn't begun - it was scheduled for that night. Her enormous lawn was completely empty, with nothing but perfectly trimmed grass and a driveway a half-mile long. It looked expensive, and a little lonely. An iron gate blocked the driveway's entrance, but a security guard emerged from a small shack in front. Fiona's estate was surrounded by a thick hedge of 10-foot high bushes. But could someone sneak over the hedge to steal Fiona's dollhouse? I asked the security guard, who didn't say a word. He just pointed his head towards a security console with over 30 monitors, each showing a different section of the hedge. A light blinked below one, indicating its motion detectors had registered a tiny bird landing on the hedge. Nobody could sneak in without being detected. However, there were five people already inside. When I rang Fiona's doorbell, its chimes played her famous song, and Fiona answered the door in a bright red gown. I recognized her sad face immediately as millions of people would. As she led me into the enormous room, her high-heeled shoes clicked loudly on the marble floor. \"I had my cleaning women come yesterday,” she said, \"so my place could be spotless tonight.” Was there any chance a cleaner could be your thief? She seemed hurt by the question. \"No,” she insisted. \"So many people want to use you when you're famous. And not just for autographs. There's crooked business operatives and industry parasites. . .” \"But I wouldn't let that happen to me. Even when hiring my cleaners, I chose people I could trust. They're friends I've known since childhood. Some are even members of my family.” I felt bad as I started to say that you can't rule out any suspects. But then she gave me another clue. \"It couldn't have been any of them, because the dollhouse was here when I woke up this morning. Then an hour later, it was gone!\" The only thing stolen was Fiona's exotic Russian dollhouse with a lonely history all its own. Princess Katarina had received it 400 years ago, facing her own medieval parasites trying to befriend the famous. A powerful Russian lord assembled a dozen jewel-setters to decorate its eight rooms, each carved out of a rare black wood. Each room was a different color, its walls filled with gorgeous jewels - green emeralds, red rubies, and even sparkly white diamonds. Its huge financial value was matched only by its historic value. Fiona thought it was worth \"at least ten million dollars” -- but she hadn't had it appraised. We cross the marble floor to a tiny den where the dollhouse had been displayed. It had no other exits or windows. Neither did the enormous room we'd just crossed, except for a kitchen on its right, and a wide staircase curling down from the second floor above. A fresh bouquet of unhappy sun-less flowers was resting on the den's floor. I called the guard's shack at the entrance to Fiona's driveway. Was there anyone else who had already left the house? No, the guard replied firmly. I replaced the phone, then told Fiona I had some bad news. \"That means the thief must be one of the four people still in your house. We'll have to figure out who could've stolen your dollhouse. Can you tell me anything about them?\" \"Well first, there's my boyfriend Kyle.” I'd seen his picture in the paper. (There had been a small scandal when late one night he'd crashed his car.) Maybe the reputation he got was unfair, but just being here today also made him a suspect. Could he also be seducing the singer, in order to steal from her? Also in Fiona's house was Lucius Oswald, the chief caterer. He was well respected throughout Hollywood as a brilliant but strange servant to the stars. Lucius arrived that morning on an exotic bicycle from Sweden, and Fiona escorted him to examine the kitchen for his twenty-person catering crew, who were scheduled to arrive that afternoon. I immediately wondered if he had a side business selling the occasional stolen antique! Lucius was hired by suspect #3, a party planner named Julia. She'd become famous herself for being able to organize a party for 300 people overnight. Julia was smart, energetic, and very serious about her career, and when you hired Julia, she'd guarantee a wonderful party with the best caterer in town. But maybe she was secretly bitter after planning hundreds of parties for other people. Everyone there was a glamour-industry professional except one. His name was Reg, and he had dark eyes above thin lips that didn't smile. He acknowledged that part of him didn't even want to be here, saying he felt out of place in the houses of the rich and famous. But when Julia had seen his gorgeous bouquets, she'd insisted he be her party's florist. Reg had dutifully loaded 40 bouquets into his van to decorate all the rooms in Fiona's house. He didn't usually fill orders involving this many bouquets, and he'd obviously feel more comfortable back in his flower shop. But had he grabbed a souvenir? \"I want this solved quickly,” Fiona moaned. \"So do I,” snapped Julia, bringing Lucius and Reg into the room from the kitchen next door. Kyle heard their footsteps echoing across the marble floor, and came down the staircase from the second floor. He had long, glamorous hair, and wore an expensive looking shirt. Seizing the moment, I asked: who was the first person to arrive? The night before, after Fiona's television appearance, she'd had a date with Kyle. She picked him up in her famous red Ferrari and drove him back to her estate. Kyle said in a lazy voice, \"So I've been here since last night.” \"I wasn't,” Julia added. \"I had Reg start delivering the flowers early, and then sent Lucius over to begin preparing the kitchen.” Were you in the kitchen all morning? I asked Lucius. \"A caterer has to know what kind of facilities he has,” Lucius insisted defensively. I have to ask you all a very important question, I told the suspects. Was anyone here carrying anything when they arrived? \"Not me,” said Kyle. \"Just one of my clipboards,” said Julia. \"And your purse!” Kyle challenged. \"Search it!” Julia said sharply, holding her purse open for all of us to see. \"There's no Russian dollhouse in here!\" \"Julia,” I said, \"I'm afraid I'm going to have to search your car.” \"Go ahead!” she said furiously. \"I've got nothing to hide!\" We searched Julia's car, and sure enough, we found nothing inside except another clipboard. As the four suspects stared, I turned and announced: \"I'm ready to identify our thief.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  The thief has to be somebody who was already inside the grounds, because  \n    • the motion–sensing cameras and ten–foot hedge make a break-in from the outside impossible, and  \n    • the guard swears nobody has driven out since the theft.\n\n2.  The doll-house disappeared during the single hour after Fiona got up.  \n    There are therefore only four possible thieves: Kyle, Julia, Lucius or Reg.\n\n3.  Moving a ten-million-dollar, jewel-encrusted, eight-room doll-house is not something you can tuck into a pocket or a purse.  \n    Whoever took it had to carry some sort of container large enough to hide it.\n\n4.  What was each person carrying when he or she arrived?  \n       • Kyle – nothing.  \n       • Julia – a small purse and a clipboard.  (Much too small.)  \n       • Lucius – he pedalled up on an exotic bicycle; no bag is ever mentioned.  \n       • Reg – forty bouquets of flowers in his delivery van, plus the buckets and packing boxes that go with them.  \n         A bouquet bucket is big enough to hide a doll-house.\n\n5.  Physical clue inside the house: in the little den where the doll-house had stood, the detective finds “a fresh bouquet of unhappy, sun-less flowers resting on the floor.”  \n    Why is there a bouquet in that one spot and nowhere else yet?  And why do the flowers already look droopy?  \n    Because they spent the night shut up in the dark van – they were never meant for display; they were only brought in to fill the empty space left by the stolen doll-house.\n\n6.  Only Reg had both the means (large containers and a van to hide the loot) and an unquestioned reason for walking about the house carrying bulky objects.  \n    Once the house was decorated he could simply drive out with the rest of the bouquets and, buried among them, the priceless Russian doll-house.\n\n7.  The detective’s search of Julia’s car was just a demonstration to the group; after finding nothing he already knew who really had a suitable hiding place – the florist with the still-loaded van parked outside.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nKyle, Julia, Lucius Oswald, Reg\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nReg (the florist)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nVery early in the morning Reg drove up the half-mile driveway in his van loaded with forty floral arrangements.  \nWhile placing bouquets around the mansion he entered the small den and saw the fabulous black-wood Russian doll-house glittering with jewels.  \nKnowing he could easily conceal it among his flowers and drive away later unnoticed, he acted at once.  \nHe carried in one extra bouquet, set it on the floor where the doll-house had stood, lifted the doll-house, wrapped it in florist’s tissue, slipped it into one of the deep plastic flower buckets in his van and covered it with more flowers.  \nBecause the bouquet he used as a decoy had spent hours shut in the dark van, its blooms already looked “sun-less” and droopy when the detective found them.  \nReg then continued his deliveries and waited for Julia’s party to begin, planning to leave with the van – and the doll-house – once his job was done.  \nBefore that could happen the theft was discovered and the detective called in; the guard’s statement that no vehicle had yet left the grounds confirmed the loot was still hidden in Reg’s van.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Kyle had not brought or handled anything large enough to hide a doll-house and had spent the entire morning in the house with Fiona; he had nowhere to conceal it.  \n• Julia possessed only a purse and thin clipboards—far too small—and her car was empty.  \n• Lucius arrived on a bicycle and could not carry away an object of that size; he never left the kitchen area.  \nOnly Reg had both the motive (a valuable antique easy to resell) and, crucially, the opportunity and the necessary container to spirit it away.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

We'll have to figure out who could've stolen your dollhouse. Can you tell me anything about them?\" \"Well first, there's my boyfriend Kyle.” I'd seen his picture in the paper. (There had been a small scandal when late one night he'd crashed his car.) Maybe the reputation he got was unfair, but just being here today also made him a suspect. Could he also be seducing the singer, in order to steal from her? Also in Fiona's house was Lucius Oswald, the chief caterer. He was well respected throughout Hollywood as a brilliant but strange servant to the stars. Lucius arrived that morning on an exotic bicycle from Sweden, and Fiona escorted him to examine the kitchen for his twenty-person catering crew, who were scheduled to arrive that afternoon. I immediately wondered if he had a side business selling the occasional stolen antique! Lucius was hired by suspect #3, a party planner named Julia. She'd become famous herself for being able to organize a party for 300 people overnight. Julia was smart, energetic, and very serious about her career, and when you hired Julia, she'd guarantee a wonderful party with the best caterer in town. But maybe she was secretly bitter after planning hundreds of parties for other people. Everyone there was a glamour-industry professional except one. His name was Reg, and he had dark eyes above thin lips that didn't smile. He acknowledged that part of him didn't even want to be here, saying he felt out of place in the houses of the rich and famous. But when Julia had seen his gorgeous bouquets, she'd insisted he be her party's florist. Reg had dutifully loaded 40 bouquets into his van to decorate all the rooms in Fiona's house. He didn't usually fill orders involving this many bouquets, and he'd obviously feel more comfortable back in his flower shop. But had he grabbed a souvenir? \"I want this solved quickly,” Fiona moaned. \"So do I,” snapped Julia, bringing Lucius and Reg into the room from the kitchen next door. Kyle heard their footsteps echoing across the marble floor, and came down the staircase from the second floor. He had long, glamorous hair, and wore an expensive looking shirt. Seizing the moment, I asked: who was the first person to arrive? The night before, after Fiona's television appearance, she'd had a date with Kyle. She picked him up in her famous red Ferrari and drove him back to her estate. Kyle said in a lazy voice, \"So I've been here since last night.” \"I wasn't,” Julia added. \"I had Reg start delivering the flowers early, and then sent Lucius over to begin preparing the kitchen.” Were you in the kitchen all morning? I asked Lucius. \"A caterer has to know what kind of facilities he has,” Lucius insisted defensively. I have to ask you all a very important question, I told the suspects. Was anyone here carrying anything when they arrived? \"Not me,” said Kyle. \"Just one of my clipboards,” said Julia. \"And your purse!” Kyle challenged. \"Search it!” Julia said sharply, holding her purse open for all of us to see. \"There's no Russian dollhouse in here!\" \"Julia,” I said, \"I'm afraid I'm going to have to search your car.” \"Go ahead!” she said furiously. \"I've got nothing to hide!\" We searched Julia's car, and sure enough, we found nothing inside except another clipboard. As the four suspects stared, I turned and announced: \"I'm ready to identify our thief.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Julia; (b) Kyle; (c) Lucius; (d) Reg",
      "answer": "(d) Reg",
      "outcome": "\"Fiona's guard told us that no one left,” I said. \"So whoever stole the dollhouse must've have hidden it here!\"\n\"That rules me out,” said Kyle. \"Fiona drove me here in her Ferrari, and she's driving me home later tonight! So unless I hid the dollhouse in my shirt, there'd be no one way I could sneak it out!\"\n\"That let's me out too,” said Julia, gratefully. \"So that's why you wanted to search my car!\"\n\"Correct,” I told Julia. \"I wanted to rule you out. And as for your eccentric caterer. . .” I said. \"No matter how greedy he might secretly be, he couldn't carry a stolen dollhouse while pedaling home on his Swedish bicycle.”\nLucius thought for a moment, then smiled, and nodded. \"That's true,” he said, obviously relieved that he was no longer a suspect.\n\"So of the four suspects, that leaves. . .”\nReg the florist glared back, defensively. \"Do you know how hard I've worked just to keep my flower shop in business? I've always thought I was as honest as anyone, but when I saw that expensive dollhouse sitting there. .”\n\"When we saw your bouquet, we know you'd been in the den. You said you weren't comfortable in a rich person's house. And it'd be easy to hide the dollhouse in a florist's truck, hidden away among your pots and bouquets.”\n\"Too easy,” said Reg, sadly.\nFiona's silent security guard phoned the police, and the beautiful dollhouse was discovered tucked behind a stack of fertilizer bags in the back of Reg's truck. Fiona was thrilled, and excitedly began planning the night's party again with Julia and Reg. She couldn't wait to tell the story of her adventure that night to all of her 300 friends.\nAs I walked to the door of her enormous room, she said one more thing.\n\"Thank you.”"
