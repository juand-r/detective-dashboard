In that night, down darkened streets \ntwo children go beg for treats. \"Halloween? We ignore dangers \nand take candy gifts from strangers!\" Mark and his friend Ann did good, \nvisiting their neighborhood. Candies soon would fill their sacks.\nThey should carry home their snacks. Skies were dark, with moonlit clouds,\nbut they'd left the begging crowds. for one last house, though they didn't know\nit's one spot where they shouldn't go. It's a dark house, there, alone\nWinds make its old windows groan. Grass had fled its dirty lawn.\nAll its trees and plants were gone. Silence took their place, and gloom. \nIt's deserted -- like a tomb. \"This is scary,\" Mark told Ann.\n\"Last time I came here, I ran. \"I heard noises, like a ghost.\"\n\"I'm not scared,\" Ann liked to boast. No one was around that night,\nand Mark's heart was filled with fright. Ann dared him to pay a visit.\n\"Hear those noises? Mark, what is it?\" They tiptoed up to the doorstep.\nMark didn't want to take one more step. Strange noises came from inside.\nbut wind made the door swing wide. Darkness loomed, but Ann could spy \na dirty flashlight waiting nearby. With its beam they saw dark hallways.\nWould Ann take the challenge? Always. She grabbed Mark and whispered slow.\n\"Let's see where these dark halls go.\" With each step the floor would creak\nIts old wood began to reek. Dust and strange smells, all around.\nMark tried not to make a sound. Ann's flashlight then beamed the room\nsearching for those sounds of gloom. In her flashlight, she would trust.\nAll it lit were piles of dust. Giant dust balls, inches wide,\nfilled the house's dark inside. It had gathered over chairs,\nin the corners, on the stairs. Ann was curious, not afraid.\nHow was it those sounds were made? In the dark she paused to stare\nat one footprint on the stair. Grey balls bounced against their shoes.\n\"Let's go up and look for clues.\" \"Or we could go home,\" Mark said.\n\"That noise could be someone dead! Are we safe here?\" Ann said no.\n\"Even so, I've got to know.\" Mark would run, but in that night\nAnn still held the only light. From the downstairs dust that reeks\nto the old staircase that creaks,  Ann would move, then stop to stare\nat the pattern on the stair. On each step, a shape she knew: \nDarker outlines of a shoe In the dust, the stairway mounting,\nUp the steps, Mark started counting. It's a trick he used when scared.\nCounting made him feel prepared. \"One, two, three, four -- I see twelve tracks\nOn the staircase.\" Ann said \"Relax.\" Soon her light had scanned the path.\nShe didn't need to fuss with math. Up the stairs she'd quickly run,\ntelling Mark this would be fun. Leaving him to mull her dares,\nAnn had vanished up the stairs And without the flashlight's spark\nMark stood in the silent dark. Questions seemed to cluster 'round.\nWhat had made that creepy sound? Mark said \"Well, this house is old.\" \nBut besides that -- it was cold. Dust brushed up against his feet.\nMaybe he should eat a treat. Then, like horrors when you're dreaming,\nMark heard Ann's voice. It was screaming. Screaming from upstairs, not stopping.\nWith terror, Mark's sweat was dropping. Should he see if Ann was dead,\nOr just count her screams instead? Three, four, five, six, screams were shrieking\nin that house whose floors were reeking. Eight screams, nine screams, they kept coming.\nTen and more -- the noise was numbing. What was in that room she'd lightened?\nWhat could make Ann's voice so frightened? Panicking now to his core, \nMark couldn't find the entry door. Stumbling through dark surrounding\nThere was just one clue -- that sounding. Ann yelled her eleventh scream\nand just like an awful dream Listening to her screaming voice,\nMark knew he had just one choice, One way not to be alone:\nrun to where Ann's flashlight shone. Without thinking, up he ran\ntowards the fourteen screams of Ann. On that second floor that rotted,\nMark discovered what she'd spotted. What was at the stairway's top?\nWhat he saw would make Mark stop, Stare amazed, and wonder, too.\nGaze was all that he could do. In the silent evening black,\nTwo white eyes were staring back. Hovering with its eyebrows spread,\nthey could see, a floating head!!! Just one head, but in the dark,\nits eyes moved from Ann to Mark. Quite alive, its shining face\nstared at them with ghostly grace. Silently it stared, unfrightened.\nMore dust on the floor was brightened by the glowing face, and by it,\nMark noticed Ann became quiet. He looked at her, and fear grew.\nAnn had witnessed something new. In the dark, but coming near them\ntwo more eyes would come to peer them! Down the hallway, bringing dread\nfloated up a second head! It's a woman, face still ghostly\nwearing ancient makeup, mostly. Bizarre rouge on glowing skin,\nTiny lines on eyebrows thin. Scraggly hair was dangling down,\nfrom her forehead, dirty brown. With its white eyes, Ann felt sure, \nIt was looking back at her. Suddenly the silence broke.\nThat white floating head? It spoke. \"Who?\" it asked Ann. \"Who are you?\nCan you hear me? You are new!\" \"Yes,\" the other face replied.\n\"What has made you stray inside?\" In the dark and silent house,\nAnn was quiet as a mouse. \"Speak!\" the face said, angry now.\n\"What has brought us here -- and how?\" Mark knew in that haunted night,\nsilence would be impolite. So he told the ghosts, \"It's late.\nHalloween, 2008. In this house, we found your head\nfloating here. We think you're dead. Maybe there's one day between\nlife and death, on Halloween. When you feel that night begin,\nGhosts can roam the earth again.\" Ann now asked them for a clue.\n\"We're just children. Who are you?\" And the glowing man's face moaned.\nOf an ancient pain he groaned. \"I was once a famous chief\nof an Indian tribe. A thief stole into our camp one night\nand he killed me in a fight.\" Soon his eyelids closed with fears.\nWhite and bloodshot eyes shed tears Then the female head moaned low,\n\"That's a century ago! I was wealthy, filled with kicks\nback in 1846. Till a sickness in the night\nturned my head into this fright.\" When they pondered how they'd died,\nboth the floating heads soon cried.  Through his sobs, the Indian chief\nshared the reason for his grief. \"We shared meadows without guilt\nbefore houses here were built.\" And the wealthy woman thought\nof the joys her life had brought. \"I strolled gaily down the street.\nYou know what I miss? My feet!\" Both heads then looked towards the ground,\nBut no feet there could be found. \"I once wore the poshest clothes,\nled to dances by my beaus. We became such dainty trippers, \nnight and day wore high-heeled slippers.” But now she sighed.\n\"Guess it's true -- I finally died.\" Then the chief remembered fun\nwhen he'd used his legs to run. \"All my life, the sweetest treat?\nFeeling grass on my feet. Always barefoot, always running,\nTracking game with all my cunning.\" Then the chief was startled loudly \nby a voice that rang out proudly. Mark and Ann stared for the flicker,\nTwo more ghost heads soon would bicker. \"This is wrong,\" the new head cried.\n\"Tell us when it was we died. \"1890? '92?\n\"I'm a ghost. Should I say 'boo?'\" They arrived, two more undead,\ndressed like they were newly wed. For the female head was pale.\non her face she wore a veil. On the man's head, hair was shiny \nslicked in place. His eyes were tiny. His bride also missed a treat\nwhere she'd dressed in fabrics sweet. As a child, and as wife --\nballet slippers, all her life. Now she stared, sad and defeated.\n\"This is wrong,\" her ghost repeated. With an angry voice her groom\nfollowed from a darkened room. \"We don't know you,\" he announced.\nTowards the other heads he bounced, As the hallway all around\nfilled with angry clomping sounds. Now the four heads -- two still sobbing\nIn the hallway floated, bobbing. Mark and Ann stared helplessly\ntil the bride shared her sad plea. \"There's one issue -- we agree here.\nWhat has summoned us to be here?\" All the other heads soon nodded.\nFrom their rests they'd now been prodded. And the wealthy woman railed\nat the way her fate had failed. \"Let us rest in peace,\" she'd say.\n\"Even on this holiday.\" \"We belong in our own world,\" \nshe complained. Her eyebrow curled. \"It must be some earthly pest\ndisturbing our well-earned rest!\" \"Find the crook,\" the Indian moaned.\n\"Who defiles us?\" Ann now groaned. All the heads that had just spoken\nNow glared straight at her, awoken from their peaceful ghostly slumbers.\nMark, in fright, returned to numbers. After all this elocution,\nWould the ghosts seek retribution? Was it dark revenge that waited?\nOr could ghosts still be placated? Suddenly, a hope Mark knew.\nHe remembered one small clue. \"Yes, you were aroused tonight.\nBut it wasn't Ann's small light. Someone's played a trick on you,\ndoused their face with ghostly goo Glowing white, but not a spirit.\nThey just wanted to get near it, So to watch when you awoke,\nspying on you ghostly folk. Not us children,\" Mark would boast. \n\"Someone here is not a ghost!\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Who can possibly be the culprit?  \n    –  The only people that are undeniably alive are Mark and Ann.  \n    –  Mark is terrified from the outset; he never leaves the front hall until he chases Ann’s screams, and he never has a light source.  Nothing points to him.  \n    –  Ann has the only torch, but she runs upstairs only after the first strange noises are heard.  The footprints already existed before she set foot on the staircase, so she cannot have made them.  \n    –  Four “floating heads” are encountered.  All four claim to be ghosts:  \n        a) the Indian chief  \n        b) the wealthy woman of 1846  \n        c) a veiled bride  \n        d) a slick-haired groom  \n\n2.  Physical evidence in the house  \n    a)  Thick, undisturbed dust everywhere – yet twelve fresh shoe-prints run   UP the staircase before the children ever climb it.  \n    b)  A loud series of “angry clomping sounds” accompanies the arrival of the newly-wed pair.  True ghosts with no feet would not clomp.  \n    c)  The bride and groom appear only after the children and the first two   heads have been talking for a while – exactly the delay one would expect for an intruder who has to get into costume and pick a moment to enter the scene.  \n\n3.  Inconsistent testimony  \n    a)  The chief and the wealthy woman remember precisely when and how they died.  \n    b)  The new head that speaks first (“This is wrong … Tell us when it was we died – 1890? ’92? … I’m a ghost, should I say ‘boo’?”) does NOT know the date of his (or her) own death and actually asks for coaching on how to act like a ghost – behaviour impossible for a genuine spirit but perfectly natural for a living impostor who has just blundered into real ghosts.  \n\n4.  Motive  \n    The impostor clearly wanted to watch real spirits “awake” on Halloween.  The phosphorescent paint (“ghostly goo”) on the face produced the glowing-head effect; black clothes hide the body so that only a floating head is seen in the dark.  \n\n5.  Process of elimination  \n    –  Mark and Ann had no time to create the footprints, the clomping, or the glowing faces; they were outside with other trick-or-treaters until moments before.  \n    –  The first two heads appear before any clomping, speak like people who actually remember their pasts, and never produce a footstep.  \n    –  The bride and groom arrive together, create the only foot-noises, and one of them (the groom) blurts out the suspicious lines about not knowing the year and needing to say “boo.”  \n    Therefore exactly one of the heads – the slick-haired groom – is a living person in disguise.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMark, Ann, Indian Chief head, Wealthy Woman head, Veiled Bride head, Slick-haired Groom head\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nThe Slick-Haired Groom (alias “the Groom-Head”)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring the afternoon of Halloween a curious adult (identity unknown, disguised later as a 1890s groom) broke into the long-abandoned house hoping to make contact with – or at least spy upon – the spirits rumoured to haunt it on Halloween night.  \nHe went upstairs, leaving twelve clear shoe-prints in the thick dust, and painted his face with phosphorescent “ghostly goo.”  Wearing black clothes he could stand in the dark so that only his glowing face was visible, giving the illusion of a “floating head.”  \n\nWhen the children entered, two genuine ghosts (the Indian chief and the wealthy woman) were already stirring.  Hearing voices downstairs, the impostor waited, then tried to join the scene as a third ghost – the “groom.”  He improvised badly, asking for the year of his own death and whether he should say “boo,” and his heavy shoes gave him away with “angry clomping sounds.”  His bride’s “head” was no more than a prop he brought along to reinforce the newly-wed story.\n\nMark noticed the inconsistencies – the fresh footprints, the clomping, the uncertainty about the date of death – and realised that one of the “ghosts” had to be a living person in disguise.  The glowing paint, not any trick-or-treaters’ flashlight, had awakened the real spirits, and the impostor was the one who had “defiled” their rest.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Mark: never left the children’s entry hall until he raced upstairs; he had no light and could not have painted a face or produced clomping.  \n•  Ann: was with Mark until she vanished upstairs; the footprints already existed and the clomping begins after she is heard screaming, not before.  \n•  Indian Chief head: appears first, before any clomping, speaks coherently about a 19th-century murder, never makes foot-noises.  \n•  Wealthy Woman head: appears second under the same conditions; no footsteps, clear memory of 1846.  \n•  Veiled Bride head: appears simultaneously with the groom and says nothing suspicious except an understandable lament (“This is wrong”), but the specific incriminating lines and the audible footfalls are attributed to the groom.  \n\nThus the slick-haired Groom head is the sole living culprit; the others are true spirits or, in the case of the children, innocent intruders. </WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Quite alive, its shining face\nstared at them with ghostly grace. Silently it stared, unfrightened.\nMore dust on the floor was brightened by the glowing face, and by it,\nMark noticed Ann became quiet. He looked at her, and fear grew.\nAnn had witnessed something new. In the dark, but coming near them\ntwo more eyes would come to peer them! Down the hallway, bringing dread\nfloated up a second head! It's a woman, face still ghostly\nwearing ancient makeup, mostly. Bizarre rouge on glowing skin,\nTiny lines on eyebrows thin. Scraggly hair was dangling down,\nfrom her forehead, dirty brown. With its white eyes, Ann felt sure, \nIt was looking back at her. Suddenly the silence broke.\nThat white floating head? It spoke. \"Who?\" it asked Ann. \"Who are you?\nCan you hear me? You are new!\" \"Yes,\" the other face replied.\n\"What has made you stray inside?\" In the dark and silent house,\nAnn was quiet as a mouse. \"Speak!\" the face said, angry now.\n\"What has brought us here -- and how?\" Mark knew in that haunted night,\nsilence would be impolite. So he told the ghosts, \"It's late.\nHalloween, 2008. In this house, we found your head\nfloating here. We think you're dead. Maybe there's one day between\nlife and death, on Halloween. When you feel that night begin,\nGhosts can roam the earth again.\" Ann now asked them for a clue.\n\"We're just children. Who are you?\" And the glowing man's face moaned.\nOf an ancient pain he groaned. \"I was once a famous chief\nof an Indian tribe. A thief stole into our camp one night\nand he killed me in a fight.\" Soon his eyelids closed with fears.\nWhite and bloodshot eyes shed tears Then the female head moaned low,\n\"That's a century ago! I was wealthy, filled with kicks\nback in 1846. Till a sickness in the night\nturned my head into this fright.\" When they pondered how they'd died,\nboth the floating heads soon cried.  Through his sobs, the Indian chief\nshared the reason for his grief. \"We shared meadows without guilt\nbefore houses here were built.\" And the wealthy woman thought\nof the joys her life had brought. \"I strolled gaily down the street.\nYou know what I miss? My feet!\" Both heads then looked towards the ground,\nBut no feet there could be found. \"I once wore the poshest clothes,\nled to dances by my beaus. We became such dainty trippers, \nnight and day wore high-heeled slippers.” But now she sighed.\n\"Guess it's true -- I finally died.\" Then the chief remembered fun\nwhen he'd used his legs to run. \"All my life, the sweetest treat?\nFeeling grass on my feet. Always barefoot, always running,\nTracking game with all my cunning.\" Then the chief was startled loudly \nby a voice that rang out proudly. Mark and Ann stared for the flicker,\nTwo more ghost heads soon would bicker. \"This is wrong,\" the new head cried.\n\"Tell us when it was we died. \"1890? '92?\n\"I'm a ghost. Should I say 'boo?'\" They arrived, two more undead,\ndressed like they were newly wed. For the female head was pale.\non her face she wore a veil. On the man's head, hair was shiny \nslicked in place. His eyes were tiny. His bride also missed a treat\nwhere she'd dressed in fabrics sweet. As a child, and as wife --\nballet slippers, all her life. Now she stared, sad and defeated.\n\"This is wrong,\" her ghost repeated. With an angry voice her groom\nfollowed from a darkened room. \"We don't know you,\" he announced.\nTowards the other heads he bounced, As the hallway all around\nfilled with angry clomping sounds. Now the four heads -- two still sobbing\nIn the hallway floated, bobbing. Mark and Ann stared helplessly\ntil the bride shared her sad plea. \"There's one issue -- we agree here.\nWhat has summoned us to be here?\" All the other heads soon nodded.\nFrom their rests they'd now been prodded. And the wealthy woman railed\nat the way her fate had failed. \"Let us rest in peace,\" she'd say.\n\"Even on this holiday.\" \"We belong in our own world,\" \nshe complained. Her eyebrow curled. \"It must be some earthly pest\ndisturbing our well-earned rest!\" \"Find the crook,\" the Indian moaned.\n\"Who defiles us?\" Ann now groaned. All the heads that had just spoken\nNow glared straight at her, awoken from their peaceful ghostly slumbers.\nMark, in fright, returned to numbers. After all this elocution,\nWould the ghosts seek retribution? Was it dark revenge that waited?\nOr could ghosts still be placated? Suddenly, a hope Mark knew.\nHe remembered one small clue. \"Yes, you were aroused tonight.\nBut it wasn't Ann's small light. Someone's played a trick on you,\ndoused their face with ghostly goo Glowing white, but not a spirit.\nThey just wanted to get near it, So to watch when you awoke,\nspying on you ghostly folk. Not us children,\" Mark would boast. \n\"Someone here is not a ghost!\"",

      "mystery_text": "In this mystery, tension climbs. \nAll the clues are hid in rhymes! It's a holiday delight, \ntelling of a spooky night. In that night, down darkened streets \ntwo children go beg for treats. \"Halloween? We ignore dangers \nand take candy gifts from strangers!\" Mark and his friend Ann did good, \nvisiting their neighborhood. Candies soon would fill their sacks.\nThey should carry home their snacks. Skies were dark, with moonlit clouds,\nbut they'd left the begging crowds. for one last house, though they didn't know\nit's one spot where they shouldn't go. It's a dark house, there, alone\nWinds make its old windows groan. Grass had fled its dirty lawn.\nAll its trees and plants were gone. Silence took their place, and gloom. \nIt's deserted -- like a tomb. \"This is scary,\" Mark told Ann.\n\"Last time I came here, I ran. \"I heard noises, like a ghost.\"\n\"I'm not scared,\" Ann liked to boast. No one was around that night,\nand Mark's heart was filled with fright. Ann dared him to pay a visit.\n\"Hear those noises? Mark, what is it?\" They tiptoed up to the doorstep.\nMark didn't want to take one more step. Strange noises came from inside.\nbut wind made the door swing wide. Darkness loomed, but Ann could spy \na dirty flashlight waiting nearby. With its beam they saw dark hallways.\nWould Ann take the challenge? Always. She grabbed Mark and whispered slow.\n\"Let's see where these dark halls go.\" With each step the floor would creak\nIts old wood began to reek. Dust and strange smells, all around.\nMark tried not to make a sound. Ann's flashlight then beamed the room\nsearching for those sounds of gloom. In her flashlight, she would trust.\nAll it lit were piles of dust. Giant dust balls, inches wide,\nfilled the house's dark inside. It had gathered over chairs,\nin the corners, on the stairs. Ann was curious, not afraid.\nHow was it those sounds were made? In the dark she paused to stare\nat one footprint on the stair. Grey balls bounced against their shoes.\n\"Let's go up and look for clues.\" \"Or we could go home,\" Mark said.\n\"That noise could be someone dead! Are we safe here?\" Ann said no.\n\"Even so, I've got to know.\" Mark would run, but in that night\nAnn still held the only light. From the downstairs dust that reeks\nto the old staircase that creaks,  Ann would move, then stop to stare\nat the pattern on the stair. On each step, a shape she knew: \nDarker outlines of a shoe In the dust, the stairway mounting,\nUp the steps, Mark started counting. It's a trick he used when scared.\nCounting made him feel prepared. \"One, two, three, four -- I see twelve tracks\nOn the staircase.\" Ann said \"Relax.\" Soon her light had scanned the path.\nShe didn't need to fuss with math. Up the stairs she'd quickly run,\ntelling Mark this would be fun. Leaving him to mull her dares,\nAnn had vanished up the stairs And without the flashlight's spark\nMark stood in the silent dark. Questions seemed to cluster 'round.\nWhat had made that creepy sound? Mark said \"Well, this house is old.\" \nBut besides that -- it was cold. Dust brushed up against his feet.\nMaybe he should eat a treat. Then, like horrors when you're dreaming,\nMark heard Ann's voice. It was screaming. Screaming from upstairs, not stopping.\nWith terror, Mark's sweat was dropping. Should he see if Ann was dead,\nOr just count her screams instead? Three, four, five, six, screams were shrieking\nin that house whose floors were reeking. Eight screams, nine screams, they kept coming.\nTen and more -- the noise was numbing. What was in that room she'd lightened?\nWhat could make Ann's voice so frightened? Panicking now to his core, \nMark couldn't find the entry door. Stumbling through dark surrounding\nThere was just one clue -- that sounding. Ann yelled her eleventh scream\nand just like an awful dream Listening to her screaming voice,\nMark knew he had just one choice, One way not to be alone:\nrun to where Ann's flashlight shone. Without thinking, up he ran\ntowards the fourteen screams of Ann. On that second floor that rotted,\nMark discovered what she'd spotted. What was at the stairway's top?\nWhat he saw would make Mark stop, Stare amazed, and wonder, too.\nGaze was all that he could do. In the silent evening black,\nTwo white eyes were staring back. Hovering with its eyebrows spread,\nthey could see, a floating head!!! Just one head, but in the dark,\nits eyes moved from Ann to Mark.
