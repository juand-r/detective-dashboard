    "full_text": "The engine roared on her pink Corvette, and Josie laughed insanely as its tires squealed up the highway ramp. “Catch us if you can!” she laughed. Josie Morales was wild. She also knew that her mother needed money. “We’re not late yet,” Josie shouted to me, as she sped instantly to sixty-five miles per hour and whizzed past the traffic. “Millionaire’s mansion, here we come!” Valentine’s Day was the busiest day of the year for Josie and her mother. They were both beautiful and smart, but after Josie’s father had died last year, Mrs. Morales couldn’t shake off the sadness. I worried about both of them, but finally in a dream, Mrs. Morales thought she saw her answer. She’d seen “the Valentine Mobile,” an exciting classic car airbrushed with red hearts and detailed with fancy lace patterns. Mrs. Morales decided to start a business helping other people treasure the ones they loved ... by delivering their valentines in a pink Corvette! “I’m desperate for Mother’s dream to come true,” Josie shouted over the roar of the engine. For the last year they’d been struggling without much success. Mrs. Morales worked hard in the shop, assembling beautiful bouquets for her customers. Then yesterday she’d received a phone call from a wealthy woman offering their first chance to earn some big money. “We’re going to deliver a million dollar piece of jewelry!” Josie told me, and the news made our rush down the highway even more exciting. Josie’s mother was especially busy at her shop today, assembling twenty-five valentine’s bouquets that her other customers had requested. The assembly would keep her occupied for hours, and so Josie got to drive the Corvette. As sunlight streamed through the window, Josie’s long black hair tossed madly in the wind. We had less than ten minutes to reach the mansion of the mysterious Lorraine Wellington, where we’d pick up the million dollar gift, and then surprise her husband that afternoon by delivering it in the pink Corvette. Josie shouted back at a honking driver. Yes, I was worried about Josie and her mother, and I knew time was short, but I was also worried about dying in a car crash! Josie left the highway and drove the fancy pink Corvette up a winding road across a beautiful hill, until we arrived at the gate of a very large estate. Its driveway was nearly a mile long. I’d imagined there would be birds in the woods surrounding the mansion—but everything was strangely quiet. The millionaire was reported to be eccentric and reclusive. The gates to the mansion were locked every night at sunset, and not opened again until sunrise the next day. When we got to the mansion, we were met with a surprise: Three police cars were parked in front, their bright lights rotating, valentine-red. On the steps, Lorraine Wellington stood nervously, surrounded by five police officers. Everyone knew that she’d inherited over fifty million dollars when she was just seventeen, and then quadrupled that money through smart business investments. “I’m proud of my success,” she was saying. She lived in the mansion with her husband Lester, who wasn’t nearly as good at business. “My husband spends most of his time playing golf and gambling,” Lorraine told the police. “But he also watches over our estate.” It was obvious that Lorraine Wellington adored Lester. The night before, she’d invited Josie and her mother to her guest cottage behind the mansion just before sunset, where she showed them the special gift she’d created for Valentine’s Day. Lorraine hired a famous designer to craft an elaborate wristwatch with a sparkling band lined with fourteen rows of diamonds and shiny strips of real silver. So Lester wouldn’t find it, she’d tucked it inside a vase on the bookshelf. “I checked it early this morning—and the watch was gone!” Because it was so expensive, Lorraine Wellington had called the police to launch an investigation. She looked tired and worried, and sported a bandage on her right hand. The “Valentine Mobile” wouldn’t be making its big delivery after all. And that meant no extra money for Josie and her mother. “Did anyone else know where the watch was hidden?” one of the police officers asked her. “I did,” Josie volunteered. “My mother and I were here last night, and Lorraine showed us her special hiding place.” “But the cottage was locked!” Lorraine wailed. “Only my husband and I had a key. Besides the copy I gave to Josie’s mother, of course.” The police looked at us suspiciously. “May we see the scene of the crime?” I asked quickly. Lorraine led us to the tiny cottage, which had floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides and a bookshelf on its fourth. Her worried hand trembled as she pulled out her key, saying her arthritis made it hard to clutch the key ring. Besides books, each shelf held an unusual decoration—including a plant, a globe, and even a stuffed rabbit. But one shelf was bare, the shelf where the vase had been. On the floor below the empty space lay the jagged pieces of the vase. It had been smashed to bits. Just then Lester Wellington appeared at the cottage, carrying an expensive pair of golf clubs. “Is this what you got me for Valentine’s Day?” he joked. “A police escort?” “Your present’s been stolen,” Lorraine said sadly, eying Josie suspiciously. “Do you think my mother stole it?” Josie asked defensively. “Well, I’m a practical business woman,” Lorraine said sternly. “I worry about anyone who’s crazy enough to start a business based on her dreams.” “It was a beautiful dream!” Josie retorted. “And she’s making it come true!” “Maybe she’s trying a little too hard,” the police officer suggested. “She could’ve used the key to come back and steal the wristwatch.” “I’m getting a wristwatch?” Lester asked with delighted surprise. “Not now, Lester,” Mrs. Wellington said with exasperation. “Wait a minute,” she added. “My maid Cindy also has a key to this cottage, I just remembered.” “Maybe she knocked over the vase while cleaning,” suggested Josie, “and found the wristwatch inside!” The police officer who had been questioning us hurried with Mrs. Wellington up the grand staircase to the bedroom where Cindy was dusting. “You have a key to the guest cottage?” he asked, and Cindy nodded yes. She was young and very careful about her dusting. Cindy said she started her cleaning every day while Mr. and Mrs. Wellington were asleep, so she needed keys to get into all the rooms. She began at eight and cleaned for eight hours. “When I went home yesterday, there was nothing out of order in the guest cottage.” I turned to Mrs. Wellington and asked, “Are you offering a reward for the return of your watch?” “Yes, of course!” she said quickly. “In that case,” I said, “you can give the reward money to Josie and her mother. Because I’ve figured out who stole your wristwatch.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Establish the time of the theft  \n   •  Lorraine says she “checked it early this morning – and the watch was gone.”  \n   •  The estate gates are locked every evening at sunset and are not reopened until sunrise.  \n   •  Therefore the watch disappeared sometime AFTER sunset and BEFORE sunrise – a period when nobody from outside the grounds could enter.\n\n2.  Who could have entered the locked cottage during that time?  \n   Key-holders:  \n      – Lorraine Wellington (lives in the mansion)  \n      – Lester Wellington (lives in the mansion)  \n      – Cindy the maid (lives outside, arrives after 8 a.m.)  \n      – Mrs. Morales (lives outside, was working in her flower shop)  \n\n   Only Lorraine and Lester were physically on the estate while the gates were shut, so only they had the necessary opportunity.\n\n3.  Who actually knew where the watch was hidden?  \n      – Lorraine (she hid it)  \n      – Josie and Mrs. Morales (were shown last night)  \n   Lester did not know; Cindy did not know.\n\n   If Lester wanted to steal it he would have had to search the whole cottage in the dark and just happen to smash the very vase that held the watch – wildly improbable.\n\n4.  Physical evidence that points at Lorraine  \n   •  The vase is smashed on the floor, yet Lorraine merely said the watch “was gone,” never mentioning a shattered vase. A person who genuinely discovered the theft would certainly mention the obvious damage.  \n   •  Lorraine is wearing a fresh bandage on her right hand and claims it is “arthritis,” but broken pottery is an excellent way to cut a hand.  \n   •  She first told police that only she, her husband and Mrs. Morales had keys, then “just remembered” that the maid also had one – a classic attempt to widen the circle of suspects and divert attention.\n\n5.  Motive  \n   •  Insurance scam or simple embarrassment.  Lorraine may have broken the vase and cut herself while retrieving the gift early this morning.  To avoid admitting her clumsiness (and perhaps to collect insurance money) she invented a theft and tried to pin it on the visiting florist who obviously needed money.\n\n6.  Conclusion  \n   Only Lorraine had motive, opportunity, knowledge of the hiding place, a fresh injury that matches the broken vase, and she gave contradictory, evasive statements.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLorraine Wellington, Lester Wellington, Cindy (the maid), Mrs. Morales, Josie Morales\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLorraine Wellington\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nVery early on Valentine’s morning, before the estate gates reopened, Lorraine went to the glass-walled guest cottage to fetch the wristwatch so she could wrap it for Lester.  \nWhen she lifted the vase she fumbled, dropped it, and the vase smashed on the floor.  A shard cut her right hand (hence the fresh bandage).  Embarrassed and annoyed at her own clumsiness, she decided to claim the watch had been stolen.  Calling the police would both divert suspicion from her and, if she played it right, allow her to collect the insurance on a “million-dollar” jewel.  She phoned the police, hinted at the poverty of the visiting florists, and at first concealed the maid’s key to push the suspicion outward.  Unfortunately for her, the combination of the closed gates, her unexplained injury, her failure to mention the shattered vase, and her inconsistent story revealed the truth.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Lester Wellington – Had the opportunity but no knowledge of the hiding place; would have had to search blindly in the locked cottage and somehow pick the exact vase.  No injuries or suspicious behavior.  \n\n•  Cindy the maid – Although she possesses a key, she cannot reach the estate before the gates open at sunrise, and Lorraine had already discovered the “theft” by then.  She also had no knowledge of the hiding place.  \n\n•  Mrs. Morales – She lives outside the estate; the gates were locked when the watch disappeared.  She spent the morning assembling 25 bouquets and never left the shop.  \n\n•  Josie Morales – No key and was racing toward the mansion only after the police had already arrived.  She was not on the grounds when the watch vanished.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

Besides books, each shelf held an unusual decoration—including a plant, a globe, and even a stuffed rabbit. But one shelf was bare, the shelf where the vase had been. On the floor below the empty space lay the jagged pieces of the vase. It had been smashed to bits. Just then Lester Wellington appeared at the cottage, carrying an expensive pair of golf clubs. “Is this what you got me for Valentine’s Day?” he joked. “A police escort?” “Your present’s been stolen,” Lorraine said sadly, eying Josie suspiciously. “Do you think my mother stole it?” Josie asked defensively. “Well, I’m a practical business woman,” Lorraine said sternly. “I worry about anyone who’s crazy enough to start a business based on her dreams.” “It was a beautiful dream!” Josie retorted. “And she’s making it come true!” “Maybe she’s trying a little too hard,” the police officer suggested. “She could’ve used the key to come back and steal the wristwatch.” “I’m getting a wristwatch?” Lester asked with delighted surprise. “Not now, Lester,” Mrs. Wellington said with exasperation. “Wait a minute,” she added. “My maid Cindy also has a key to this cottage, I just remembered.” “Maybe she knocked over the vase while cleaning,” suggested Josie, “and found the wristwatch inside!” The police officer who had been questioning us hurried with Mrs. Wellington up the grand staircase to the bedroom where Cindy was dusting. “You have a key to the guest cottage?” he asked, and Cindy nodded yes. She was young and very careful about her dusting. Cindy said she started her cleaning every day while Mr. and Mrs. Wellington were asleep, so she needed keys to get into all the rooms. She began at eight and cleaned for eight hours. “When I went home yesterday, there was nothing out of order in the guest cottage.” I turned to Mrs. Wellington and asked, “Are you offering a reward for the return of your watch?” “Yes, of course!” she said quickly. “In that case,” I said, “you can give the reward money to Josie and her mother. Because I’ve figured out who stole your wristwatch.”",

      "answer": "(d) Lorraine",
      "outcome": "“Mr. Wellington has a key,” Josie suggested. “Maybe he snuck in and stole the watch to cover some gambling debts.”\n“But he didn’t even know about the watch,” I pointed out. “The gift was going to be a surprise, and just now it was obvious he still didn’t know about it.”\n“Do you think Cindy stole it?” the police officer asked.\n“The watch was stolen in the evening,” I said. “If Cindy arrived at eight a.m. and then worked for eight hours, she’d have gone home before the watch was even stolen.”\n“I still think Josie’s mother stole the watch,” Lorraine Wellington said. “She needs the money, and she even had a key to the cottage!”\n“Your gate is open now, but it would’ve been locked last night. And the key was to the guest cottage, not the gate!” Josie retorted angrily.\n“And why would a thief risk getting caught by the noise of cracking the vase?” I asked.\nThe room was quiet for a moment.\n“Maybe it was hard to hold the vase, with your arthritis,” I suggested to Mrs. Wellington. “And even harder to pick the watch out from among its jagged pieces. Maybe that’s why you’re wearing a bandage.”\nMrs. Wellington didn’t say anything.\n“I wondered why a wealthy woman would hire a pink Corvette just to deliver her jewelry,” I continued.\n“She wanted someone she could frame for its disappearance!” Josie shouted.\n“Our jewelry’s insured,” Lester pointed out. “So filing an insurance claim could double the money.”\n“Shut up, Lester,” Mrs. Wellington snapped.\n“This is the first time I’ve seen one of your investments go wrong!” Lester laughed. The policeman laughed too, and Josie and I joined in. Even Mrs. Wellington had to smile.\n“If you’d filed a claim, you would’ve been a criminal,” the police officer said seriously. “You’re lucky these detectives stopped your scheme before it went too far.”\n“Happy Valentine’s Day!” Josie said with a laugh."
