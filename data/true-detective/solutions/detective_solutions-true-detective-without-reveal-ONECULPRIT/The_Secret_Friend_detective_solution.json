    "full_text": "Fred Foy’s wife passed away last year, leaving Fred a widower at age 65. Fred was grateful that his closest friends continued to include him in their social gatherings. So, it was at breakfast one morning at a local pancake house that Fred shared something with the Bakers and Cokers he had never shared with anyone. Retrieving an object from his pocket, he began to speak, “You four are our closest friends (Fred always spoke as if Bumps, his pet name for his wife, was still with them). It’s time to clear out some old business. I should’ve done this last year when Bumps passed away. I wish to show you this.” He opened his large hand and showed them what he had fished out of his pocket. It was a large, old-fashioned skeleton key. The five of them studied it in silence for several awkward moments. The key was impressive. Almost six inches long and plated with dullish gold, it was surprisingly light in weight. It was scratched in several places and was obviously very old. However, one of the friends knew its significance and what Fred was about to say. As if reading the mind of the “guilty” person, Fred continued, “As you know, our daughter Sarah died of leukemia in December of 1980, just before Christmas. That hurt has never gone away. It’s worse than losing Bumps last year.” Losing 12-year-old Sarah had thrown Fred and his wife into long bouts with depression. But, he continued, “A couple of years before her death, Sarah and Bumps found a large, old-fashioned door knob at a flea market and Bumps bought it for Sarah. It took me almost a week to get it installed on her bedroom door.” The memory of this brought a faint smile to Fred’s lips, “Now, I know there are two keys to the lock and I only have one. One of you has the other.” “What makes you think so, and why is it important?” asked Bill. “Because one of you was Sarah’s secret friend. She gave you the key. During the last few weeks of her life, it gave her great comfort to have such a bond with an adult person.” Fred stopped for a moment to let his words sink in. “Besides, the holder of the other key did some unusual things. After she died, several times when Bumps and I were away, you entered her room and left messages. We always kept her door locked, because Sarah felt secure when she locked herself in her room. Among other things, we learned that a scholarship had been funded in her name, a memorial stone was placed in her honor at church and the expenses for her funeral had been made by, as the funeral home director told us, “an anonymous benefactor and holder of the key.” Fred paused to look at his friends and stated simply, “It is time that I look whoever has the key in the eye and thank you properly for all three of us.” Nobody said a word until Lyn asked, “How did the person with the key get into your house?” Long ago, the Bakers, Cokers and Foys all traded house keys. It made it easy for them to check on one another’s homes when any of the families happened to be away. Fred smiled, “Perhaps you have forgotten that all of us have keys to each of our three homes.” Midge asked, “So, who do you think has the key?” Fred answered, “I don’t know.” Looking at his friends, he added, “If you won’t own up to it, perhaps you will allow me to ask a few questions.” “Ask away,” said Bill, as Harold nervously wiped his glasses with a red pocket cloth. Fred responded, “First, let me explain some things. We noticed the key missing about a month before Sarah passed on. At first, we thought she had hidden it. But a week before her death she said, “I gave it to one of your friends. I have a secret friend now.” We didn’t think anything of this until the messages began to show up in her room – a room we always kept locked in her honor, unless we were in there to clean and dust. Now, one time we found a cigarette lighter on the floor. Another time a piece of tissue paper and still another time, a Robert’s Book Store business card. We also noticed the handwritten notes were written in an awkward script. That could be a clue or not, as the writer may have intentionally disguised his or her writing style.” Fred paused to catch his breath as the waitress poured fresh cups of coffee. Fred nodded and turned to Bill, “So, what do you have to say for yourself?” “You know I am a smoker, but I’ve always used matches. I’m not Sarah’s secret friend, but would have liked to have been.” Harold flashed a smile of appreciation to his old friend, but he knew that somebody was still hiding the truth. He said to Lyn, “Tell me why you cannot be Sarah’s friend?” “Well, for one thing – I didn’t know you had a key to my house … I also didn’t know that we had a key to your house.” Turning to her husband, he asked “Harold, have you ever been a smoker?” Fred could not recall ever seeing Harold smoke in all the years he had known him, but realized that really didn’t count for much. Harold answered, “Yes, but I quit early, before meeting you and Darlene. My allergies just will not tolerate it.” Finally, Fred looked again at Midge and asked, “It seems to me that I recall you were a smoker.” “I was,” she admitted, but that was a long time ago.” “How long ago?” “Can’t remember for sure, but Ronald Reagan was president.” Fred didn’t need to ask more questions. He knew who his daughter’s secret friend was.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What had to be true of the secret friend  \n   a. Had a copy of the Foys’ house key (all four guests did).  \n   b. Had Sarah’s bedroom key.  \n   c. Visited the room several times in November-December 1980 while the Foys were away.  \n   d. Left three tell-tale objects:  \n      • a cigarette lighter  \n      • a wadded tissue  \n      • a Robert’s Book Store business card  \n   e. Paid for a memorial stone, a scholarship and the funeral – so was both generous and anxious to remain anonymous.  \n   f. Deliberately wrote notes in an awkward, disguised hand.\n\n2. What we learn during the breakfast\n   • Bill Baker ‑ still smokes, but says he has “always used matches”.  \n   • Lyn Baker ‑ claims she did not even know the couples had exchanged house keys (if true, she could hardly have used one).  \n   • Harold Coker ‑ used to smoke, but says he quit long ago because of allergies; is very nervous during the questioning and keeps wiping his glasses with a cloth (the one person obviously suffering from the sort of nasal/eye allergies that make people carry tissues).  \n   • Midge Coker ‑ also admits she once smoked, but says the last time was “when Ronald Reagan was president” (1981-89) – i.e., after Sarah died, so she would **not** have been smoking in 1980.\n\n3. Matching the physical clues\n   • The tissue fits someone with allergies; Harold is the only one who mentions a severe allergy and is seen using a cloth on his runny eyes.  \n   • A business-card from a bookshop fits a bookish person; Harold is the only one portrayed wearing glasses and fussing with them (again suggesting a heavy reader).  \n   • The lighter at first seems to point to Bill, but Harold admits he **did** smoke once.  A former smoker may still have a lighter around the house for candles, fireplaces, etc.  Dropping it would not contradict his present “I quit long ago” statement but would give him a motive to deny still owning one.\n\n4. Motive and character\n   • The anonymous benefactor had to be thoughtful, organised and quietly generous.  Nothing in the story suggests Lyn or Midge have that independent access to money; Bill’s habitual smoking and bluff manner fit him less well with the meticulous, secret gestures described.  \n   • Harold is the one shown as sensitive (nervously cleaning his glasses, worrying about allergies) – exactly the sort who might have formed a gentle, private bond with a dying twelve-year-old and then kept it secret out of modesty.\n\n5. Logical pivot\n   Fred’s last question to Midge nails the time line: Sarah died in December 1980 (still the Carter administration).  Midge says she was smoking **later**, in Reagan’s years.  Therefore the lighter cannot have been hers.  \n   Bill’s “I always use matches” is easily tested and would be a foolish lie if he did carry a lighter; besides, a habitual smoker rarely mixes the two.  \n   Harold, however, has every connection to the other two objects and a plausible reason for having an old lighter in 1980 even though he now claims to have quit; his visible nervousness is the final giveaway that makes Fred stop questioning.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBill Baker, Lyn Baker, Harold Coker, Midge Coker\n</SUPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nHarold Coker\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nIn the autumn of 1980 twelve-year-old Sarah Foy, knowing that her illness was terminal, found comfort in talking with her neighbour and family friend Harold Coker.  She gave Harold the second key to the big, old-fashioned lock on her bedroom door so that he could slip in and leave her encouraging notes while her parents were out.\n\nHarold, a book lover, often bought little gifts for Sarah at Robert’s Book Store; one such purchase left a business card on her floor.  Harold still kept an old cigarette lighter from the days before his allergies forced him to quit smoking, and on one visit it dropped from his pocket.  He habitually carried tissues for his allergy-irritated eyes and nose; one of them also fell unnoticed.\n\nWhen Sarah died, Harold quietly paid the funeral-home bill, established a church memorial stone and endowed a small scholarship in her name – always insisting on anonymity.\n\nFor sixteen years he kept the secret.  At the breakfast table, however, the physical clues (tissue, book-store card, lighter) and his nervous behaviour made Fred realise that Harold had been his daughter’s secret friend and benefactor.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Bill Baker: Although he is a smoker, he openly admits it and states he always uses matches; no other clue links him to the room.  Nothing ties him to Robert’s Book Store or to a need for tissues.  \n• Lyn Baker: She professes ignorance of the house-key exchange, which if true would have prevented her from entering the Foys’ home.  None of the items left in Sarah’s room points to her.  \n• Midge Coker: She had quit smoking only after Reagan became president, so she would not have been carrying a lighter in 1980.  There is likewise no evidence she visited Robert’s Book Store or that she needed tissues.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Fred patted Sarah’s secret friend gently on the shoulder. In a shaky voice, he said, “In the back of my mind I suspected it was you, but wasn’t sure until now. Thank you so much from all of us. Do you still have the key?”\nSarah’s friend was very moved and answered, “Yes, do you want it back?” Before Fred could answer, she asked, “How did you figure it out? It’s been a secret all these years.”\nFred said, “No, keep the key. I am certain Sarah would wish for you to have it. As for your other question, well, I didn’t think too much about it until Bumps died, then it began to play in my mind. I’ve wondered how much time I have left to thank a very kind and generous friend. But, I digress. In speaking with all four of you at the same time, it wasn’t too hard to sort this out, although I was frustrated at first. As I asked questions, I eliminated those who claimed not to have the items left in Sarah’s room.” Fred paused a moment for dramatic effect.\nHe continued, “I eliminated Bill because he does not use a lighter. I have no way of knowing if he was ever a customer of Robert’s Book Store or used paper tissue, but he proved to us that he uses matches. In Lyn’s case, she told us she did not know about the spare house key in Bill’s possession.”\nFred paused again, emotion catching up with him. “I wasn’t sure of Harold. But, he told us he quit smoking before we met him and I believe it. I’ve never seen him with a cigar or cigarette.”\nMidge said, “So why me? I’ve answered everything truthfully.”\nFred grinned, “I know, but you made a mistake.”\n“It was your comment concerning smoking. You said you quit sometime while Ronald Reagan was president. President Reagan took office in January of 1981. President Carter was still in office when Sarah passed away in December, 1980.”\nMidge stared at Fred with an incredulous look on her face. Softly, she said, “I forgot about President Carter. Well, you’re probably all wondering about Robert’s Book Store. Robert Ellingwood is my brother. The store went out of business shortly after Sarah died. The tissue was mine, too. … Guess I would not be a very good burglar – or historian.”\nFred smiled and said to her, “Bumps, Sarah and I owe you a debt that can never be repaid. I have learned some very important things about you today.”\nMidge returned his grin and replied, “The first is obvious. What are the others?\n“That you are kind hearted and do our Lord’s good work in secret, but that you also have a very poor memory and a tendency to lose things.”\nLaughter from Fred’s table could be heard throughout the large pancake house.",

      "outcome": "Fred patted Sarah’s secret friend gently on the shoulder. In a shaky voice, he said, “In the back of my mind I suspected it was you, but wasn’t sure until now. Thank you so much from all of us. Do you still have the key?”\nSarah’s friend was very moved and answered, “Yes, do you want it back?” Before Fred could answer, she asked, “How did you figure it out? It’s been a secret all these years.”\nFred said, “No, keep the key. I am certain Sarah would wish for you to have it. As for your other question, well, I didn’t think too much about it until Bumps died, then it began to play in my mind. I’ve wondered how much time I have left to thank a very kind and generous friend. But, I digress. In speaking with all four of you at the same time, it wasn’t too hard to sort this out, although I was frustrated at first. As I asked questions, I eliminated those who claimed not to have the items left in Sarah’s room.” Fred paused a moment for dramatic effect.\nHe continued, “I eliminated Bill because he does not use a lighter. I have no way of knowing if he was ever a customer of Robert’s Book Store or used paper tissue, but he proved to us that he uses matches. In Lyn’s case, she told us she did not know about the spare house key in Bill’s possession.”\nFred paused again, emotion catching up with him. “I wasn’t sure of Harold. But, he told us he quit smoking before we met him and I believe it. I’ve never seen him with a cigar or cigarette.”\nMidge said, “So why me? I’ve answered everything truthfully.”\nFred grinned, “I know, but you made a mistake.”\n“It was your comment concerning smoking. You said you quit sometime while Ronald Reagan was president. President Reagan took office in January of 1981. President Carter was still in office when Sarah passed away in December, 1980.”\nMidge stared at Fred with an incredulous look on her face. Softly, she said, “I forgot about President Carter. Well, you’re probably all wondering about Robert’s Book Store. Robert Ellingwood is my brother. The store went out of business shortly after Sarah died. The tissue was mine, too. … Guess I would not be a very good burglar – or historian.”\nFred smiled and said to her, “Bumps, Sarah and I owe you a debt that can never be repaid. I have learned some very important things about you today.”\nMidge returned his grin and replied, “The first is obvious. What are the others?\n“That you are kind hearted and do our Lord’s good work in secret, but that you also have a very poor memory and a tendency to lose things.”\nLaughter from Fred’s table could be heard throughout the large pancake house."
