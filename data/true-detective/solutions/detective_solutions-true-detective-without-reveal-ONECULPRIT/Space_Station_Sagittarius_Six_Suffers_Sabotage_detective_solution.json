    "full_text": "Lt. Commander Cecelia Holman was jolted awake by the screech of the security siren. She leapt out of her bunk, donned her skinsuit, dashed down the corridor and was in the station security office in 15 minutes flat. “Report, Sergeant,” she ordered as she slipped into her command chair. “Ma'am! Engineering reports a security breach in the shield generator compartment. Shield status has gone from standby to inoperative. Fault diagnostics determined the shield structure control unit had failed. Lt. Erikson ordered the spare from stores before heading for the compartment. The Stores computer informs us the spare is no longer in inventory and Lt. Erikson has found that the SSCU hasn't failed, but has been removed, Ma'am. The security alarm was immediately activated and the station military section has been sealed.” Before Cecilia could respond, the security alarm changed to the deep tones of “Battle Stations” and her console lit with an incoming call from the station's military exec, Captain Phillips. Cecilia keyed acceptance and his craggy face appeared on the screen. “Commander, we have multiple, unscheduled hyperspace arrivals. The timing is highly suspicious. We need full shield capability. They’ll reach controlled missile range in six hours. I need you to do your Sherlock Holmes act, Holman. First priority: find one of the control units. Second: find and lock down our saboteur.\" He paused a moment, then, \"Do your best, Ceci, we're relying on you.” “Aye, aye, Skipper!” Cecelia responded. Cutting the connection, Cecilia looked at her team leaders and began issuing orders. *** Two hours later, they gathered in the security conference room to review progress. “Sergeant Benson, your team had personnel checks. Status, please?” “Ma'am, 18 personnel have the expertise to remove the SSCU without setting off security alerts. Fifteen of these have alibis for the time period in question. The remaining three are Lt. Erikson’s duty techs, Valance and Bennington, and Master Sgt. O'Hennessey. I also brought in Lt. Erikson since she missed the alert. They’re all in detention, Ma'am.” “What do we have on their backgrounds?” “Nothing indicative, Ma'am. Valance was commended for bravery when the Ravshek took Herstog. His wife and son didn't get off-planet. He hates the Ravers – not a surprise since they eat human flesh! CIT has verified the incoming ships as Ravshek, so it's unlikely he's our saboteur. “He and Bennington were working on a control shunt in corridor B32 that has been causing problems for the last four days. Both have insulation smears on hands and uniform sleeves that confirm this and Valance says Bennington was there the whole time. They’re only still suspects because both have the capability and are each others' alibi.” “The others?” “O'Hennessey is in for his fourth five-year stretch. Excellent duty ratings, but some black marks for off-duty public brawling and operating a still.” “Erikson and Bennington?” “The lieutenant was a corporal, Ma'am, sent to OTC on the recommendation of her battalion CO Major Hilton. She was 47th in her class of 100. There's nothing official, but the secured section of her personnel dossier includes a suspicion that her relationship with the Major may have breeched fraternization regulations. “Bennington's ratings indicate a so-so technical ability; it's questionable he could have removed the SSCU without setting off alarms. He has a reputation as a ladies' man.” “I see. Have Erikson, Valance and Bennington placed in an interview room together and O’Hennessey in a separate interview room.\" Cecilia turned to her next team leader. “Sergeant Devallier, civilian activity?” “We've interviewed all civilians that entered the military sector bar one, a Villiasoo trader called Scrivine. He had a meeting with the quartermaster at 0300 hours; wanted to sell some luxury foodstuffs for the officer's mess. Came in on the 'Cheeanie' seven hours ago and requested an immediate meeting on the basis of a tight shipping schedule. He had a security detail from reception to the quartermaster's and back. He left the military sector at 0324 hours. Cpl. Devon, who led the detail, says Scrivine had no unescorted access anywhere. He confirms that Valance and Bennington who were working in corridor B32 when they passed. Scrivine did chat with and give samples to some of the crew, including Valance.” “Hmmm ... the Villiasoo are supposedly neutral, but I've heard they're more 'neutral' towards the Ravshek than to us. Sgt. Billings, what have you managed to put together from the logs?” “Ma'am, the SSCU was disabled at 0346 hours. Lt. Erikson was on duty but somehow missed it at that time. She posted her inventory request for the spare at 0401, in response to the 0400 maintenance report. The 0300 to 0400 inventory log was deleted, the 0200 to 0300 log archived normally and the 0400 to 0500 log initiated normally; but whoever removed the spare SSCU must have wiped the log. Inventory status can't be manually altered; the SSCU spare was there at 0300 and gone at 0400. Total parts count was reduced by three during that period. We’ve accounted for two. The third had to be the SSCU.” “Probably. Anything else?” “The last garbicle ejection from military sector was 17 hours ago. I let Hermes know straight off, Ma'am.” “Good. Sgt. Hernandez, search status?” “Ma'am, teams are searching all compartments, but it's going to take time. With Sgt. Billings' confirmation that the garbage hasn’t been frozen and ejected I've had a team scan the compartment. No components intrinsic to SSCUs were detected.” “I want an eyeball search, please, Sergeant.” “Aye aye, Ma'am.” “And have a security tech check the repair work in B32. I want to know about anything even minutely unusual.” *** Cecelia was at her workstation, reviewing video feeds from the brig. O'Hennessey had a visitor, a security sergeant who shouldn’t be there. She keyed the feed for sound. “...ring squad for you this time, Oh Hen-sick-be!” sneered the sergeant. “In your dreams, Bannick. With Sherlock in charge of the investigation, she'll find the saboteur, which sure as heck ain't me!” In the other room, Lieutenant Erikson was pacing while Valance and Bennington sat at the table. Erikson's uniform was immaculate until she turned round to pace the other way. Two handprints, the color of insulation foam and of a size to match Bennington’s, on her lower back marred the otherwise perfection. Cecelia’s comm buzzed. It was Sgt. Hernandez. “Ma'am, the team in the garbage disposal just found a woman's finger. It's been sent for DNA analysis. And the tech checking the repairs in B32 found two lighting controllers hidden in the insulation; they're brand new, still sealed in plastic wrap.” “Thank you, Hermes, that’s exactly what I needed to know.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who had the necessary technical skill?\n   – Security says only four people could remove an SSCU without tripping alarms:  \n     Lt. Erikson, her two duty technicians Valance and Bennington, and M/Sgt O’Hennessey.\n\n2. Motive  \n   – Valance loathes the Ravshek; sabotaging the shield would help them – the exact opposite of his feelings.  \n   – Bennington is described only as a “ladies’-man”; no political motive is hinted at.  \n   – O’Hennessey is a long-service NCO who likes to brawl and run a still – but nothing connects him with the Ravshek.  \n   – Erikson’s record is the only one that hints at divided loyalties (the sealed note about an irregular relationship with Major Hilton – officers sometimes become security liabilities when they have secrets to hide).  So she is the only one for whom an intelligence service would have any leverage.\n\n3. The missing items in Stores  \n   – The inventory count dropped by THREE pieces during the deleted 0300-0400 log.  \n   – Two BRAND-NEW lighting controllers, still in their plastic wrap, are discovered hidden in the wall of corridor B32.  \n   – Therefore the third missing item from that hour has to be the SSCU spare.  \n   – Whoever removed the spare hid the two controllers to “soak up” the parts-count change.  That requires knowledge of how the automatic inventory system works – a supervisory level such as a lieutenant’s, not an ordinary tech’s.\n\n4. Links that put one suspect in the exact hiding place  \n   – Bennington’s insulation-smeared hand-prints are on the lower back of Lt. Erikson’s uniform.  \n   – The only place anyone was working with insulation that night is corridor B32 – the very place the hidden parts are found.  \n   – So Erikson, not just her technicians, was physically in B32 during the critical period.\n\n5. The mutilated finger  \n   – The garbage‐disposal scan showed no SSCU components but a later eyeball check finds a WOMAN’S finger.  \n   – Of the four technical suspects, only Lt. Erikson is female.  \n   – A saboteur who had just dumped a large metal unit down a disposal chute could easily have had a finger sheared off.\n\n6. Timeline (all station times)\n   03 00 – 03 24  Alien trader escorted in Stores: perfect cover traffic.  \n   03 00 – 04 00  Log later deleted; 3 items removed (1 SSCU, 2 controllers).  \n                     Lt. Erikson visits B32, flirts with Bennington (hand-prints) and hides the parts.  \n   03 46            On-line SSCU pulled; shield drops.  \n   04 00            Automatic maintenance report.  \n   04 01            Erikson “requests” the spare she already knows is missing – an attempt to look helpful and to direct attention away from herself.\n\nEverything points at one person who had motive, knowledge, opportunity, was present in the hiding place and has just lost a finger.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLt. Erikson, Technician Valance, Technician Bennington, Master-Sergeant O’Hennessey, Trader Scrivine\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLieutenant Erikson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFor four days Lt. Erikson cultivated a “legitimate” reason to have technicians opening the insulation in corridor B32.  \nDuring the trader’s visit (03 00–03 24) she slipped into Stores, used her access to draw the spare SSCU and two lighting controllers, deleted the hourly log, and carried the three boxed units to B32.  While chatting with her technicians Bennington, his foam-covered hands carelessly patted her lower back, leaving the two insulation hand-prints that will later incriminate her.  She hid all three boxes behind freshly-replaced insulation.\n\nAt 03 46 she entered the shield generator compartment alone, removed the working SSCU and bypassed the alarms.  She shoved the heavy unit into a garbage chute; in the process a chute door slammed and severed one of her fingers.  She bandaged the hand hastily, returned to her console and, when the automatic maintenance report appeared at 04 00, sent the routine requisition for the spare (04 01), pretending surprise that it was missing.  With both the on-line and the spare units gone, the station would be unable to raise its main shield in time for the approaching Ravshek task group.\n\nHer plan collapsed when the security teams (a) recovered the two “decoy” lighting controllers, (b) found the severed female finger, and (c) noticed the insulation prints tying her to the hiding place.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nValance – Hatred of the flesh-eating Ravshek gives him a clear motive NOT to help them; his presence in B32 is corroborated, no access to inventory logs is shown, and the saboteur is female.\n\nBennington – Technically mediocre; unlikely to have defeated the SSCU security circuitry or the inventory safeguards.  His prints on Erikson only place him at his own repair site, not in Stores or the shield bay.\n\nMaster-Sergeant O’Hennessey – Experienced logistician but male (finger is female), and his quarrel with Sgt. Bannick shows he expects to be vindicated, not desperate.\n\nTrader Scrivine – Alien, under continuous armed escort while in the military sector; never near the shield-generator compartment or Stores unattended, and lacks the human female biology that left the finger.\n\nTherefore only Lieutenant Erikson can be the saboteur.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Sgt. Hernandez, please go check where the lighting control units are stored. You will find the SSCU units there I believe. Arrest Valance and release the others. It is clear what happened. Scrivine could not have done it himself because he left the military sector right before the sabotage happened. O’Hennessey had no motive and Erikson and Bennington were obviously romantically attached, which is why Valance used Bennington to distract him.\nThe woman's finger shows us his motivation. An agent working for the Ravshek told him his wife was still alive. On the hope that the Ravshek would keep their word and free his wife and son, he agreed to carry out the sabotage when he was signaled to do so. Even though it was likely to mean his own death, either killed by the attacking Ravshek fleet or executed for treason. I think Scrivine signaled Valance that it was time to sabotage the shields by giving him his wife’s finger. Valance encouraged Bennington to seek out Erikson, offering to cover for him, thus freeing himself from observation.\nKnowing that Erikson was otherwise engaged, Valance first removed the SSCU from the shield generator compartment and then went to stores. He extracted the spare SSCU and two lighting controllers and then stored the two SSCUs under the code for the lighting controllers. He then deleted the log so that what he had done wouldn't be obvious. Needing to get back before Bennington, Valance was left with no choice but to hide the lighting controllers in the insulation. He knew that scanners set to locate SSCUs would not detect them.\nPhilips had a shield generated without structural control when the Ravshek launched a testing salvo of missiles. Confident their stratagem had worked, the Ravshek fleet had come in too close when the shield englobed the station, making it invulnerable. They were in the station's controlled missile range for two hours and thirty-seven minutes. Three battered survivors of the sixteen-strong Ravshek fleet escaped back into hyperspace.",

Cecilia keyed acceptance and his craggy face appeared on the screen. “Commander, we have multiple, unscheduled hyperspace arrivals. The timing is highly suspicious. We need full shield capability. They’ll reach controlled missile range in six hours. I need you to do your Sherlock Holmes act, Holman. First priority: find one of the control units. Second: find and lock down our saboteur.\" He paused a moment, then, \"Do your best, Ceci, we're relying on you.” “Aye, aye, Skipper!” Cecelia responded. Cutting the connection, Cecilia looked at her team leaders and began issuing orders. *** Two hours later, they gathered in the security conference room to review progress. “Sergeant Benson, your team had personnel checks. Status, please?” “Ma'am, 18 personnel have the expertise to remove the SSCU without setting off security alerts. Fifteen of these have alibis for the time period in question. The remaining three are Lt. Erikson’s duty techs, Valance and Bennington, and Master Sgt. O'Hennessey. I also brought in Lt. Erikson since she missed the alert. They’re all in detention, Ma'am.” “What do we have on their backgrounds?” “Nothing indicative, Ma'am. Valance was commended for bravery when the Ravshek took Herstog. His wife and son didn't get off-planet. He hates the Ravers – not a surprise since they eat human flesh! CIT has verified the incoming ships as Ravshek, so it's unlikely he's our saboteur. “He and Bennington were working on a control shunt in corridor B32 that has been causing problems for the last four days. Both have insulation smears on hands and uniform sleeves that confirm this and Valance says Bennington was there the whole time. They’re only still suspects because both have the capability and are each others' alibi.” “The others?” “O'Hennessey is in for his fourth five-year stretch. Excellent duty ratings, but some black marks for off-duty public brawling and operating a still.” “Erikson and Bennington?” “The lieutenant was a corporal, Ma'am, sent to OTC on the recommendation of her battalion CO Major Hilton. She was 47th in her class of 100. There's nothing official, but the secured section of her personnel dossier includes a suspicion that her relationship with the Major may have breeched fraternization regulations. “Bennington's ratings indicate a so-so technical ability; it's questionable he could have removed the SSCU without setting off alarms. He has a reputation as a ladies' man.” “I see. Have Erikson, Valance and Bennington placed in an interview room together and O’Hennessey in a separate interview room.\" Cecilia turned to her next team leader. “Sergeant Devallier, civilian activity?” “We've interviewed all civilians that entered the military sector bar one, a Villiasoo trader called Scrivine. He had a meeting with the quartermaster at 0300 hours; wanted to sell some luxury foodstuffs for the officer's mess. Came in on the 'Cheeanie' seven hours ago and requested an immediate meeting on the basis of a tight shipping schedule. He had a security detail from reception to the quartermaster's and back. He left the military sector at 0324 hours. Cpl. Devon, who led the detail, says Scrivine had no unescorted access anywhere. He confirms that Valance and Bennington who were working in corridor B32 when they passed. Scrivine did chat with and give samples to some of the crew, including Valance.” “Hmmm ... the Villiasoo are supposedly neutral, but I've heard they're more 'neutral' towards the Ravshek than to us. Sgt. Billings, what have you managed to put together from the logs?” “Ma'am, the SSCU was disabled at 0346 hours. Lt. Erikson was on duty but somehow missed it at that time. She posted her inventory request for the spare at 0401, in response to the 0400 maintenance report. The 0300 to 0400 inventory log was deleted, the 0200 to 0300 log archived normally and the 0400 to 0500 log initiated normally; but whoever removed the spare SSCU must have wiped the log. Inventory status can't be manually altered; the SSCU spare was there at 0300 and gone at 0400. Total parts count was reduced by three during that period. We’ve accounted for two. The third had to be the SSCU.” “Probably. Anything else?” “The last garbicle ejection from military sector was 17 hours ago. I let Hermes know straight off, Ma'am.” “Good. Sgt. Hernandez, search status?” “Ma'am, teams are searching all compartments, but it's going to take time. With Sgt. Billings' confirmation that the garbage hasn’t been frozen and ejected I've had a team scan the compartment. No components intrinsic to SSCUs were detected.” “I want an eyeball search, please, Sergeant.” “Aye aye, Ma'am.” “And have a security tech check the repair work in B32. I want to know about anything even minutely unusual.” *** Cecelia was at her workstation, reviewing video feeds from the brig. O'Hennessey had a visitor, a security sergeant who shouldn’t be there. She keyed the feed for sound. “...ring squad for you this time, Oh Hen-sick-be!” sneered the sergeant. “In your dreams, Bannick. With Sherlock in charge of the investigation, she'll find the saboteur, which sure as heck ain't me!” In the other room, Lieutenant Erikson was pacing while Valance and Bennington sat at the table. Erikson's uniform was immaculate until she turned round to pace the other way. Two handprints, the color of insulation foam and of a size to match Bennington’s, on her lower back marred the otherwise perfection. Cecelia’s comm buzzed. It was Sgt. Hernandez. “Ma'am, the team in the garbage disposal just found a woman's finger. It's been sent for DNA analysis. And the tech checking the repairs in B32 found two lighting controllers hidden in the insulation; they're brand new, still sealed in plastic wrap.” “Thank you, Hermes, that’s exactly what I needed to know.”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Cpl. Bennington; (b) Scrivine; (c) Sgt. O'Hennessey; (d) Sgt.Valance",
      "answer": "(d) Sgt.Valance",
      "outcome": "Sgt. Hernandez, please go check where the lighting control units are stored. You will find the SSCU units there I believe. Arrest Valance and release the others. It is clear what happened. Scrivine could not have done it himself because he left the military sector right before the sabotage happened. O’Hennessey had no motive and Erikson and Bennington were obviously romantically attached, which is why Valance used Bennington to distract him.\nThe woman's finger shows us his motivation. An agent working for the Ravshek told him his wife was still alive. On the hope that the Ravshek would keep their word and free his wife and son, he agreed to carry out the sabotage when he was signaled to do so. Even though it was likely to mean his own death, either killed by the attacking Ravshek fleet or executed for treason. I think Scrivine signaled Valance that it was time to sabotage the shields by giving him his wife’s finger. Valance encouraged Bennington to seek out Erikson, offering to cover for him, thus freeing himself from observation.\nKnowing that Erikson was otherwise engaged, Valance first removed the SSCU from the shield generator compartment and then went to stores. He extracted the spare SSCU and two lighting controllers and then stored the two SSCUs under the code for the lighting controllers. He then deleted the log so that what he had done wouldn't be obvious. Needing to get back before Bennington, Valance was left with no choice but to hide the lighting controllers in the insulation. He knew that scanners set to locate SSCUs would not detect them.\nPhilips had a shield generated without structural control when the Ravshek launched a testing salvo of missiles. Confident their stratagem had worked, the Ravshek fleet had come in too close when the shield englobed the station, making it invulnerable. They were in the station's controlled missile range for two hours and thirty-seven minutes. Three battered survivors of the sixteen-strong Ravshek fleet escaped back into hyperspace."
