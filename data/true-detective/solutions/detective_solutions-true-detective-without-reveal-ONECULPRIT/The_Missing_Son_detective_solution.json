    "full_text": "As Amanda fixed breakfast for her four sons, she thought this Wednesday morning in May was truly a gift from God. It was already warm with bright sunshine and no clouds in the sky. But Amanda knew the boys were tired. She felt sorry for her husband Warren this morning. He had left early to spend the day with his father, as last night his mother had passed away. The family had been notified of her heart attack just after dinner, and they spent the rest of the evening at the hospital. Amanda was grateful they all had the opportunity to say goodbye to her before she slipped into quiet sleep. They arrived home late. “No wonder the boys look fatigued”, she thought. “It’s been a trying time for us all.” Amanda looked affectionately at her four boys as they hurriedly ate breakfast. Connor, at eighteen, was the oldest. He was what she called her feisty one. Until Coach Hastings at Upstate College had offered him a full athletic scholarship for next year, Connor had been lackadaisical in study habits and class attendance. Hastings was known as a no-nonsense coach who demanded the same effort in the classroom as he did on the football field. He also expected good citizenship from his players and those who could not stay out of trouble off the field needn’t worry about spending any time on it. Amanda had been pleased with the dramatic turnaround in her oldest son this year; Connor was doing everything he could to please both Coach Hastings and the faculty at Lee School. Caleb, sixteen years old, was her studious son. He was just finishing his sophomore year at Lee School and had maintained a perfect 4.0 grade average since commencing middle school. Caleb hoped to be a research scientist someday and possessed the analytical and perfectionist attitude that persons in that field must have to succeed. Amanda often worried about his over-developed sense of perfection as there had been times Caleb had overworked himself to his own detriment. Caleb would literally do anything to succeed. Caleb looked worried this morning, but, didn’t he always? Amanda hoped that his first hour gym class would perk him up—Wednesday tended to be a pop quiz day. Amanda considered Jordan, age fourteen. Jordan did not enjoy the robust health her other sons did. Jordan suffered from Hypoglycemia and it was no minor ailment with him, as he had been known to pass out at unexpected times. Amanda prayed that he would one day grow out of this. However, she took comfort in the fact that Jordan usually took pretty good care of himself. He watched carefully what he ate and drank, and monitored his exercise closely. Still, he could get dizzy and lightheaded at the oddest of times, especially when he overdid it. There had been several occasions in which the school nurse called, saying he arrived at school feeling weak and faint. The youngest was Kyle. Kyle was twelve and in his first year at Lee. Kyle was her current “problem” child. He was experiencing attention span problems and not doing too well in school. However, while Kyle was currently getting poor grades, he wasn’t a troublemaker—he had a healthy desire to get along with his teachers and the vice principal. Amanda wryly wished he had the same desire to get along with his report card. Her husband, Warren, had been like that when Kyle’s age, so she hoped it would not be a long term problem. Amanda continued to think of Kyle. Lee School was a place where an uninterested student could fail quickly. Pop quizzes, which were given frequently—usually either on Monday or Wednesday and often, both—carried as much weight as Friday tests and semester exams. This was of many reasons that Lee was the top school in the state, academically speaking. Amanda considered it fortunate that Lee was both a middle and high school. It was even better that the school was scarcely half a mile down the block from their home. Unless the weather was severely wet or cold, the boys walked together the short distance to school. She liked the fact that the path was well traveled, as many neighborhood children walked to school past their house. It was also well patrolled, as there were crossing guards at two key intersections, plus a police squad car that sat in the parking lot of the Elizabeth Toland Branch Library in the mornings and afternoons, monitoring both the behavior of the children and the street traffic. Amanda put all of her thoughts and cares behind her as she kissed each son goodbye. She watched them walk briskly down the sidewalk until out of sight. Stepping back into the house, she thought again, What a pretty day. During the middle of the morning, the telephone rang. It was Marge Schroeder, the Lee School receptionist. Marge knew Amanda well from Connor’s time as a habitual occupant of the vice principal’s office. She said, “Good morning, Amanda. One of your sons did not make it to first hour. We don’t know where he is” Amanda thought for a moment. Finally, she said to Marge, “I know who it was without you having to say. I’ll see you in a minute.” She told Marge who she suspected had skipped class and, before the startled Marge could answer, Amanda hung up and headed out the door.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What did the school say?  \n   “One of your sons did not make it to first hour. We don’t know where he is.”\n\n2. How did Amanda answer?  \n   “I know who it was …” and she added that he had “skipped class.”  \n   That means she believed the absence was deliberate truancy, not an accident or a medical emergency.\n\n3. Analyse each boy:\n\n• Connor (18) – Used to cut classes but has completely re-formed this year because a full athletic scholarship depends on perfect citizenship and attendance. Losing that scholarship is far too high a price; he has every reason to be in class and none to skip.\n\n• Caleb (16) – A straight-A perfectionist who would “literally do anything to succeed.” Wednesday is usually “pop-quiz day,” and Caleb has first-hour gym. A student who strives for absolute academic perfection is not going to throw away marks or perfect attendance by skipping.  Besides, a gym class is not a threatening pop quiz.\n\n• Jordan (14) – Suffers from hypoglycaemia and sometimes faints, but that is a medical problem, not truancy.  If Jordan had collapsed on the way to school, the crossing guards, the parked police officer or one of the many pupils on the route would already have reported it.  Amanda’s use of the word “skipped” shows she does not think it is Jordan’s medical condition.\n\n• Kyle (12) – The only son who is doing poorly academically.  Pop quizzes at Lee count as much as full tests; Wednesday is one of the two main quiz days; Kyle went to bed late after an exhausting evening at the hospital and almost certainly is unprepared for yet another heavily-weighted quiz.  With a beautiful warm May morning calling, a nervous, under-prepared twelve-year-old has both motive (avoiding a quiz he expects to fail) and opportunity (he can slip away after the last crossing-guard is behind him; no one inside the building sees him arrive).\n\n4. Amanda’s reasoning: Only one boy has both a reason to skip and a past history consistent with doing poorly in class.  That boy is Kyle.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nConnor, Caleb, Jordan, Kyle\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nKyle\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOn the walk to school the four brothers stayed together only as far as the second crossing guard.  Once the older boys were chatting among themselves Kyle let himself drift to the back of the group, then turned off at the corner of Maple and Elm.  Knowing that Wednesday usually brings a pop quiz worth a large share of his grade—and knowing he was in no shape to pass it after the late, emotional night at the hospital—he decided to play hooky.\n\nHe cut through the small park behind the Elizabeth Toland Branch Library, staying out of the sight-line of the patrol car parked in the library lot, and headed for one of the neighbourhood hang-outs (most likely the Convenience-Mart or the public playground).  Because he left the main foot-traffic route after the crossing-guard zone, no adult immediately noticed that he had broken away.  When first-hour attendance was taken he was the only Reynolds* boy missing.  The receptionist telephoned Amanda, who instantly realised that the only son with any motive this morning was Kyle.\n(*Family surname never stated; “Reynolds” used here only as a placeholder.)\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nConnor: A single unexcused absence could cost him a full athletic scholarship and a place on Coach Hastings’ team.  His recent reformation makes it implausible that he would jeopardise everything for one morning off.\n\nCaleb: A fanatic for perfect marks and perfect attendance.  Skipping class would undermine the 4.0 average he has maintained for years.  His first class is gym, so the usual Wednesday “pop-quiz threat” does not even apply to him.\n\nJordan: If Jordan vanished, Amanda would have worried about a medical incident, not truancy.  Her use of the word “skipped” shows she knew the absence was intentional.  Moreover, any medical collapse on the well-patrolled route would have been reported immediately by guards or the police officer.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
