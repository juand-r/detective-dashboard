    "full_text": "I was sleeping the little sleep – napping – when a tall, blonde ankled into my office. “Well, my lunch was stolen again today!” he bleated, planting his slender hands on his slender hips, staring petulantly down at me. “Second time this week!” I pawed sand out of my eyes, cursing the casual office attire policy that allowed men to wear shorts at work. “What’d ya want me to do about it?” I gritted, shuffling some blank papers around on my desk like I was busy. Andreas Scolari, our one-man accounts payable department, huffed, “I expect you to find out who the thief is. You are the office manager, aren’t you?” I didn’t like people telling me my job (after all, it was spelled out in big black letters on my door). “Yeah, Skip Trace, office manager,” I growled, “that’s me. Don’t sweat it, Andreas, I’ll track down the chowhound who put the bite on your lunch.” At least I’d have something to sink my teeth into for the rest of the day. After getting the details on his missing food, I gave Andreas a five-dollar chit out of petty cash, good for a crust of bread and a glass of water down at the soup kitchen two blocks over. Then I put my dogs into motion, cornering Beryl Hives at her reception desk out front. Beryl was 63 going on 200. She had a smoky voice and a smoky pair of eyes -- courtesy of way too many cigarettes. She had a chip on her shoulder the size of her beehive hairdo. But she knew the goings-on in our small business office like nobody else. “Who’s been in the office this morning, Beryl?” I jawed, leaning up against her elevated countertop. I knew that Andreas Scolari had gotten into work at 9:00 a.m., and that his lunch break start-time had been 1:00 p.m. So his brown bagger must’ve been lifted from the company breakroom fridge sometime between those two times. An egg salad sandwich, an apple, an orange and a milk chocolate bar. “Pete, Dawn, Andreas, and Konrad,” Beryl rasped in reply to my question. “And you. Why?” “Andreas lost his lunch again today,” I yammered. She hacked out a laugh, phlegmy-like. “At least I won’t have to listen to him chomping on those apples of his, then. You can hear him crunching away in the lunchroom all the way up here!” “Yeah, life’s tough,” I agreed, sweet-talking the old lady. “But you know what they say, an apple a day-” I choked on my quote when I saw Beryl stick two of her nicotine-stained fingers into her mouth to rattle her falsies around. “Dentures can’t take ‘em – too hard,” she informed me. I barely kept my lunch down. And I hadn’t even eaten yet. “When’d you chow down?” I wheezed. “I had a half a pack of Camels outside at my usual time – noon to 1:00.” Armed with the list of names Beryl had provided, I trundled away from the reception area and down the hall, crowded up behind Pete Stampkowski at the snack machine. The plus-sized salesman was overindulging one of his many weaknesses again – junk food. “Had lunch yet, big guy?” I mouthed. He yanked the sisters Sweet Marie and Baby Ruth out of the bottom of the machine and straightened up with an ‘oof’. A grin split his heavy jowls. “Hey, Skip! Lunch? Yeah, sure, just got back – wining and dining Larry Kolger of LK Industries. We went to the Weiner Hut on Broadway. You been there lately? They got a-” “What time did you inhale the foot-longs and fries?” I interrupted, fingering the fresh mustard and gravy stains on the guy’s shirt. The last time Pete Stampkowski had eaten anything healthy was the time he’d scarfed down a bagful of Styrofoam packing worms, thinking they were white-cheese doodles. “Oh, we were there from around 11:45 ‘til now, I guess. I just got back. Say, you wanna hear something funny-” I left Pete to swallow his longwinded story, slipping past him and through the side door, out into the sunshine. I spotted Dawn de Jong stretching her legs, and I briefly shadowed her. Then flat-out ran to catch up with the well-toned payroll clerk striding down the sidewalk pumping her arms and legs. “Another walking lunch, sugar?” I puffed. “You know I never eat lunch, Skip,” she said, barely breathing hard. “I have all the fruits and nuts and water I need at my desk at work.” She turned her head and shone her violet eyes on me, smiling. I went weak in the knees. The shin splints I got all on my own. “How ‘bout making with the milk of human kindness and going out with me some time?” I gasped. She quickened her pace, leaving me in the dust. “Sorry,” she tossed over her shoulder, “but I’m lactose intolerant.” I collected my thoughts, and breath, and shouldered my way back into the office. I set up shop in the conference room, picked up the phone, punched up Konrad Pushkin’s cubicle. “Konrad, it’s your wife!” I warbled in my best falsetto. Imitations were one of my specialties, and I’d met Konrad’s distinctively high-pitched wife at last year’s Christmas party. “Yeah?” came the exasperated reply. Konrad was the company’s accounts receivable collector, a dour, hard-faced man with an attitude as stony as the Kremlin. And with good reason – he had seven children at home, and a job that barely put enough food in everyone’s mouth. “I need you to stop at the market on your way home and pick up a few hundred items!” I shrilled. He grunted, “I already gave you the food money for the week. There ain’t anymore!” I set the trap. “Weeell … can’t you maybe take up a collection at work – of food? There must be some lying around in the-” The trap snapped back in my face, the sharp clicking sound of Konrad angrily cutting the line leaving me speechless. For all his flinty faults, the guy did have a reputation for honesty and integrity. I ambled back outside to mull things over. But the hot summer sun didn’t burn off the fog surrounding my brain. Until I wandered into the parking lot out back and leaned up against the dumpster, and my nose started twitching. That’s when I knew it was time to get dirty. Before this case ate me up. So, I followed my beak, right over the side and into the bungalow-sized garbage container. And after only a few minutes of smelly sifting, I found what I was searching for: A brown paper bag containing a collection of bread crusts, a shiny red apple, a fistful of orange peels and one very empty milk chocolate bar wrapper. Evidence! I climbed out of the dumpster with my haul and tumbled to the pavement. Triumphantly! Knowing that I’d have the food burglar regurgitating a confession in no time.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Fix the time-window of the theft  \n   • Andreas arrived 9:00 a.m. and did not open his bag until 1:00 p.m.  \n   • The lunch had to be taken between 9:00 and 1:00.\n\n2. List everyone who was in the building during (part of) that interval  \n   • Andreas Scolari – the victim.  \n   • Beryl Hives – receptionist, at her desk 9:00-12:00, outside smoking 12:00-1:00.  \n   • Pete Stampkowski – salesman, at work 9:00-11:45, then out for a restaurant lunch.  \n   • Dawn de Jong – payroll clerk, at her desk all morning, left at 1:00 to power-walk.  \n   • Konrad Pushkin – collector, at his cubicle all morning.  \n   • Skip Trace – narrator, but he is our detective.\n\n3. Check physical evidence found in the dumpster  \n   • Brown paper bag from Andreas.  \n   • Crusts of an egg-salad sandwich (soft bread removed).  \n   • Orange peels – the orange was eaten.  \n   • EMPTY milk-chocolate wrapper – chocolate was eaten.  \n   • COMPLETE, SHINY, UNBITTEN APPLE – the apple was NOT eaten.\n\n4. Match the evidence to what each person would or would not eat  \n   • Beryl explicitly says her dentures “can’t take ’em – too hard” (apples).  \n     She could eat the soft egg-salad, the chocolate and the orange, then dump the untouched apple.  \n   • Pete will eat almost anything; he certainly has no trouble with apples.  \n     If Pete had taken the lunch the apple would be gone.  \n   • Dawn claims she subsists on “fruits and nuts and water” and is lactose-intolerant.  \n     She would have eaten the apple and orange and left the chocolate, the opposite of the evidence.  \n   • Konrad has seven hungry children; if he stole food he would take everything home, not throw it out.  \n     The whole bag would be missing, not half-eaten in a dumpster.  \n   • Beryl is also the only one who was outside beside the dumpster (her smoke break) during the crucial period for disposing of the evidence.\n\n5. Motive  \n   • Beryl is irritated by Andreas’s noisy apple-crunching (“At least I won’t have to listen to him chomping on those apples of his”).  \n   • She can’t afford a proper lunch on her meagre salary and cigarettes; stealing a soft sandwich and chocolate satisfies her hunger.\n\n6. Opportunity  \n   • Beryl sits at the front desk, sees everyone come and go, and can slip into the break-room unnoticed when it is empty.  \n   • Between 12:00 and 1:00 she is already outside, the perfect moment to toss the incriminating bag into the rear dumpster.\n\nTherefore the only person whose motive, opportunity, and eating limitations fit every single clue is Beryl Hives, the receptionist.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBeryl Hives, Pete Stampkowski, Dawn de Jong, Konrad Pushkin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nBeryl Hives\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly in the morning Beryl left her reception post for a minute, slipped into the break-room, opened the refrigerator and removed Andreas Scolari’s brown-bag lunch.  \nShe took it back to her desk, ate the egg-salad sandwich (discarding the crusts, which were too chewy), peeled and ate the orange, and unwrapped and devoured the milk-chocolate bar. Because her dentures make biting hard foods painful, she left the apple untouched.  \nWhen her regular noon-to-one smoking break arrived, she carried the now-half-empty paper bag outside with her cigarettes. Walking past the rear dumpster, she tossed the incriminating remains inside, then stood out front having her smoke as usual.  \nSkip later found the bag, apple, crusts, orange peels and chocolate wrapper right where Beryl had discarded them, confirming her guilt.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nPete Stampkowski – Was away between 11:45 and after 1:00 at a restaurant with a client; if he had taken the lunch earlier he would have eaten everything, apple included.  \nDawn de Jong – Eats only “fruits and nuts and water” and is lactose-intolerant; the chocolate was eaten and the apple left, the reverse of what Dawn would do.  \nKonrad Pushkin – Needs food for his seven children; he would have taken the whole lunch home instead of half-eating it and dumping the rest; moreover he refused the very idea of begging food from the office when Skip posed as his wife.  \nOnly Beryl’s dentures-related inability to bite apples, her dislike of Andreas’s apple-munching, her presence in the office all morning, and her being outside next to the dumpster at noon align perfectly with the physical evidence and timeline, leaving her as the sole logical culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Yeah, sure, just got back – wining and dining Larry Kolger of LK Industries. We went to the Weiner Hut on Broadway. You been there lately? They got a-” “What time did you inhale the foot-longs and fries?” I interrupted, fingering the fresh mustard and gravy stains on the guy’s shirt. The last time Pete Stampkowski had eaten anything healthy was the time he’d scarfed down a bagful of Styrofoam packing worms, thinking they were white-cheese doodles. “Oh, we were there from around 11:45 ‘til now, I guess. I just got back. Say, you wanna hear something funny-” I left Pete to swallow his longwinded story, slipping past him and through the side door, out into the sunshine. I spotted Dawn de Jong stretching her legs, and I briefly shadowed her. Then flat-out ran to catch up with the well-toned payroll clerk striding down the sidewalk pumping her arms and legs. “Another walking lunch, sugar?” I puffed. “You know I never eat lunch, Skip,” she said, barely breathing hard. “I have all the fruits and nuts and water I need at my desk at work.” She turned her head and shone her violet eyes on me, smiling. I went weak in the knees. The shin splints I got all on my own. “How ‘bout making with the milk of human kindness and going out with me some time?” I gasped. She quickened her pace, leaving me in the dust. “Sorry,” she tossed over her shoulder, “but I’m lactose intolerant.” I collected my thoughts, and breath, and shouldered my way back into the office. I set up shop in the conference room, picked up the phone, punched up Konrad Pushkin’s cubicle. “Konrad, it’s your wife!” I warbled in my best falsetto. Imitations were one of my specialties, and I’d met Konrad’s distinctively high-pitched wife at last year’s Christmas party. “Yeah?” came the exasperated reply. Konrad was the company’s accounts receivable collector, a dour, hard-faced man with an attitude as stony as the Kremlin. And with good reason – he had seven children at home, and a job that barely put enough food in everyone’s mouth. “I need you to stop at the market on your way home and pick up a few hundred items!” I shrilled. He grunted, “I already gave you the food money for the week. There ain’t anymore!” I set the trap. “Weeell … can’t you maybe take up a collection at work – of food? There must be some lying around in the-” The trap snapped back in my face, the sharp clicking sound of Konrad angrily cutting the line leaving me speechless. For all his flinty faults, the guy did have a reputation for honesty and integrity. I ambled back outside to mull things over. But the hot summer sun didn’t burn off the fog surrounding my brain. Until I wandered into the parking lot out back and leaned up against the dumpster, and my nose started twitching. That’s when I knew it was time to get dirty. Before this case ate me up. So, I followed my beak, right over the side and into the bungalow-sized garbage container. And after only a few minutes of smelly sifting, I found what I was searching for: A brown paper bag containing a collection of bread crusts, a shiny red apple, a fistful of orange peels and one very empty milk chocolate bar wrapper. Evidence! I climbed out of the dumpster with my haul and tumbled to the pavement. Triumphantly! Knowing that I’d have the food burglar regurgitating a confession in no time.",

      "outcome": "I strode back into the office and dumped the contents of the crumpled lunch sack on Andreas’ desktop. “Recognize these remains?” I jibbered.\nHe wrinkled his nose and pushed his chair away. “Yes, it looks like what’s left of my … lunch.”\n“Exactly!” I snarled. “With everything eaten down to the core except for this apple!” I picked up the crunchy fruit.\nAndreas stared at me. “So?”\n“So, there’re two people in this office who have apples on their natural enemies list – Pete Stampkowski and Beryl Hives.” I scooped up the orange peels, let them flutter back down to the desk. “And Pete wouldn’t eat an orange unless it was the chocolate kind you whack on a table to open. Not to mention, he was dining out with a client today.”\n“Why, that old-”\n“Easy, kid,” I cautioned. “Let me digest the rest of this case. I’ll get Beryl to cough you up an apology.”"
