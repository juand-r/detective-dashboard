    "full_text": "Andersonville Military Prison, deep in the heart of Dixieland Georgia, was the most dreaded of Confederate prisoner-of-war camps. It was such a grim place that the rebel soldiers guarding it were fed and clothed little better than their 33,000 Yankee prisoners. From its inception in February 1864, until the Civil War’s end 14 months later, 13,000 prisoners would die; an astonishing 29% mortality rate. Many of the Union soldiers succumbed to starvation and exposure to the elements, but some were also murdered, as was the case with Private Glendenning Bryan. Sgt. Crosby, Sgt. Thornton, Pvt. Whisenant and Cpl. Horner shared a tent with Pvt. Bryan – if you could call a few small tree limbs that served as poles, plus a few tattered blankets and threadbare shirts, shelter at all. Because the tent was so small, privacy was virtually non-existent, and this only added to the shock and dismay when the friendly Bryan, a young 19-year-old from Boston, was found dead with a knife wound in his stomach when the sun came up early one steamy Monday morning in August 1864. Crosby, the 38-year-old no-nonsense senior non-commissioned officer and Chicago, Illinois, policeman, took charge. Speaking within the confines of the small tent, he said, “He’s murdered, murdered right here. I don’t know why, he would’ve been dead in a few days anyway.” Bryan had been in Andersonville the longest and was the most malnourished and sickest of the five. However, they soon discovered why Bryan had been killed. He had been hoarding food in his clothing, planning to eat it when he felt better. Inside his trousers they found a crudely sewn, hidden pocket that contained breadcrumbs and a few tiny pieces of salt pork. The likable Bryan had been killed for food. “Well, it wasn’t me that did it,” said the short-tempered Horner, another native of Massachusetts, as he viewed his friend who lay dead just inches from his bare feet. “My hands are useless with arthritis and I can’t hardly hold a knife.” Horner was 40-years-old and had spent too many years shoeing horses in the cold weather of his home in Worcester. “It couldn’t have been me,’ chimed in Thornton. “I was outside walking most of the night.” “Most of the night is not all of the night,” Crosby pointedly replied. Thornton, a 26-year-old librarian from Philadelphia and quietest of the residents of the tent, winced at this suggestion. “Did anyone see you?” asked Crosby. Thornton looked at each man in turn before answering, “Nobody saw me, but I was out walking last night. I was.” “I was sick, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, so I was down by the sinks all night,” offered Whisenant, the normally amiable 30-year-old New York school teacher. “I got back here just a few minutes ago.” Crosby hadn’t slept in the tent the previous night, either, and told them so. “I was at the other end of the camp, trying to get what fresh night air was available.” That was an ironic statement, as it was known that the stench from Andersonville was so severe it was noticed in the city of Americus, several miles away. “I didn’t notice any of you fellers last night. Just me and Bryan,” said Horner, thinking out loud. Slowly, he asked, “Who owns the knife?” “Answer that and we have our killer,” Thornton added, dryly. For a few minutes they all sat in silence. Finally, Crosby said, “I got back here first. I found Horner asleep and Bryan dead.” Horner shot Crosby a mean look, pointed a gnarled finger at him and said, “I told you I didn’t kill him!” He winced in pain as he did so. “Easy, corporal, easy, I’m just thinking.” “Well, for whatever it’s worth to you, I didn’t sleep well,” Horner said. “Who does in this place? I was asleep for only an hour or two and did not see or hear anything, except the usual camp noises.” “OK, let’s continue,” said Crosby. “I was on the other side of the camp with various friends; not with any one person the entire night, but I was never alone.” Turning to Thornton, he asked, “What about you? Horner didn’t sleep well, says he didn’t see you.” “He probably didn’t. I only came back to the tent a couple of times. When I heard him snoring, I did not go in. I didn’t want to bother him. The last time was about an hour ago. It was too dark to notice anything unusual about Bryan.” Crosby digested this for a moment and then asked Whisenant, “You were sick last night?” “Right,” he replied. The sight and shock of the dead Bryan did nothing to quiet his queasiness, although he was a butcher by trade in his hometown of Zeeland, Michigan. With great effort, he managed to control a wave of nausea. He needed to go outside and Crosby excused him. Whisenant returned a few minutes later, weak but feeling better. He dreaded resuming the conversation, but he re-seated himself in the cramped tent and looked at Crosby. Finally, Crosby stated bluntly, “I know who killed Bryan.”",

The logical deduction from the clues presented\n\nSolve the mystery. Write down your thought process here.\n\n<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n<thought process here>\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\nWho are the possible suspects? List them here:\n\n<SUSPECTS>\n<names(s) for all suspects here, comma separated>\n</SUSPECTS>\n\nWho is the culprit?  There is only one. If possible, include first and last names, as well as any aliases. Answer in the form:\n\n<CULPRIT>\n<name here>\n</CULPRIT>\n\nNow write down your reconstruction of the events of what actually happened.\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n<event reconstruction here>\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\nFinally, explain why the other suspects are innocent.\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n<explanation here>\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What must the murderer have?\n   – The knife.  Nothing in the story says the weapon was ever recovered.\n   – If the knife was still in the tent when the body was found, Crosby would have produced it\n     at once.  Instead he asks, “Who owns the knife?”  Therefore it is not there, and whoever\n     killed Bryan is still carrying it when the men begin talking.\n\n2. Who, after the discovery, is given the chance to get rid of the knife?\n   – Only one man: Pvt. Whisenant.  \n     • He complains of nausea, is excused, leaves the tent alone for “a few minutes,” then\n       returns.  \n     • During those unsupervised minutes he can easily drop a small knife into the latrine\n       trench (“the sinks”) or bury it in the loose Georgia soil.\n\n3. Motive and ability.\n   – Bryan was knifed for food.  \n   – Whisenant’s trade is butchery (the narrator tells us he is “a butcher by trade in his\n     hometown of Zeeland, Michigan”), so he both knows knives well and is used to cutting meat.\n   – As a starving prisoner, a few scraps of salt pork would be exceptionally tempting.\n\n4. Opportunity before the body was discovered.\n   – Whisenant claims he was “down by the sinks all night.”  No one can confirm that.  He could\n     have slipped back to the tent, killed Bryan, returned to the sinks, and strolled in again\n     “just a few minutes ago.”\n\n5. Why not the others?\n   – Crosby never leaves the tent after the body is found, so he cannot dispose of a knife he\n     would still be holding.\n   – Thornton does not leave either; if he had the knife it would still be on him.  Crosby would\n     have demanded a search and found it.\n   – Horner is arthritic, was discovered asleep beside the corpse, and likewise never leaves the\n     tent after the discovery.  He has no chance to rid himself of a weapon.\n\n6. Crosby’s silent deduction.\n   – As a veteran Chicago policeman he notices that only one man had the chance to rid himself\n     of evidence once the inquiry began.  When Whisenant returns, empty-handed and “feeling\n     better,” Crosby can state, “I know who killed Bryan.” \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSgt. Crosby, Sgt. Thornton, Pvt. Whisenant, Cpl. Horner\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nPrivate Whisenant\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate Sunday night Whisenant prowled back to the tent, discovered Bryan’s hidden food pocket,\nand decided to take it.  Bryan woke, struggled, and Whisenant – an experienced butcher with a\nsmall knife always on him – stabbed the weakened youth in the stomach.  He snatched a few\nmorsels, then hurried back toward the sinks, believing no one had seen him.  At dawn the body\nwas found; a quick search did not locate the knife because Whisenant still had it tucked away.\nWhen Crosby began questioning everyone, Whisenant felt certain the knife would be sought, so\nhe feigned a fresh bout of nausea.  Allowed to leave the tent, he slipped the weapon into the\nlatrine trench and returned.  Having watched him create the only chance to dispose of the\nknife, Crosby realized Whisenant had to be the murderer. \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSgt. Crosby – He discovered the body and never left the tent afterward, so he could not have\ngotten rid of the knife that still had to be in the killer’s possession when the inquiry\nstarted.\n\nSgt. Thornton – His only suspicious element is a vague alibi, but once the corpse was found he\nremained under Crosby’s eye.  If he had the knife it would still be on him.\n\nCpl. Horner – Arthritis limits his grip, he was asleep when Crosby entered, and, like the\nothers, he never left the tent after discovery; no chance to ditch a weapon.\n\nOnly Whisenant both had an unverifiable alibi for the night of the killing and, crucially,\nobtained the lone opportunity to dispose of the missing knife.  Therefore he, and he alone,\nmust be Bryan’s killer.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
