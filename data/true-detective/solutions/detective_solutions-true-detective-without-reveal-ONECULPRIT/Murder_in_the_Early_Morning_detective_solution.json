    "full_text": "Melody Kairns was usually the first person out of bed in the mornings. However, on this cool, spring morning in Oklahoma, she was still in bed at nine. All others in the Kairns household slept late that day, so they would say, and did not notice Melody’s absence from the kitchen until Nancy, the last person to arise, voiced her concern. It fell to Vernon, Melody’s husband of twenty-four years, to return to the bedroom and check on his wife. He found Melody, a handsome woman of forty-four years, dead and mostly unmarked. The only noticeable evidence of foul play was a small, round head wound near her temple, crusted over with a small amount of dried blood. She looked like she was peacefully asleep, which Vernon considered was quite unlike her, as she was usually a noisy, restless sleeper. Vernon, before allowing himself to go into panic, felt her cold wrist. There was no pulse—it was evident she had been dead for several hours. The coroner would later say that she had been dead for approximately seven hours, placing the murder at sometime around two in the morning. Mercifully, the murder weapon, later discovered to be an ice pick, missing from the kitchen, killed her quickly. There was no blood on Melody’s body or bed sheets. But the case stumped the family and police. Several weeks passed, and spring gave way to a hot summer. Vernon invited his sister-in-law Constance, a widow who lived in Texas, to visit for the first time since her sister had been murdered. Constance had been vacationing, staying with the Kairns family, the week that her sister died. She was nearly inconsolable, and Vernon sent her home soon after Melody’s funeral. Constance had little use for Vernon, whom she suspected of womanizing and felt didn’t apply himself to his career and family as he should, but she appreciated the chance to see her niece and nephew again, her last connections to her sister. She and Melody had been close when they were children, even with a seven-year age difference. They had shared a bedroom in their family’s small, east Texas farmhouse when growing up, and also shared all of their hopes, dreams and secrets. Constance recalled those days with fondness but did not entirely miss them, for Melody suffered lifelong sinus trouble and snored loudly, making sound sleep impossible for her until the day she was murdered. That Constance had extremely sensitive hearing only made matters worse, as she, too, experienced lifelong sleeping problems. Still, they had been more than sisters; they were soul mates. Melody’s death had been extremely hard on her. The morning she arrived, just after breakfast, Vernon gathered all of the family into the spacious den. It was the first time since that horrible day they had all been together in one room. After a few minutes of awkward small talk, Vernon cleared his throat and stated, “One of us murdered Melody.” He could barely utter the words and hated what the children must be thinking and going through. But, the police were stumped by the case, and it was apparent that they would get nowhere in the investigation unless one of the family remembered a detail about the night they’d previously forgotten. Vernon explained that the police had encouraged him to bring them together to talk about Melody’s murder again, with Constance present this time. He was not really confident any of them would remember something previously overlooked, but wanted to give it a try. He then asked, “Did anyone see or hear anything out of the ordinary the night she died?” The Kairns house was a big two story and well insulated. Sound did not carry well in it and Vernon was not surprised when nobody replied in the affirmative. John said, “I came home around midnight; I had been out with friends. All the lights were out and I assumed everyone was in bed. I went to the den and watched TV. It must have been three or so before I went upstairs to bed.” Nancy offered, “I was on the phone in my room, with the door closed. Beth and I didn’t quit talking until two-thirty or so.” Nancy gave her father a guilty look, as she knew he disapproved of her late night calls with her talkative best friend Beth Jameson. Vernon then turned to Constance. Barely hiding his animosity, he asked, “And what about you?” Constance smiled thinly, and answered, “I went to bed before midnight and didn’t see or talk to anyone again until next morning. She paused, and then said to John, “I thought about coming downstairs to watch television with you, but I could tell that you were watching one of those Friday the 13th-type movies. You all know how I hate violence with guns and knives.” Turning to Vernon, she said, “I didn’t hear anything from your room all night long.” Constance and Vernon looked at each other. Icily, she asked, “So what about you?” Vernon replied, “I went to bed at eleven-thirty. I vaguely recall hearing John come in downstairs as I was drifting off to a deep sleep. That’s the last thing I remember before awaking the next morning.” He shook, and his voice cracked when saying, “I didn’t notice anything wrong when I got up. I’m always groggy before morning coffee.” Nancy asked her father, “You don’t really believe John or I killed Mom, do you? She nervously glanced at Constance and said, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you killed Mom.” Nancy’s cheeks were rosy red from embarrassment. Constance answered, softly, “Don’t worry about it, dear. I know what you are going through.” Vernon appreciated his sister-in-law’s gentling handling of his troubled daughter, but that did not stop him from saying, “You are the only one who cannot account for your presence during the window of time Melody … left us.” He could not bring himself to use the word “murder” again. Constance thought a long moment, sadness washing over her as she looked at Vernon and Melody’s sweet children. Before speaking, she silently cursed, “Oh, how I hate it’s come to this!” But then she spoke, saying to all of them, “No, I cannot account for my time. I don’t have to because it doesn’t make any difference. The game is up.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  Vernon – no clear gain and still in the same bed; nothing points to a quarrel.  \n   •  John – no motive at all is suggested; he was on good terms with his mother.  \n   •  Nancy – ditto.  \n   •  Constance – she openly disliked Vernon and pitied her sister’s life with him; more\n      importantly, her entire life she had been kept awake by Melody’s thunderous snoring.  \n      If Melody died, Constance would at last have quiet—and she would also “rescue” her\n      sister from what she thought was an unhappy marriage.\n\n2.  Opportunity / alibis  \n   •  Vernon – claims to have been asleep from 11:30 p.m. on; John corroborates hearing him\n      snoring.  \n   •  John – was downstairs watching TV from about 12:10 a.m.-3:00 a.m. (he came in at\n      midnight).  During that time the killer entered an upstairs bedroom, stabbed Melody,\n      left no blood on the sheets and was unheard by John.  John would have had to leave the\n      TV, go upstairs, murder his mother, clean himself and return—unlikely in a few-minute\n      absence that neither the TV nor Constance noticed.  \n   •  Nancy – was on the telephone in her bedroom until 2:30 a.m.; Beth Jameson can verify\n      the call.  That covers the very window the coroner gave for the murder.  \n   •  Constance – “I went to bed before midnight and didn’t see or talk to anyone again.”\n      She alone has no witness or phone record for the critical hours.\n\n3.  Physical / acoustic evidence  \n   •  Melody was famous for loud, relentless snoring.  Vernon mentions that the corpse looks\n      “peacefully asleep,” which he says is “quite unlike her, as she was usually a noisy,\n      restless sleeper.”  \n   •  Constance has “extremely sensitive hearing” and had shared a room with Melody as a\n      child; her lifelong complaint was that Melody’s snoring kept her awake.  \n   •  Yet Constance calmly tells the family, “I didn’t hear anything from your room all\n      night long.”\n\n   These two facts cannot both be true unless Melody was already dead (and therefore no\n   longer snoring) before Constance settled down for the night.\n\n4.  Logical deduction  \n   •  The coroner’s 2 a.m. time-of-death is approximate (“about seven hours earlier”); a\n      variance of even ninety minutes is common in such estimates.  \n   •  Constance admits lying awake long enough to identify that John was watching a violent\n      “Friday-the-13th-type” film, even though she had allegedly gone to bed before midnight.\n      To know that, she had to be awake after John came home.  \n   •  Since the house is “well-insulated” and Constance could nevertheless distinguish the\n      kind of movie downstairs, she certainly would have heard Melody’s trademark snoring\n      through the wall—unless Melody was already silent.  \n   •  Therefore Constance must have entered the master bedroom before John got home,\n      stabbed her sleeping sister quickly with the missing ice-pick, wiped the tiny wound\n      (little blood oozes from a single ice-pick thrust to the temple) and returned to her\n      room.  The quiet that followed finally let her fall asleep—something she had not\n      experienced when sharing quarters with Melody since childhood.\n\n   When Vernon points out that everybody else has at least some shred of an alibi, the\n   implication of Constance’s own words hits her; that is why she sighs, “The game is up.”\n\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nVernon Kairns, John Kairns, Nancy Kairns, Constance (--maiden-name-unknown--)\n</SUPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nConstance ( Melody Kairns’s sister )\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly before midnight Constance, unable to face another sleepless night of her sister’s\nthunderous snoring and resentful of the life Melody led with Vernon, left her guest room.\nShe retrieved the ice-pick from the kitchen, slipped into Melody and Vernon’s darkened\nbed-room, and drove the pick once, cleanly, into Melody’s temple.  The wound was small and\nbled little; Melody died almost instantly and therefore made no outcry.  Vernon, already\ndozing, never stirred.  Constance wiped the pick on a hand-towel, kept it, and quietly\nreturned to her room.  For the first time in her life the house was silent; she lay awake\nlong enough to hear John arrive and to recognise the screams and musical stabs of a slasher\nfilm on the downstairs TV.  Satisfied that no one suspected anything, she finally slept\nsoundly.  At nine the following morning Melody’s body was discovered.  Constance went back\nto Texas after the funeral, but on her return visit, when she inadvertently confessed that\nshe had heard “nothing from your room all night long,” she revealed the one thing no one\nelse could have known—that Melody had stopped snoring hours before anyone thought to look\nin on her.  Realising her slip, she acknowledged defeat: “The game is up.”\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Vernon was asleep beside his wife; a stab with an ice-pick is too violent to carry out\n   without awakening him unless he were deeply drugged, and no evidence of drugs is\n   mentioned.  He also freely volunteered for the group interview and pointed the finger at\n   himself as readily as at the others—a strange tactic for the real killer.  \n\n•  John’s presence is accounted for from shortly after midnight until 3 a.m. by the glow\n   and sound of the television, which Constance herself confirms.  To commit the murder he\n   would have had to leave the den, creep upstairs past Constance’s room, murder his\n   mother, clean up, and return—all without missing a significant portion of the film that\n   Constance was hearing or leaving any trace on the den furniture or remote control.  No\n   such gap is reported.  \n\n•  Nancy was on the telephone until 2:30 a.m.; the telephone company and her friend Beth\n   Jameson can verify the call.  Moreover, the call took place in her upstairs bedroom; to\n   exit, reach the master bedroom, kill, and come back without Beth noticing a break in the\n   conversation would be impossible.  \n\n•  Only Constance had both motive and the unaccounted-for time; only she would have known\n   that the normal thunderous snoring had fallen silent long before the body was found,\n   and only she betrayed that knowledge by telling the family she “didn’t hear anything\n   from your room all night.”  Therefore the others are innocent.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

    "reveal_text": "The murderer sat, surprised and shocked, in the big easy chair. The family sat motionless, hanging on the Constance’s every word.\nShe continued, “I have been so depressed since the killing that I have not been able to think straight. But, after listening to everyone this morning, the blinders lifted.”\n“Melody died around two that terrible night; I should say, early morning.” Turning to John, she said, “You could not have killed your mother. Everyone here is aware that I hear better than most people, and I know you were watching television downstairs until a few minutes after three. You could not have been downstairs watching television and upstairs committing murder at the same time.”\nNancy was agitated and near tears, so Constance addressed her next. “It wasn’t you either, sweetheart. It will be easy enough for your friend Beth, and the telephone company, if need be, to verify you were talking on the telephone. I’m certain you would not have heard or paid any attention to unfamiliar noises when deep into conversation with Beth.” The speaker offered a warm, comforting smile and this settled Nancy back into a stony, but calm, silence.\nConstance turned and addressed Vernon. “Remember I said I do not have to account for my time because it doesn’t make any difference?” Vernon, in shock, barely nodded, but he understood what was being said. Constance continued, “That I was in my room alone all night with nobody to confirm it doesn’t make any difference because I know you killed Melody.” Pausing, she said, “I should say; you and the children are well aware of my fear of guns and knives.” Her voice began to break but she continued, “Do you really think I would kill my sister with an ice pick?” Staring intensely at him she went on, “You forgot that we grew up and slept in the same bedroom. Melody never had a sound night’s sleep in her life and makes more noise than a freight train.”\nVernon replied, weakly, “So what?”\nConstance could not bear to look at him any longer. “Do you really expect me to believe that you were alert enough to hear your son come in downstairs, in a house that does not carry sounds well, but you noticed nothing unusual with the restless sleeper lying right beside you all night long?”",

It fell to Vernon, Melody’s husband of twenty-four years, to return to the bedroom and check on his wife. He found Melody, a handsome woman of forty-four years, dead and mostly unmarked.

Constance had little use for Vernon, whom she suspected of womanizing and felt didn’t apply himself to his career and family as he should, but she appreciated the chance to see her niece and nephew again, her last connections to her sister. She and Melody had been close when they were children, even with a seven-year age difference. They had shared a bedroom in their family’s small, east Texas farmhouse when growing up, and also shared all of their hopes, dreams and secrets. Constance recalled those days with fondness but did not entirely miss them, for Melody suffered lifelong sinus trouble and snored loudly, making sound sleep impossible for her until the day she was murdered.

But, the police were stumped by the case, and it was apparent that they would get nowhere in the investigation unless one of the family remembered a detail about the night they’d previously forgotten. Vernon explained that the police had encouraged him to bring them together to talk about Melody’s murder again, with Constance present this time. He was not really confident any of them would remember something previously overlooked, but wanted to give it a try. He then asked, “Did anyone see or hear anything out of the ordinary the night she died?” The Kairns house was a big two story and well insulated. Sound did not carry well in it and Vernon was not surprised when nobody replied in the affirmative. John said, “I came home around midnight; I had been out with friends. All the lights were out and I assumed everyone was in bed. I went to the den and watched TV. It must have been three or so before I went upstairs to bed.” Nancy offered, “I was on the phone in my room, with the door closed. Beth and I didn’t quit talking until two-thirty or so.” Nancy gave her father a guilty look, as she knew he disapproved of her late night calls with her talkative best friend Beth Jameson. Vernon then turned to Constance. Barely hiding his animosity, he asked, “And what about you?” Constance smiled thinly, and answered, “I went to bed before midnight and didn’t see or talk to anyone again until next morning. She paused, and then said to John, “I thought about coming downstairs to watch television with you, but I could tell that you were watching one of those Friday the 13th-type movies. You all know how I hate violence with guns and knives.” Turning to Vernon, she said, “I didn’t hear anything from your room all night long.” Constance and Vernon looked at each other. Icily, she asked, “So what about you?” Vernon replied, “I went to bed at eleven-thirty. I vaguely recall hearing John come in downstairs as I was drifting off to a deep sleep. That’s the last thing I remember before awaking the next morning.” He shook, and his voice cracked when saying, “I didn’t notice anything wrong when I got up. I’m always groggy before morning coffee.” Nancy asked her father, “You don’t really believe John or I killed Mom, do you? She nervously glanced at Constance and said, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you killed Mom.” Nancy’s cheeks were rosy red from embarrassment. Constance answered, softly, “Don’t worry about it, dear. I know what you are going through.” Vernon appreciated his sister-in-law’s gentling handling of his troubled daughter, but that did not stop him from saying, “You are the only one who cannot account for your presence during the window of time Melody … left us.” He could not bring himself to use the word “murder” again. Constance thought a long moment, sadness washing over her as she looked at Vernon and Melody’s sweet children. Before speaking, she silently cursed, “Oh, how I hate it’s come to this!” But then she spoke, saying to all of them, “No, I cannot account for my time. I don’t have to because it doesn’t make any difference. The game is up.”",

      "answer": "(d) Vernon",
      "outcome": "The murderer sat, surprised and shocked, in the big easy chair. The family sat motionless, hanging on the Constance’s every word.\nShe continued, “I have been so depressed since the killing that I have not been able to think straight. But, after listening to everyone this morning, the blinders lifted.”\n“Melody died around two that terrible night; I should say, early morning.” Turning to John, she said, “You could not have killed your mother. Everyone here is aware that I hear better than most people, and I know you were watching television downstairs until a few minutes after three. You could not have been downstairs watching television and upstairs committing murder at the same time.”\nNancy was agitated and near tears, so Constance addressed her next. “It wasn’t you either, sweetheart. It will be easy enough for your friend Beth, and the telephone company, if need be, to verify you were talking on the telephone. I’m certain you would not have heard or paid any attention to unfamiliar noises when deep into conversation with Beth.” The speaker offered a warm, comforting smile and this settled Nancy back into a stony, but calm, silence.\nConstance turned and addressed Vernon. “Remember I said I do not have to account for my time because it doesn’t make any difference?” Vernon, in shock, barely nodded, but he understood what was being said. Constance continued, “That I was in my room alone all night with nobody to confirm it doesn’t make any difference because I know you killed Melody.” Pausing, she said, “I should say; you and the children are well aware of my fear of guns and knives.” Her voice began to break but she continued, “Do you really think I would kill my sister with an ice pick?” Staring intensely at him she went on, “You forgot that we grew up and slept in the same bedroom. Melody never had a sound night’s sleep in her life and makes more noise than a freight train.”\nVernon replied, weakly, “So what?”\nConstance could not bear to look at him any longer. “Do you really expect me to believe that you were alert enough to hear your son come in downstairs, in a house that does not carry sounds well, but you noticed nothing unusual with the restless sleeper lying right beside you all night long?”"
