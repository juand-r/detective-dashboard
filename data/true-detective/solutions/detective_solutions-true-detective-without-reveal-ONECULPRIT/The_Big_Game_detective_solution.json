    "full_text": "At least this time, the commute was worthwhile. For the past few months, I had been spending most of my time in Los Angeles to consult on a new TV show based on a Baltimore Detective. Being the premier Baltimore Detective, at least in my humble opinion, I was hoping that they would call the show “Uncle Buck” after me, but so far no luck. Still, they had chosen me for the honor of being the technical consultant. That had meant constant flights back and forth between Baltimore and LA. This week though, the return flight was worthwhile. This week my beloved Cleveland Browns were going to be playing the Baltimore Ravens. For years since returning to the NFL, the Browns had struggled against all teams. This year was different though as suddenly the Browns were playing well. But in the NFL, when the calendar turns to November, the real football begins. That is crunch time when the winners keep winning and the others start to prepare for next year. For the first time in a long time, on this first weekend in November, the Browns were playing meaningful games. Best of all, I had 50 yard line tickets. I could not wait to get back to Baltimore. As always, I was taking the redeye, leaving LA late Saturday night and arriving in Baltimore Sunday morning. Since most people never sleep much on these flights, everyone arrives with red eyes, thus the name. I however am different. I buckle my seat belt and fall asleep. Taking the plane like this saves me a day of travel time. I just hoped that wearing my Browns jersey on the plane was not going to cause the person next to me to want to chat all night. We boarded the plane and I was relieved to see that the seat next to me was empty. I sat down, buckled my seatbelt and was fast asleep. The next thing I know, I am jolted awake as the plane lands in Baltimore. Just to make sure that no one could have remained asleep through the landing, the flight attendant announced in her ever cheerful voice, “Welcome to Baltimore where the local time is 7:35 am. Please remain in your seats as we taxi to the gate.” That did it, I was officially awake and in need of some coffee. As we taxied to the gate, I turned on my phone to check for messages. I was just setting my watch ahead two hours when my phone rang telling me I had a message marked urgent. The number was my buddy Mike, the director of security for the Ravens and the guy who got me the great seats for today’s game. Worried that he was going to tell me he could not get the tickets after all, I immediately called him back. “Buck”, he said, “we have a major problem and I need your help.” I was relieved, as it did not sound like I was going to lose my tickets, so I asked, “What seems to be the problem?” “Someone stole the film of the Ravens’ last practice. It is the walk through in which they verify all the new plays, defenses, etc. for today’s game. Everyone is convinced the Browns did it. We need to find out what happened and fast.” I told him that I would meet him at the team office in 20 minutes. Mike met me at the front door. After giving me a funny look for showing up at the Raven’s office in a Browns jersey, he quickly explained to me what happened. One of the assistant coaches went into the film room at 6:45 am to take one last look at the film and found that the film was gone. Mike was really upset that something like this could have happened. I told him to calm down and take me through what he knew. The film room is at the end of a hallway. That hallway and two other hallways are covered by a 24-hour video camera. There are three security shifts, with each guard working an 8-hour shift. At the beginning of each shift, they put in a new blank 8-hour tape and it records the three monitors simultaneously. When their shift is over, the new guard takes the old tape out, puts in a new tape and stores the previous tape in order. Each monitor has a date/time stamp on it. The date and time come in off of the Internet, so there is no way that anyone can alter the time shown on the tape. The only person who has access to the video recorder is the security guard who is on duty; last night, that was Tom Barrett. Mike said that they had watched the entire tape. Right at the beginning of the tape Chuck Jarrett, an assistant coach, was seen coming out of the film room. A little after midnight, Carli Antor, one of our interns, left the film room. No one else was in there until 6:45 in the morning when the film was found missing. I suggested that we get everyone together and figure out what happened. Since Tom had stayed since the end of his shift, we started with him. I asked if anything unusual had happened that night. He told me no. As always he made his rounds and was relieved at the end of his shift. The only people he had seen were the two assistant coaches and the intern. I asked if any of them might have taken the film. He said that he had no idea. Next we brought in Carli. She was looking a little nervous but still looked very nice for that early in the morning. I asked her what she was doing in the film room at midnight. “I was watching the film of the last practice to ensure that each player is doing what he is supposed to do with each new play. I have a checklist of each player and their assignments. I review all the new plays to make sure no last minute adjustments need to be made.” With that, she showed me the checklist on her clipboard. Just then, the day security guard walked by on his rounds, so I asked if we could talk with him. Mike introduced me to Rich Pender. Rich said that there was not much that he could say because the film was missing before he showed up for work at 7 am. Since Chuck had not yet gotten in, I asked to take a look at the security tape myself. As Mike had said, Chuck left soon after the tape started. I fast-forwarded through empty tape until I saw Carli leave the film room at 12:43. I noticed that she had on a very tight fitting outfit and was carrying nothing but her clipboard. I fast-forwarded to the end of the tape. As I expected, the digital timer in the corner clicked off the time in order until 7:00 am when the tape ended. Mike looked at me hopefully and asked if I needed to talk to the last two suspects. I told him that first I wanted to watch the tape again, so I rewound from 7 am back till Carli showed up at 12:43 am. I stopped the tape and was looking at Carli when Mike stuck his head in the room and said, “Two hours till game time. Let’s solve this later.” I told him no need to wait, I knew who did it.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  The only way to get the film out of the room without being seen on the corridor cameras is to make sure that the camera isn’t recording while you do it.  \n2.  The recorder uses one 8-hour cassette for every shift.  Tom Barrett started his shift at 11 p.m. and it ended at 7 a.m.  \n3.  The night in question is the first Sunday in November – the night the clocks are turned back one-hour from Daylight-Saving Time (EDT) to Standard Time (EST).  \n   •  In real (absolute) time there are 9 hours between 11 p.m. (EDT) and 7 a.m. (EST).  \n   •  An 8-hour videotape that was put in the machine at 11 p.m. could not possibly reach 7 a.m.; it would run out at 6 a.m.  \n4.  Yet the tape that everyone is watching ends at 7:00 a.m., and its very first frames already show 12:0X a.m. – the hour of 11 p.m. to midnight is completely missing.  \n5.  Therefore the tape was NOT put into the recorder at 11 p.m.; it was put in one hour later, a little after midnight.  \n6.  Only the guard on duty has access to the recorder; that guard was Tom Barrett.  \n7.  Tom simply left the recorder empty for the first hour of his shift, walked down the hall, stole the practice film, hid it, came back and then slipped the blank cassette into the machine at about 12 o’clock.  From that moment on the camera recorded normally, which is why everyone sees:  \n        •  Chuck Jarrett leaving soon after midnight,  \n        •  Carli Antor walking out at 12:43 a.m.,  \n        •  an otherwise empty hall until the film is reported missing.  \n8.  Carli’s tight-fitting outfit and single clipboard could not have concealed a bulky practice tape, and Chuck was seen leaving before the recorder ever started – there is no evidence he was carrying anything.  \n9.  The missing “11 p.m. to midnight” hour on the security recording is the one and only window in which the theft could be carried out, and Tom Barrett is the only person who could have created that window.  Hence he is the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTom Barrett, Chuck Jarrett, Carli Antor, Rich Pender\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTom Barrett\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  11:00 p.m. – Tom Barrett starts the night-watch shift.  Instead of loading the fresh 8-hour cassette into the recorder he puts it on his desk, leaving the cameras unplugged from any tape.  \n•  11:15 p.m.–11:45 p.m. – With no recording being made, Tom walks down the corridor, unlocks the film room, removes the practice film and hides it outside the secured area (car, locker, dumpster – anywhere he can pick it up later).  \n•  12:05 a.m. – Returning to the security office, he finally slides the blank cassette into the machine.  From that moment the cameras begin to record, now showing the correct Internet time stamp.  \n•  12:0X a.m. – The very first images on the tape show assistant coach Chuck Jarrett coming out of the film room; he has no idea the recorder has just been switched on.  \n•  12:43 a.m. – Intern Carli Antor finishes her check-list work and leaves the film room carrying only her clipboard.  \n•  1:00 a.m. – Daylight-Saving Time ends; the time stamp jumps back one hour but the tape continues, eventually filling up its 8 hours of real time and stopping at 7:00 a.m. EST.  \n•  6:45 a.m. – A coach discovers the practice film is gone.  \n•  7:00 a.m. – The tape runs out exactly as though it had recorded for a full “shift.”  Because of the missing first hour, no one is seen taking the film on the portions that were actually recorded.  \nTom remains on duty, pretending astonishment when the theft is reported.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Chuck Jarrett – Although he is seen leaving the film room, this occurs just after the recorder was started; there is no footage showing him carrying anything and no opportunity after that for him to re-enter unseen.  \n•  Carli Antor – She leaves at 12:43 a.m. wearing a skin-tight outfit and holding only a thin clipboard; she simply could not conceal a football-practice film cassette or reel.  Moreover, the film was still there when she did her checklist work.  \n•  Rich Pender – He does not arrive until 7 a.m., after the film has already been reported missing, so he had no opportunity at all.  \n\nOnly Tom Barrett had the exclusive access to the recorder, the opportunity created by the missing hour on the tape, and a plausible motive (selling or passing the film to the Browns).  Therefore he is the culprit. \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "First it was obvious that neither Chuck nor Rich could have taken the film. Carli watched the film in the film room after Chuck left so he could not have taken it. Rich did not come in until after the film was found missing. Carli could not have taken it. With a tight fitting outfit and nothing in her hands, there was no way she could have carried it out of the room without it being seen.\nTom on the other hand had plenty of time to steal the film with no one watching. After all, it is daylight saving time. The clocks got turned back an hour. All that he had to do was turn the recorder off exactly at 2:00 am for an hour and then turn it back on an hour later. He actually worked a 9-hour shift so he should have run out of tape on an 8 hour tape.\nMike and I approached Tom to ask him why he had taken the tape. It turns out that he was retiring the following week and just wanted a memento to remember his time with the team. There was no way he was going to give the film to the Browns.

Right at the beginning of the tape Chuck Jarrett, an assistant coach, was seen coming out of the film room. A little after midnight, Carli Antor, one of our interns, left the film room. No one else was in there until 6:45 in the morning when the film was found missing. I suggested that we get everyone together and figure out what happened. Since Tom had stayed since the end of his shift, we started with him. I asked if anything unusual had happened that night. He told me no. As always he made his rounds and was relieved at the end of his shift. The only people he had seen were the two assistant coaches and the intern. I asked if any of them might have taken the film. He said that he had no idea. Next we brought in Carli. She was looking a little nervous but still looked very nice for that early in the morning. I asked her what she was doing in the film room at midnight. “I was watching the film of the last practice to ensure that each player is doing what he is supposed to do with each new play. I have a checklist of each player and their assignments. I review all the new plays to make sure no last minute adjustments need to be made.” With that, she showed me the checklist on her clipboard. Just then, the day security guard walked by on his rounds, so I asked if we could talk with him. Mike introduced me to Rich Pender. Rich said that there was not much that he could say because the film was missing before he showed up for work at 7 am. Since Chuck had not yet gotten in, I asked to take a look at the security tape myself. As Mike had said, Chuck left soon after the tape started. I fast-forwarded through empty tape until I saw Carli leave the film room at 12:43. I noticed that she had on a very tight fitting outfit and was carrying nothing but her clipboard. I fast-forwarded to the end of the tape. As I expected, the digital timer in the corner clicked off the time in order until 7:00 am when the tape ended. Mike looked at me hopefully and asked if I needed to talk to the last two suspects. I told him that first I wanted to watch the tape again, so I rewound from 7 am back till Carli showed up at 12:43 am. I stopped the tape and was looking at Carli when Mike stuck his head in the room and said, “Two hours till game time. Let’s solve this later.” I told him no need to wait, I knew who did it.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Carli Antor; (b) Chuck Jarrett; (c) Rich Pender; (d) Tom Barrett",
      "answer": "(d) Tom Barrett",
      "outcome": "First it was obvious that neither Chuck nor Rich could have taken the film. Carli watched the film in the film room after Chuck left so he could not have taken it. Rich did not come in until after the film was found missing. Carli could not have taken it. With a tight fitting outfit and nothing in her hands, there was no way she could have carried it out of the room without it being seen.\nTom on the other hand had plenty of time to steal the film with no one watching. After all, it is daylight saving time. The clocks got turned back an hour. All that he had to do was turn the recorder off exactly at 2:00 am for an hour and then turn it back on an hour later. He actually worked a 9-hour shift so he should have run out of tape on an 8 hour tape.\nMike and I approached Tom to ask him why he had taken the tape. It turns out that he was retiring the following week and just wanted a memento to remember his time with the team. There was no way he was going to give the film to the Browns. It was now time to go watch a great game."
