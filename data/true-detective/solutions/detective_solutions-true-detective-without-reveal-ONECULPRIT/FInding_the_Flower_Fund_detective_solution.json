    "full_text": "When the phone rang Monday morning, it was the last of Nan Holcomb’s worries. “What now?” she said, lifting her head from her desk. And however reluctant, she picked up the receiver. “Nan, it’s security. Can you have your employee return our Windex, paper towels, broom … and whatever else he took? He was down here all day Friday borrowing the kitchen sink!” “Who are we talking about here?” “I don’t know his name. … The guy with the long hair.” “Yup. OK. No problem,” she snorted, and hung up abruptly. She had more important things on her mind. Focusing again on the flower fund (an important thing), Nan picked up the receiver, and called security back, “I’m going to need access to my group’s phone records on Friday. I’ll also need the first floor security tapes.” The flower fund was kept locked away in the boss’s office. The fund in Nan Holcomb’s work group was not small pocket change — it totaled close to $500. And early Monday morning, Nan realized this money had been taken from her desk drawer. Nan thought she had hidden the cash well enough. After all, she always told her employees that it was locked in a small file cabinet, behind her bookcase. Nan was not happy to announce that the flower fund was missing. This unfortunate discovery ruined her good mood (she had been delighted with her new office, covered in light shades of white and beige. It was much brighter than her old office on floor three.) But what displeased Nan most was the realization that all of her employees were cunning and clever. Finding the flower fund would prove to be difficult. When Nan confronted her employees at their Monday meeting, she was uneasy. “As you know, normally, I keep my office locked, but the move last week disrupted us in more ways than one.” Nan’s group had moved from floor three to floor five, as part of a company wide reorganization. Constant chaos had been the order of the day for over two weeks. Sighing uncomfortably, Nan began the difficult part of the meeting, “The money was in its normal place Friday morning and I noticed it missing shortly before this meeting. Nobody knows about the fund except us, and first floor security does not show that any of you entered the building over the weekend. It had to have been taken by one of you while we were moving Friday afternoon. It had to have been after my office was moved … there was a period of time that I was away, and the door was unlocked.” James was the first to speak. “That’s quite an accusation, boss.” “I’ll be delighted if I’m proven wrong,” Nan replied, dryly. “That’s why we are going to spend as much time as we need to talk about this. James, we’ll begin with you. Where were you and what were you doing Friday afternoon?” James, brushing the hair away from his eyes, replied, “I split time between cleaning out my old cubicle and setting up the new one here.” This surprised Nan, as James was normally the messiest person in the office, with books scattered all over his work area. Linda was next with her explanation. “I was on the phone in a borrowed cubicle most of the afternoon with a client. In fact, the only time I wasn’t on the phone was when I went down to the first floor break room for a cold drink.” Nan turned next to Justin Thorn. Justin had done the group a big favor Friday by moving the copy machine out of its small room. As he did so, the bottled ink cartridge leaked and smeared all over his hands and clothes, ruining his pants and shoes. Justin’s explanation was believable enough: He had spent all afternoon cleaning the mess from the broken ink cartridge. Last to speak was Lincoln Smith. The likable Lincoln admitted to Nan that he had helped move her furniture up from floor three, but with help from building maintenance. At no time was he alone in her office. “Besides,” he said, “I checked to see that the desk drawers were locked because I didn’t want them to slide during the transition.” He mentioned the rest of his afternoon was spent working on his computer, taking phone calls and moving his own stuff. He assured Nan that he left an electronic paper trail to document his afternoon. Nan looked over her group. Already she was thinking about replacing the thief, who would shortly be terminated. Nan looked directly at the guilty team member and said, “Would you like to leave quietly or shall I have security usher you out?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  WHO COULD POSSIBLY KNOW WHERE THE MONEY REALLY WAS?\n   – Nan always TOLD the staff the flower-fund was “locked in a small file cabinet behind my book-case.”\n   – Nevertheless the cash was stolen from a DESK DRAWER.\n   – Therefore the thief had either (a) actually seen Nan put the envelope in the drawer, or (b) opened the drawer while the furniture was being moved and discovered it there.  A casual visitor would have wasted time forcing the (empty) file-cabinet first.\n\n2.  WHO HAD A NATURAL, LEGITIMATE REASON TO OPEN THE DESK DRAWERS WHILE THE OFFICE WAS BEING MOVED?\n   – Only one person admits touching the desk at all:  Lincoln Smith.  \n     • He says he “helped move her furniture up from floor three”  \n     • He told Nan he “checked to see that the desk drawers were locked because I didn’t want them to slide during the transition.”\n\n   – Checking whether drawers are locked means he necessarily PULLED on them.  \n     • If they were locked they would not open; if they opened he would see inside.  \n     • That is exactly how he could have spotted the envelope full of cash.\n\n3.  WHY NAN ASKED FOR PHONE RECORDS & TAPES\n   – To verify the alibis, not because she already knew which alibi would fail.  \n   – Lincoln’s “electronic paper trail” claim was volunteered before she even mentioned reviewing it – a classic guilty pre-emptive strike.\n\n4.  RED-HERRING:  THE “LONG-HAIRED GUY” AND CLEANING SUPPLIES\n   – Security’s complaint is almost certainly about Justin (who needed Windex, towels, broom after the copy-ink disaster) or James (also long-haired), but that episode only serves to distract the reader.  Borrowing Windex does not put anyone inside Nan’s office; moving her DESK does.\n\n5.  OPPORTUNITY, MOTIVE, LACK OF REAL ALIBI\n   – Lincoln was physically in Nan’s office while she was absent, exactly when the money vanished.  \n   – He had a perfect motive: almost $500 in cash.  \n   – His “wasn’t alone” defence is weak: maintenance staff come and go; a pocket-and-run theft takes two seconds.\n\n6.  NAN’S REACTION\n   – After hearing Lincoln’s unnecessary drawer-comment she instantly sees what happened and stares directly at him: “Would you like to leave quietly …?”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJames, Linda, Justin Thorn, Lincoln Smith\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLincoln Smith\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFriday afternoon, while the department’s furniture was being taken from the 3rd floor to the 5th, Lincoln Smith helped the maintenance crew move Nan Holcomb’s desk.  Before a heavy piece of furniture is tilted, movers often pull on the drawers to be sure they will not slide out.  When Lincoln tugged on the top drawer he found it unlocked and noticed a bulging envelope containing nearly $500 – the flower fund.\n\nSeizing the brief moment when no one was looking, he slipped the envelope into his pocket, pushed the drawer shut and later told Nan that he had merely “checked to see that the desk drawers were locked.”  Back on the 5th floor he resumed normal work on his computer, confident the theft would be blamed on the general confusion of the move.\n\nOn Monday morning Nan discovered the cash missing.  During the staff meeting Lincoln again tried to inoculate himself by stressing he had “an electronic paper trail,” but his very mention of the drawers told Nan exactly how he had come across the money.  Knowing he alone had both access to the drawers and knowledge that the fund was NOT in the file cabinet, she confronted him and offered the choice of leaving quietly or under escort.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• James  \n  – His only suspicious feature is the long hair that matched security’s vague description.  \n  – Nothing places him inside Nan’s office; cleaning his cubicles does not grant access to her desk.\n\n• Linda  \n  – Phone records and first-floor security video would confirm that she really spent the afternoon on the phone except for one brief break-room visit.  \n  – She was nowhere near Nan’s office while the furniture was in transit.\n\n• Justin Thorn  \n  – The person borrowing Windex and paper towels was almost certainly Justin, who had spilled ink all over his hands, clothes and the floor.  \n  – Covered in black ink, he would hardly risk leaving tell-tale stains in Nan’s pristine new white-beige office, and no evidence places him near the desk drawers.\n\nOnly Lincoln had (1) direct knowledge of, and reason to open, the desk drawers, (2) the opportunity while Nan’s office door stood unlocked, and (3) a story that inadvertently revealed his contact with the very place the cash was hidden.  Therefore Lincoln Smith is the thief.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "The stunned thief asked, “How did you know it was me?”\nNan paused for a moment, and then began, “James spoke first. I admit his story of intense cleaning and organizing made me suspicious, as normally he is anything but clean or organized. But, his old area downstairs is spotless, and plus, his new area is set up and ready to go. It looks like he’s been there for weeks, not just for a day. Also, security saw him downstairs constantly getting cleaning supplies.”\nNan paused and let her team digest what she had said, then continued. “Linda spoke next. Linda, you couldn’t be the thief, either. Telephone records will prove you were on the phone and the security guard will verify your presence in the break room.” Looking over her team, Nan added, “I know this group is smart enough not to lie about such things as telephone usage and security. Everyone here knows that most movements and activities in the company building are closely monitored – especially on the first floor.”\nNan again paused, her voice tightening as she got closer to identifying the thief, “It couldn’t be Justin. He had ink from the broken copy machine all over him, even on his shoes. It would have been impossible for him to not leave an ink smear somewhere, especially on the carpet. Even a small stain would have been noticeable in my new office. Everything is white or beige.”\nTurning to Lincoln, she said, with regret, “It had to be you, Lincoln. I believe you told the truth about building maintenance helping you move my things. I do not doubt that you were never in my office alone. I also have no doubt that you can verify all of your other afternoon activities.”\nLincoln interrupted her, “If you believe me, why do you think I stole the money?”\nSoftly, Nan replied, “You made a point to mention that the desk drawers were locked. I don’t know how you knew where to find the fund money but obviously you slipped it into your pocket when the maintenance man was not looking.”\nLincoln said, “I still don’t understand.”\n“Lincoln, I’ve always said the money was locked in the file cabinet. I never wanted anyone to know that it was actually in my desk.”",
