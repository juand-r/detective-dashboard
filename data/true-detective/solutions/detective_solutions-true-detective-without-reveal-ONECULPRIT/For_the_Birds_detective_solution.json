    "full_text": "Hal Feders loved birds: all kinds of birds. He loved watching them, listening to them, feeding them, and, on occasion, eating them and their byproducts. He kept chickens, geese and peacocks on his rural property, and he’d just recently excavated and then watered a large duck pond in back of his house. He hoped to attract a wide range of wild waterfowl with his pond and even had in mind stocking it with a couple of swans. So, he was more than a little excited when he woke up one morning to find a pair of green-headed mallards floating in his brand-new paddling sanctuary. He rushed down to the edge of the pond to welcome his first billed guests. But they quickly duck-paddled away from him, over to the other side of the pond. “Skittish, huh?” Hal said. “Well, I’ll soon fix that.” He ran back to his small barn to get the fifty-pound sack of birdseed he’d purchased in town the previous day. But when he threw the barn door open and looked in the corner where he’d dumped the bag of mixed seeds, he found it gone. Hal searched the entire barn, his chicken coop and the area around both. There was no sack of birdseed. “Am I cuckoo,” he mused, scratching his beak, “or did someone steal my seed?” He could not detect any footprints inside or around his barn, other than the ones he’d made in his search for the missing sack. And the short, gravel driveway that led from his home to the dirt road out front seemed to be devoid of any tire tracks, except for the ones he’d laid down with his pick-up truck the previous afternoon. It was an awful heavy sack of seed for one man or woman to carry too far on foot, so Hal’s suspicions immediately fell on his four neighbors who lived in relatively close proximity to his place. He started off on his quest to find the dirty bird who’d filched his seed, flying across the road and up the driveway of his nearest neighbor, Tor Hansen. “Hey, Tor, have you seen my bag of birdseed!?” he yelled into the screened front door of Tor’s house. The man’s huge body loomed into view behind the wire mesh. “You dumb cluck! Why would I want birdseed? I’ve got forty acres of sunflowers growing out back. The last thing I need is a flock birds. And I don’t appreciate a quack like you bringing them into the neighborhood.” Hal regarded the man’s angry, bearded face. Tor had never been a friendly giant neighbor. “Well … you’ve got a canary, don’t you? I can hear it singing right now.” “Tweeter? He isn’t going to eat a fifty-pound sack of birdseed in a month of Sundays.” “Aha!” Hal crowed. “How’d you know it was a ‘fifty-pound’ sack of birdseed that was missing?” Tor snorted. “I saw you draggin’ it into your barn from my front window yesterday. I’ve got eagle eyes, see.” And with that, the man slammed the inner door in Hal’s face. Hal trudged up the road to the neighbor adjoining the west side of his property, Billy Mumms. As he walked across the man’s green, trimmed front yard, he glanced up at the two large birdhouses sitting atop twenty-foot poles on either side of the lawn. “Hal,” Billy said, bobbing his head in greeting. The angular man with the hawk nose was just coming out of the front door of his house as Hal arrived, a watering can, not a sack of birdseed, in his hand. “Somebody waddled off with a bag of birdseed I just bought,” Hal explained. “Have you seen anyone carrying something like that around, Billy?” The man gave a quick shake of his bony head, eyes darting left and right as he watered the roses that decorated the front of his house. “Hey, Sylvester, get out of there!” he chirped at his cat, hiding amongst the rose bushes. Hal looked up at the birdhouses again. There were four or five purple martins fluttering around the towering feather-nesters. “Say, what’d you feed all those purple martins, Billy?” he casually asked. “There sure are a lot of them.” Billy cocked his head. “Nothing; they eat mosquitoes and other flying insects.” Hal whacked a bloodsucker that had just landed on his arm. “I guess they don’t get all of them,” he said. “Nope. Not all.” Hal walked back down the road, past his and Tor’s property, to Cheryl Judson’s place. The sixty year-old widow lived by herself in a small bungalow just east of Hal’s modest spread. He found her in her backyard, chopping wood. “What’s up, Hal?” Cheryl asked, wiping the sweat from her brow with one hand, clutching her twin-bladed axe with the other. The razor-sharp blades glinted in the sun.\n \nHal glanced from the axe to the creek that ran in back of Cheryl’s house. There was a mama duck and seven fuzzy baby ducks floating close to the far bank of the creek. “Uh, you haven’t seen a fifty-pound bag of birdseed around, have you, Cheryl? I’m missing one.” The woman spat on the ground and ran her finger along one of the blades of the axe. “I don’t have a need for your birdseed, if that’s what you’re squawking about, Hal. I don’t encourage birds or waterfowl – their chirping and quacking keeps me up nights.” “No! No,” Hal squeaked. “I’m not accusing anyone.” He skirted around the woman, closer to the babbling brook, interested in getting a better look at the ducklings. “I’m just, you know … asking around.” Cheryl grunted and placed another piece of firewood on the chopping block. She swung the axe down with a heavy thunk, cleaving the wood clean in two. As Hal watched, the mama duck and her brood swam across the creek towards him, quacking eagerly. “Guess you’ll be going,” Cheryl said, shouldering her axe. “Guess so,” Hal agreed. He waved at the ducks and scooted past Cheryl and across the road. Stan Mifflin lived directly across from Cheryl. The eccentric forty something year old owned a huge, ramshackle house and two equally ramshackle greenhouses. He grew and sold exotic plants, when he wasn’t working on some other project. Today, Hal could see, the chunky man was working on constructing what looked like another greenhouse in the field behind his home. “More space for your Venus flytraps and pitcher plants, Stan?” Hal asked. Stan dropped his saw and shook Hal’s hand, always eager to explain his latest project to any passerby. “No, sir. I’m building an aviary. What do you think of that?” “Really?” Hal responded, with actual interest. “Yes, sir. I’ve already got two scarlet macaws, and I’m going to start breeding them. Here, I’ll show you.” Stan led Hal inside his house and introduced him to two large, colorful birds perched in his kitchen. “Aren’t they beautiful?” he raved. “They are,” Hal agreed, admiring the birds’ bright red, blue and yellow plumage. “And they’re just the start. I’m going to raise all kinds of exotic parrots and cockatoos and such.” “Really? I guess you’re going to need a lot of birdseed, then – to feed them all?” Hal slyly asked. “Awk! Nuts and fresh fruit only, please!” the larger of the two birds cawed in reply, shocking Hal. “They’re pretty picky about their diet,” Stan cackled. “Uh-huh,” Hal said as he and the bird exchanged beady-eyed stares. “Awk! Don’t be a stranger!” it cawed, as Hal exited the house. On the walk back to his own home, Hal thought about all he’d seen and heard during his inquiries.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What made Hal sure the thief had lied?  \n    •  He had combed the floor of his barn and the ground around it and saw no strange footprints.  \n    •  The driveway showed no fresh tyre marks.  \n    →  Whoever removed a 50-lb sack could not have walked across the yard or driven up the drive without leaving some trace, so the only logical way in or out of the property was by water – the little creek that runs past the eastern edge of Hal’s place.  \n2.  Which neighbour can reach the barn by water and is strong enough to man-handle a 50-lb sack?  \n    •  Cheryl Judson’s back-yard actually fronts the same creek.  She was out there splitting logs with a twin-bladed axe, plainly strong enough to handle the load.  \n3.  Did Cheryl have any reason to want birdseed?  \n    •  She denied encouraging birds, yet a mother duck and seven ducklings were swimming right behind her house.  Even more telling, as soon as Hal went near the water the ducks hurried toward him, quacking expectantly – the behaviour of birds that have already been receiving hand-outs.  \n    •  Wild ducklings will happily eat commercial “mixed” birdseed.  Cheryl therefore had both use for and recent possession of exactly what Hal was missing.  \n4.  What was the lie Hal suddenly spotted?  \n    •  Cheryl said, “I don’t encourage birds or water-fowl – their chirping and quacking keeps me up nights.”  \n    •  The scene behind her contradicted every word of that sentence.  A brood of ducklings is not hatched overnight: they had been there for weeks, obviously thriving on regular feed.  Cheryl was the only one whose own back-yard proved her statement false.  \n5.  Motive, opportunity, means:  \n    •  Motive – free food for the duck family she has been secretly enjoying.  \n    •  Opportunity – the creek gives her a private water “road” straight to the rear of Hal’s barn; no footprints or tyre tracks required.  \n    •  Means – she is physically capable (chopping wood with ease) and owns an axe to break the sack open once it reached her place.  \n    Therefore Cheryl is the obvious culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTor Hansen, Billy Mumms, Cheryl Judson, Stan Mifflin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCheryl Judson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nA few nights after Hal brought the 50-lb sack of mixed birdseed home, Cheryl Judson rowed or waded across the creek that links the back of her property with the rear of Hal’s.  She slipped into the barn from the creek side, shouldered (or slid) the heavy sack into her small boat and ferried it back across the water.  The entire trip left no footprints in the barnyard and no tyre marks on the gravel drive, exactly matching the scene Hal later examined.\n\nBack home, Cheryl split the sack open with her wood-axe and began scooping out feed for the duck family that had taken up residence on her stretch of creek.  When Hal came questioning neighbours the next morning she denied “encouraging birds”, but the well-fed mother duck and seven healthy ducklings paddling happily behind her house betrayed the lie.  Realising that Cheryl’s statement could not be true, Hal knew at once that she—alone of all the neighbours—had both motive and an untraceable route to steal the seed. \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Tor Hansen – He genuinely dislikes birds because they threaten his forty acres of sunflowers.  His canary could never consume 50 lb of seed, and his knowledge of the sack’s weight is easily explained: he watched Hal drag it from his window the previous afternoon.  Nothing Tor said was demonstrably false.  \n\n•  Billy Mumms – The only birds he keeps are insect-eating purple martins, which do not eat seed at all.  His story matches known Martin behaviour, and Hal saw no sign of a large sack anywhere on Billy’s tidy lawn.  Billy also has no ready way to move a 50-lb load without leaving tracks across the adjoining field.  \n\n•  Stan Mifflin – Stan’s macaws do in fact live mainly on nuts and fruit; commercial parrot mixes are nut-based, not the cheap mixed grain Hal purchased.  Stan is building a conspicuous aviary and has no reason to hide a sack of seed.  To get to Hal’s barn he would have had to cross the gravel drive or road, leaving clear tyre or foot tracks, of which there were none.  \n\nOnly Cheryl’s words were flatly contradicted by the physical evidence, and only Cheryl had a silent, track-free route to the barn—down the creek that ran behind both properties—plus a clear use for fifty pounds of mixed birdseed.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

That meant they were used to being fed by humans, like Cheryl.\nNormally, any wild bird or animal will instinctively retreat when a human approaches, as the ducks in Hal’s pond did. But their behavior will change if they come to see humans as a source of food. Like a duck to water, so, too, will quackers enthusiastically take to human-offered birdseed.",

There was no sack of birdseed. “Am I cuckoo,” he mused, scratching his beak, “or did someone steal my seed?” He could not detect any footprints inside or around his barn, other than the ones he’d made in his search for the missing sack. And the short, gravel driveway that led from his home to the dirt road out front seemed to be devoid of any tire tracks, except for the ones he’d laid down with his pick-up truck the previous afternoon. It was an awful heavy sack of seed for one man or woman to carry too far on foot, so Hal’s suspicions immediately fell on his four neighbors who lived in relatively close proximity to his place. He started off on his quest to find the dirty bird who’d filched his seed, flying across the road and up the driveway of his nearest neighbor, Tor Hansen. “Hey, Tor, have you seen my bag of birdseed!?” he yelled into the screened front door of Tor’s house. The man’s huge body loomed into view behind the wire mesh. “You dumb cluck! Why would I want birdseed? I’ve got forty acres of sunflowers growing out back. The last thing I need is a flock birds. And I don’t appreciate a quack like you bringing them into the neighborhood.” Hal regarded the man’s angry, bearded face. Tor had never been a friendly giant neighbor. “Well … you’ve got a canary, don’t you? I can hear it singing right now.” “Tweeter? He isn’t going to eat a fifty-pound sack of birdseed in a month of Sundays.” “Aha!” Hal crowed. “How’d you know it was a ‘fifty-pound’ sack of birdseed that was missing?” Tor snorted. “I saw you draggin’ it into your barn from my front window yesterday. I’ve got eagle eyes, see.” And with that, the man slammed the inner door in Hal’s face. Hal trudged up the road to the neighbor adjoining the west side of his property, Billy Mumms. As he walked across the man’s green, trimmed front yard, he glanced up at the two large birdhouses sitting atop twenty-foot poles on either side of the lawn. “Hal,” Billy said, bobbing his head in greeting. The angular man with the hawk nose was just coming out of the front door of his house as Hal arrived, a watering can, not a sack of birdseed, in his hand. “Somebody waddled off with a bag of birdseed I just bought,” Hal explained. “Have you seen anyone carrying something like that around, Billy?” The man gave a quick shake of his bony head, eyes darting left and right as he watered the roses that decorated the front of his house. “Hey, Sylvester, get out of there!” he chirped at his cat, hiding amongst the rose bushes. Hal looked up at the birdhouses again. There were four or five purple martins fluttering around the towering feather-nesters. “Say, what’d you feed all those purple martins, Billy?” he casually asked. “There sure are a lot of them.” Billy cocked his head. “Nothing; they eat mosquitoes and other flying insects.” Hal whacked a bloodsucker that had just landed on his arm. “I guess they don’t get all of them,” he said. “Nope. Not all.” Hal walked back down the road, past his and Tor’s property, to Cheryl Judson’s place. The sixty year-old widow lived by herself in a small bungalow just east of Hal’s modest spread. He found her in her backyard, chopping wood. “What’s up, Hal?” Cheryl asked, wiping the sweat from her brow with one hand, clutching her twin-bladed axe with the other. The razor-sharp blades glinted in the sun.\n \nHal glanced from the axe to the creek that ran in back of Cheryl’s house. There was a mama duck and seven fuzzy baby ducks floating close to the far bank of the creek. “Uh, you haven’t seen a fifty-pound bag of birdseed around, have you, Cheryl? I’m missing one.” The woman spat on the ground and ran her finger along one of the blades of the axe. “I don’t have a need for your birdseed, if that’s what you’re squawking about, Hal. I don’t encourage birds or waterfowl – their chirping and quacking keeps me up nights.” “No! No,” Hal squeaked. “I’m not accusing anyone.” He skirted around the woman, closer to the babbling brook, interested in getting a better look at the ducklings. “I’m just, you know … asking around.” Cheryl grunted and placed another piece of firewood on the chopping block. She swung the axe down with a heavy thunk, cleaving the wood clean in two. As Hal watched, the mama duck and her brood swam across the creek towards him, quacking eagerly. “Guess you’ll be going,” Cheryl said, shouldering her axe. “Guess so,” Hal agreed. He waved at the ducks and scooted past Cheryl and across the road. Stan Mifflin lived directly across from Cheryl. The eccentric forty something year old owned a huge, ramshackle house and two equally ramshackle greenhouses. He grew and sold exotic plants, when he wasn’t working on some other project. Today, Hal could see, the chunky man was working on constructing what looked like another greenhouse in the field behind his home. “More space for your Venus flytraps and pitcher plants, Stan?” Hal asked. Stan dropped his saw and shook Hal’s hand, always eager to explain his latest project to any passerby. “No, sir. I’m building an aviary. What do you think of that?” “Really?” Hal responded, with actual interest. “Yes, sir. I’ve already got two scarlet macaws, and I’m going to start breeding them. Here, I’ll show you.” Stan led Hal inside his house and introduced him to two large, colorful birds perched in his kitchen. “Aren’t they beautiful?” he raved. “They are,” Hal agreed, admiring the birds’ bright red, blue and yellow plumage. “And they’re just the start. I’m going to raise all kinds of exotic parrots and cockatoos and such.” “Really? I guess you’re going to need a lot of birdseed, then – to feed them all?” Hal slyly asked. “Awk! Nuts and fresh fruit only, please!” the larger of the two birds cawed in reply, shocking Hal. “They’re pretty picky about their diet,” Stan cackled. “Uh-huh,” Hal said as he and the bird exchanged beady-eyed stares. “Awk! Don’t be a stranger!” it cawed, as Hal exited the house. On the walk back to his own home, Hal thought about all he’d seen and heard during his inquiries. And then, suddenly, he stopped in his tracks and snapped his fingers, realizing that one of his neighbors had lied to him. He tapped the side of his own beak in recognition – knowing now which neighbor had flown the coop with his sack of birdseed.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Billy Mumms; (b) Cheryl Judson; (c) Stan Mifflin; (d) Tor Hansen",
      "answer": "(b) Cheryl Judson",
      "outcome": "Cheryl Judson lied to Hal when she said that she didn’t ‘encourage birds or waterfowl. The ducks’ behavior in the creek in back of her property proves she lied: they’d swum across the water towards Hal when he had approached them, as if expecting to be fed. That meant they were used to being fed by humans, like Cheryl.\nNormally, any wild bird or animal will instinctively retreat when a human approaches, as the ducks in Hal’s pond did. But their behavior will change if they come to see humans as a source of food. Like a duck to water, so, too, will quackers enthusiastically take to human-offered birdseed."
