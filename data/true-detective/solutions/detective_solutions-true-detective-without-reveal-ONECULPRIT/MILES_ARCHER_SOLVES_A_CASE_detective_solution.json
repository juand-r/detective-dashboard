    "full_text": "I get pretty tired of playing second fiddle to Sam Spade in our own detective firm. Sure, the clients come in, when they do, and play up to him. That’s because I’m usually out of the office, trying to drum up business, anyway. You know, hanging around the precinct, listening to what the cops and reporters have to say, that sort of thing. Maybe that’s why I never got to tell my story, the case I was working on when my partner Sam stumbled onto this Maltese Falcon business, and that cast of movie characters: Joel Cairo, Kasper Gutman, Wilmer Cook, and, oh yes, Brigid O’Shaughnessy. Sam had sent me out with never a second glance, chasing this fellow Floyd Thursby, who was after O’Shaughnessy—at least that’s what Brigid had told us. I never made it back, as you probably know, although I have seen the movie, watching it over your shoulder from time to time. But what you didn’t know is that the case I was working on was every bit as interesting as the one Sam Spade is best known for, his Black Bird caper. Also, I’ve got to admit, my wife Iva sounded a little different, after I started this case and called home to let her know I’d be late for supper. Would you believe it, I always thought she had something of a crush on Sam. Well, solving this case would fix that, and bring in some good money as well. I was in our office checking out the latest Police Gazette when Sandra O’Malley called. As usual our secretary, Effie Perrine, monitored the call. O’Malley sounded nervous and upset, so I talked her down a few registers until she could tell me something of her story. She agreed to meet me at the Donovan Hotel bar for a drink and the rest of her story. It sounded like serious money, and Effie gave me the old “thumbs up!” as I grabbed my fedora and left the office. Sandra O’Malley was an old fashioned girl. By that, I mean she was on her second Old Fashioned when I joined her. “You’ve got to help me, Mr. Archer,” she began. “I only went after those stock certificates because Quinton Jesselton, my boss, told me to. They were bearer certificates, meaning anybody who possessed them could cash them, and they were worth thousands of dollars.” So, I gathered, would be the fee for finding them. “Ok. Calm down, Miss O’Malley, and tell me exactly what happened.” She took another sip and tried to get her story right. “Mr. Jesselton has a collecting business. People with debts to collect refer them to him. He collects them, for a large percentage. Nothing too illegal, you understand—the collecting part, I mean. But these are debts that people would not exactly like to be made public in the first place.” I understood perfectly well. They were illegal gambling debts, or possibly from some other shady business. When the debtor didn’t pay up, it was nothing that the Better Business Bureau could help with. “What were you supposed to do, and what went wrong?” “I was supposed to get the stock certificates from Arnold Grossmecker’s office. It was yesterday, a Sunday afternoon, and nobody was there. It was supposed to be an easy job, really. There was just one security man on duty in the lobby, and he wasn’t always behind the desk, if you know what I mean. It wasn’t hard to sneak past his station when he went to the men’s room. The elevator wasn’t key operated, and I got off at the fifth floor. Grossmecker’s office was down the hall, and the place was empty. Our office skeleton key worked perfectly; I was able to get inside quickly. Mr. Jesselton had been to that office once before. He said he always gave those people one chance to do things right, without complications. “Jesselton paid attention as he was shown into the inner office by Grossmecker’s secretary, Brigid Jellicoe, and saw that Grossmecker had taken the key to the drawer from under a small stone statue on his desk. The point, Jesselton had told me, was that Grossmecker wanted to show him the stock certificates, to show that he was good for the debt. All he needed was a little more time for a deal he was working on to pay off big time. But not a dime now, he had said. Mr. Jesselton said he had a good look at the certificates, which seemed genuine. Their face value was one thousand dollars each, and there were a dozen of them, enough to just cover Grossmecker’s debt in full. “But Mr. Jesselton didn’t trust Grossmecker and his big time deal. He sent me to go get the stock certificates to avoid any more stalling. So yesterday, like I said, I went into the office, lifted the stone statue, and unlocked the desk drawer. The certificates were there all right. I looked around the office and found a stack of large manila envelopes, and put the stock certificates inside one of them. So far, so good. Then all blazes broke loose! “The door behind me opened, and a large man entered the room. ‘What are you doing in my office?’ He yelled to a woman who entered with him, ‘Brigid, tie up her hands!’ I wasn’t about to give him any argument, after one look at the Smith & Wesson he was wagging in my direction. I must have dropped the manila envelope I was carrying. It all happened so fast! Then the lights went out. It was late afternoon, daylight fading, but the shades were drawn. It was harder to see than if the lights had never been on. ‘Hands up!’ another voice said, and I was relieved to see that it was my boss, Mr. Jesselton. What he was doing there, I don’t know. But I’ve never been gladder to see anyone in my life! “Anyway, we tore out of that office and jumped into Mr. Jesselton’s waiting car. His driver had kept the motor running. We set some sort of record getting back to the office. Then I handed the manila envelope to Jesselton. His face went sour. ‘Is this some kind of a joke? If so, I don’t see the humor!’ I followed his look, and saw that the large manila envelope I had just handed him was empty! He gave me just a day to cough up the missing certificates. Of course I tried going back to Grossmecker, pleading my case, but he swears up and down that I took ’em, and that Mr. Jesselton must be trying to pull a fast one on me. That’s why I called you, Mr. Archer. You’ve got to find out what happened! Mr. Jesselton is waiting for us at the office.” We went back to Jesselton’s office, and I called Grossmecker from the phone there. I told him that I had been retained to solve the case, and that I’d be arriving at his office shortly with Jesselton and the young Sandra. When we arrived I said, “Show me exactly what happened.” I looked around. “Don’t leave anything out. Say exactly what you said yesterday, when the stock certificates went missing. I want an exact picture of what happened.” I sat in the office and watched the rerun. Sandra came into the office, flipped on the wall light switch, paused, then looked under the stone statue on the desk, and found the desk key. She opened the desk, and found ... nothing. “Don't worry,” I said. “Just take it from there.” I handed her my newspaper. She looked around the office, saw the stack of large manila envelopes on a side table near the entrance, and opened the top envelope, shoveling my newspaper into it. “What are you doing in my office?” yelled Arnold Grossmecker as he charged through the door. He had a coat in one hand and a Smith & Wesson in the other. The woman, Brigid Jellicoe, followed him in. “Brigid, tie up her hands!” Grossmecker yelled. I could see Brigid Jellicoe ducking back into her outer office. She dropped her coat, produced some string from her desk, entered Grossmecker’s office once again, and quickly tied Brigid’s hands behind her back. Nobody went near the large manila envelope,which Sandra had dropped on the floor. Then the light switch was flipped off by someone in the doorway. That same someone crashed into the room, hat and overcoat still on, a revolver in his right hand. “Hands up!” said Quentin Jesselton. He advanced into the room, walked back and forth, and asked Sandra if she was all right. She murmured yes. After a moment, the light switch was flipped back on by Jesselton. He untied Sandra’s hands, and she picked up the manila envelope from the floor. Then she and Jesselton slowly backed out of the room. I felt like a film director shooting a scene. “Was this how it happened? Would anyone change anything?” Everyone agreed that their little play had been accurate. Then I took out my own revolver. “Hand me your weapons,” I said. “And I’ll tell you who stole the stock certificates.” They did, and I did.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Locate the very small window of time in which the certificates could disappear.  \n    • They were in the drawer when Sandra saw them.  \n    • They were supposed to be inside the envelope that Sandra dropped on the floor.  \n    • When the envelope finally reached Jesselton’s hands, it was empty.  \n    Therefore the certificates left the envelope sometime between Sandra’s dropping it and her handing it to Jesselton.  \n\n2. Who could have reached the envelope during that interval?  \n    • Sandra – she was being tied up and had her hands behind her back; she could not touch the envelope.  \n    • Grossmecker – stood in front of Sandra with a gun. He never approached the envelope; after Sandra and Jesselton backed out he was still under fire and could not have examined the envelope.  \n    • Brigid – was busy at her desk getting string, then tying Sandra. The envelope lay on the floor well away from her desk; in the re-enactment her own actions showed she never went near it.  \n    • The only person who deliberately put the room in darkness, moved about freely, and bent over near the envelope was Quentin Jesselton.  \n\n3. Motive.  \n    Bearer stock certificates are cash; whoever holds them can convert them into money.  Jesselton is a bill-collector who takes “a large percentage” for himself.  If he keeps the certificates there is nobody to complain to the police, because Grossmecker’s debt is not the sort you report.  Sandra is a loyal employee who expects only a salary, not the full face value.  Jesselton alone would make a fortune by pocketing the certificates.  \n\n4. Behavioural clues.  \n    • Why did the “rescuer” turn the lights OFF before he entered?  That benefits only a thief who wants to stoop, open an envelope and hide its contents unnoticed.  \n    • During the re-enactment nobody tried to pick up the envelope.  That makes sense only if the one person who already knows it is empty—Jesselton—realises it no longer matters.  \n    • Finally, when Miles Archer asked for all the guns Jesselton handed his over without removing his overcoat.  The coat is exactly where a flat packet of certificates can hide.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSandra O’Malley, Quentin Jesselton, Arnold Grossmecker, Brigid Jellicoe\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nQuentin Jesselton\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nKnowing exactly when Sandra would try to steal the bearer certificates, Jesselton shadowed her.  \n1.  Sandra placed the twelve $1,000 certificates in the first large manila envelope she found.  \n2.  Grossmecker and his secretary burst in; Sandra, startled, dropped the envelope.  \n3.  Jesselton, waiting in the corridor, flipped the office lights OFF, swept into the room in the confusion, stooped, slipped the certificates into the pocket of his overcoat, and let the now-empty envelope fall again.  \n4.  He then switched the lights back ON, played the white-knight rescuer, untied Sandra and hurried her out before anyone could check the envelope.  \n5.  In his car, still wearing the same overcoat, he opened the envelope, professed astonishment that it was empty and threatened Sandra, thus diverting suspicion from himself.  \n6.  A day later, during Archer’s re-enactment, Jesselton still had the certificates folded flat in an inside coat pocket; everybody else obligingly showed they had never been near the envelope.  Archer saw the only logical conclusion and, after disarming the four, named Jesselton as the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSandra O’Malley – Her hands were tied behind her back from the moment she dropped the envelope until Jesselton freed her; she had no opportunity to open it.  Had she stolen the certificates, she would hardly have hired a detective to find them while continuing to face Jesselton’s threats.\n\nArnold Grossmecker – With a gun trained on him and Jesselton’s gun covering the room, he never approached the envelope and in fact allowed the intruders to leave with what he believed were his certificates—something he would not have done if he still needed them.\n\nBrigid Jellicoe – She never left Sandra’s side while tying her hands; the envelope lay several feet away.  Even if she had managed to reach it, she had no pocket or bag in which to hide twelve stiff certificates while wearing only a coat she immediately dropped.\n\nThus only Quentin Jesselton possessed motive, means, and the brief, darkened opportunity to take the bearer certificates and hide them, making him the sole culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "mystery_text": "I get pretty tired of playing second fiddle to Sam Spade in our own detective firm. Sure, the clients come in, when they do, and play up to him. That’s because I’m usually out of the office, trying to drum up business, anyway. You know, hanging around the precinct, listening to what the cops and reporters have to say, that sort of thing. Maybe that’s why I never got to tell my story, the case I was working on when my partner Sam stumbled onto this Maltese Falcon business, and that cast of movie characters: Joel Cairo, Kasper Gutman, Wilmer Cook, and, oh yes, Brigid O’Shaughnessy. Sam had sent me out with never a second glance, chasing this fellow Floyd Thursby, who was after O’Shaughnessy—at least that’s what Brigid had told us. I never made it back, as you probably know, although I have seen the movie, watching it over your shoulder from time to time. But what you didn’t know is that the case I was working on was every bit as interesting as the one Sam Spade is best known for, his Black Bird caper. Also, I’ve got to admit, my wife Iva sounded a little different, after I started this case and called home to let her know I’d be late for supper. Would you believe it, I always thought she had something of a crush on Sam. Well, solving this case would fix that, and bring in some good money as well. I was in our office checking out the latest Police Gazette when Sandra O’Malley called. As usual our secretary, Effie Perrine, monitored the call. O’Malley sounded nervous and upset, so I talked her down a few registers until she could tell me something of her story. She agreed to meet me at the Donovan Hotel bar for a drink and the rest of her story. It sounded like serious money, and Effie gave me the old “thumbs up!” as I grabbed my fedora and left the office. Sandra O’Malley was an old fashioned girl. By that, I mean she was on her second Old Fashioned when I joined her. “You’ve got to help me, Mr. Archer,” she began. “I only went after those stock certificates because Quinton Jesselton, my boss, told me to. They were bearer certificates, meaning anybody who possessed them could cash them, and they were worth thousands of dollars.” So, I gathered, would be the fee for finding them. “Ok. Calm down, Miss O’Malley, and tell me exactly what happened.” She took another sip and tried to get her story right. “Mr. Jesselton has a collecting business. People with debts to collect refer them to him. He collects them, for a large percentage. Nothing too illegal, you understand—the collecting part, I mean. But these are debts that people would not exactly like to be made public in the first place.” I understood perfectly well. They were illegal gambling debts, or possibly from some other shady business. When the debtor didn’t pay up, it was nothing that the Better Business Bureau could help with. “What were you supposed to do, and what went wrong?” “I was supposed to get the stock certificates from Arnold Grossmecker’s office. It was yesterday, a Sunday afternoon, and nobody was there. It was supposed to be an easy job, really. There was just one security man on duty in the lobby, and he wasn’t always behind the desk, if you know what I mean. It wasn’t hard to sneak past his station when he went to the men’s room. The elevator wasn’t key operated, and I got off at the fifth floor. Grossmecker’s office was down the hall, and the place was empty. Our office skeleton key worked perfectly; I was able to get inside quickly. Mr. Jesselton had been to that office once before. He said he always gave those people one chance to do things right, without complications. “Jesselton paid attention as he was shown into the inner office by Grossmecker’s secretary, Brigid Jellicoe, and saw that Grossmecker had taken the key to the drawer from under a small stone statue on his desk. The point, Jesselton had told me, was that Grossmecker wanted to show him the stock certificates, to show that he was good for the debt. All he needed was a little more time for a deal he was working on to pay off big time. But not a dime now, he had said. Mr. Jesselton said he had a good look at the certificates, which seemed genuine. Their face value was one thousand dollars each, and there were a dozen of them, enough to just cover Grossmecker’s debt in full. “But Mr. Jesselton didn’t trust Grossmecker and his big time deal. He sent me to go get the stock certificates to avoid any more stalling. So yesterday, like I said, I went into the office, lifted the stone statue, and unlocked the desk drawer. The certificates were there all right. I looked around the office and found a stack of large manila envelopes, and put the stock certificates inside one of them. So far, so good. Then all blazes broke loose! “The door behind me opened, and a large man entered the room. ‘What are you doing in my office?’ He yelled to a woman who entered with him, ‘Brigid, tie up her hands!’ I wasn’t about to give him any argument, after one look at the Smith & Wesson he was wagging in my direction. I must have dropped the manila envelope I was carrying. It all happened so fast! Then the lights went out. It was late afternoon, daylight fading, but the shades were drawn. It was harder to see than if the lights had never been on. ‘Hands up!’ another voice said, and I was relieved to see that it was my boss, Mr. Jesselton. What he was doing there, I don’t know. But I’ve never been gladder to see anyone in my life! “Anyway, we tore out of that office and jumped into Mr. Jesselton’s waiting car. His driver had kept the motor running. We set some sort of record getting back to the office. Then I handed the manila envelope to Jesselton. His face went sour. ‘Is this some kind of a joke? If so, I don’t see the humor!’ I followed his look, and saw that the large manila envelope I had just handed him was empty! He gave me just a day to cough up the missing certificates. Of course I tried going back to Grossmecker, pleading my case, but he swears up and down that I took ’em, and that Mr. Jesselton must be trying to pull a fast one on me. That’s why I called you, Mr. Archer. You’ve got to find out what happened! Mr. Jesselton is waiting for us at the office.” We went back to Jesselton’s office, and I called Grossmecker from the phone there. I told him that I had been retained to solve the case, and that I’d be arriving at his office shortly with Jesselton and the young Sandra. When we arrived I said, “Show me exactly what happened.” I looked around. “Don’t leave anything out. Say exactly what you said yesterday, when the stock certificates went missing. I want an exact picture of what happened.” I sat in the office and watched the rerun. Sandra came into the office, flipped on the wall light switch, paused, then looked under the stone statue on the desk, and found the desk key. She opened the desk, and found ... nothing. “Don't worry,” I said. “Just take it from there.” I handed her my newspaper. She looked around the office, saw the stack of large manila envelopes on a side table near the entrance, and opened the top envelope, shoveling my newspaper into it. “What are you doing in my office?” yelled Arnold Grossmecker as he charged through the door. He had a coat in one hand and a Smith & Wesson in the other. The woman, Brigid Jellicoe, followed him in. “Brigid, tie up her hands!” Grossmecker yelled. I could see Brigid Jellicoe ducking back into her outer office. She dropped her coat, produced some string from her desk, entered Grossmecker’s office once again, and quickly tied Brigid’s hands behind her back. Nobody went near the large manila envelope,which Sandra had dropped on the floor. Then the light switch was flipped off by someone in the doorway. That same someone crashed into the room, hat and overcoat still on, a revolver in his right hand. “Hands up!” said Quentin Jesselton. He advanced into the room, walked back and forth, and asked Sandra if she was all right. She murmured yes. After a moment, the light switch was flipped back on by Jesselton. He untied Sandra’s hands, and she picked up the manila envelope from the floor. Then she and Jesselton slowly backed out of the room. I felt like a film director shooting a scene. “Was this how it happened? Would anyone change anything?” Everyone agreed that their little play had been accurate. Then I took out my own revolver. “Hand me your weapons,” I said. “And I’ll tell you who stole the stock certificates.” They did, and I did.",
