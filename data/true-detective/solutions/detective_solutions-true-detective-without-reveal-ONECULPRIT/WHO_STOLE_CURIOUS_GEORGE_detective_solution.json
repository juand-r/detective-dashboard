    "full_text": "\"I'm 75 years old,\" shouted Mr. Ferguson, \"and I like Curious George!\" Everyone in the library stared at Mr. Ferguson, and Mrs. Yee, the librarian, glared, like she was trying to will him to talk more quietly. Even Mr. Ferguson's white hair seemed, like it was puffing away from his head in little tufts. But he was arguing with a seven-year-old! Mr. Ferguson had a round face and round eyes, and he looked like an angry pancake as he leaned down to make his point. \"The pictures are still funny!\" Mr. Ferguson insisted. \"And I'm glad when the monkey gets some help from his friend, the man with the yellow hat!\" Seven-year-old Skyler looked at him suspiciously. \"Maybe the books remind me of when I was young,\" Mr. Ferguson added wistfully. \"Back then, I had my whole life ahead of me.\" \"But now you're too old,\" said Skyler, and kicked him in the shins. Mr. Ferguson hated children, but he loved children's books. For 75 years he'd lived in Granville, but he'd never visited the library before. Now he visited every day, always checking out one of the tiny yellow Curious George books with their funny, cartoony illustrations. It was embarrassing when Skyler kicked him, or the librarian gave him a scolding look, but he really enjoyed the books. (And it was cheaper than going to the movies!) Sometimes Mr. Ferguson's eyes lingered over the pictures, and he imagined what it would be like to live on an island far away, like the monkey in the Curious George books. The daydreams were so wonderful, that it sometimes took a long time before he'd turn to the next page. But now Mrs. Yee was stomping over towards the children’s section to scold the two noisy patrons. Skyler took off to hide behind a tall bookshelf, expecting Mr. Ferguson to come and chase him. Despite all of this, Mr. Ferguson still thought most days in Granville to be pretty boring. The library was next to a water silo that said \"Granville\" in bold black letters, and there wasn't much to see on the one road through town. Granville Avenue had just a few stores on either side, plus a narrow building that doubled as the sheriff's office. When the children grew up, they moved away from Granville, and if you stayed, like Mr. Ferguson did, life was pretty quiet. Maybe that's why Mr. Ferguson liked the library so much. But there was one story that Mr. Ferguson had never read. The Granville public library had 34 different books that were all about the life of his favorite funny monkey. There was \"Curious George Goes to a Costume Party\" and even \"Curious George Goes to the Library.\" But now Mr. Ferguson was crouching by a floor-level shelf in the library's small children's section. He pointed his spectacles towards the books' spines so he could read every title for the book he was still looking for. “Curious George and the Pizza” Every day he’d looked through the other 33 books for that title. And every day it was gone. \"Checked out by someone else,\" he muttered, and that only made him want the book more. He never told any of the children which book he wanted and least of all, Skyler. But today, yet again, he'd have to check out a different book instead. Mrs. Yee, the librarian, seemed glad that the children's section had quieted down. Sometimes she wished she could throw out the noisy people and reserve the library for just quiet people. Yes, she'd read a story out loud every Wednesday at 2 p.m. for the children, but even then she talked in a soft, careful voice. Walking sadly to the checkout desk, Mr. Ferguson carried his second choice: \"Curious George at the Ballet.\" He tried not to look at the teenager behind the checkout desk, an intelligent looking youngster wearing glasses named Dexter. As Dexter ran his book over a laser scanner, Mr. Ferguson asked a question that would lead to a complicated mystery. Is it possible that a book could be stolen? \"There's no way!” said Dexter proudly -- pointing to the library's new anti-crime system. \"Our computer's pretty old so it can only track the adult books and the mysteries.\" But then he pointed to two tall rectangular panels, one on either side of the door. They were white and looked ordinary, but there was a fat wire connecting the two panels, and it led to a grey metal box on the wall by the checkout desk. \"Every book in this library has a small radio frequency transmitter.” Dexter said. \"If you tried to walk out the door with a stolen library book…” And then he pulled a book from the stack, and carried it over to one of the panels. The box on the wall made a very loud ringing sound as Mrs. Yee squealed in surprise. Dexter smiled proudly and said, \"It's not possible to steal a book. The alarm bells will always go off unless the book has been checked out.\" Mr. Ferguson said it seemed like a waste of time, which offended Dexter. It seemed like Mr. Ferguson was always offending people. He was sorry that he'd raised his voice today at the 7-year old, although earlier in the week he’d even raised his voice at Dexter! (\"It's never here!\" Mr. Ferguson had shouted. \"I check every single day, but the book that I want is never here!\" It had been early in the morning, and he'd been feeling cranky. He'd walked over a mile to get to the library only to once again be disappointed.) But on that day, shouting didn't seem to help. \"Shh!\" Mrs. Yee said fiercely. \"Maybe I'll feed the book to my dog and then you'll never come back and make noise in my library.\" Dexter smiled like he thought that was a good idea, so Mr. Ferguson just took a deep breath and checked out a different book instead: \"Curious George goes to the Dentist.\" But Dexter seemed happy today, proud to be triggering the loud alarm bells. \"See?\" he said smugly. \"It's just not possible to steal a library book.\" \"Except last Wednesday,” Mrs. Yee said angrily, just so she could disagree with Dexter. “What happened last Wednesday?” Mr. Ferguson asked. \"At 2:00, the box shorted a fuse for 10 minutes.” Dexter grumbled quietly. \"Because Dexter plugged a slide projector into the same circuit!\" teased Mrs. Yee. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The next day, there was a police car parked in front of the library. The sheriff's office was only two blocks away, but Granville's sheriff liked having an excuse to drive the police car around. \"I'm on official business,” he said to the librarian. \"What's that?\" asked Mrs. Yee, suspiciously. The sheriff looked down and mumbled under his breath. \"I need a copy of 'Curious George and the Pizza.'\" \"What?!\" squawked Mrs. Yee. The sheriff's face turned bright red, and he looked really uncomfortable. \"It's not for me,\" he said. \"The governor's family is having lunch in Granville today, and my wife wants to read a story to their kids. The governor is Italian-American, so she wants to read a children's book that's about pizza.\" Mrs. Yee was so excited about the governor that she clapped her hands loudly while Dexter checked the computer's records for the book. \"It says it's here -- it should be in the children's section.\" But the sheriff shook his head. The library had just opened, but he'd already checked in the children's section, and the book wasn't there. Mrs. Yee started to panic, while Dexter just looked hurt. \"Our library's anti-crime system is foolproof!\" \"There he is!\" shouted Mrs. Yee, pointing at Mr. Ferguson. \"He asks for that book every day! Arrest him!\" Mr. Ferguson glared back at Mrs. Yee, and then -- acting like a librarian – he said \"Shh!\" He was feeling even crankier than usual -- it was hot outside. And he didn't even think it was possible to arrest someone over Curious George. \"How come you're so sure I stole it?\" Mr. Ferguson said. \"I'm not the only one who wanted it. Mrs. Yee threatened to feed the book to her dog so I'd stop coming around making noise in your precious library. And when she said it, Dexter laughed! Maybe he stole it, and then hacked into the anti-crime system.\" \"Maybe Skyler stole it,\" Dexter suggested with a smile, \"just to keep Mr. Ferguson from having it.\" \"Does Skyler hate Mr. Ferguson?\" the sheriff asked. \"Well, he kicked him in the shins once,\" Dexter said. \"What are we going to do?\" wailed the sheriff. \"The governor's coming, my wife's counting on me -- and I want my Curious George!\" Can you help the sheriff find the book?",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWhat really happened to “Curious George and the Pizza?”\n\t•\tThe book is not on the children’s shelf and has not shown up for at least a week.  \n\t•\tThe electronic gates will scream unless the tag is switched off by the desk-scanner.  \n\t•\tOnly someone who can reach that scanner without attracting notice can walk out with the book while the gates are working.  That means library staff.\n\n2.\tTime of the disappearance  \n\t•\tMrs Yee reminds Dexter that the alarm system was dead for ten minutes last Wednesday at exactly 2 p.m. – the weekly story-hour.  \n\t•\tBeginning the very next morning Mr Ferguson starts complaining that the book “is never here”.  \n\t•\tSo the book vanished during that ten-minute blackout.\n\n3.\tWho had access, motive, knowledge?  \n\t•\tMr Ferguson – big motive, but he was in the library earlier that morning; the alarm was still working then.  He did not even know the power failure was going to happen.  \n\t•\tSkyler – seven years old and, more importantly, had no idea which title Ferguson wanted.  No motive.  \n\t•\tMrs Yee – could have done it, but it would endanger her job and the weekly story-hour she cherishes.  Her “I’ll feed it to my dog” line is obviously a bluff to quiet Ferguson.  \n\t•\tDexter – had the projector, plugged it in, and personally caused the power failure.  He therefore knew the exact moment the alarm was dead.  He is also the one person who:\n\t\t–\tcontrols the desk scanner that switches off the tags,  \n\t\t–\tknows the computer system well enough to change a record, and  \n\t\t–\tlied outright when Ferguson asked if the computer could track the children’s books (“It only tracks the adult books and the mysteries”).  Later he looks the book up on that very same computer – proving he was lying and trying to keep Ferguson from asking for a search.  \n\t•\tTherefore Dexter is the only person with motive (he obviously wanted the book himself – he’s a bright teenager who likes to read), opportunity (he caused the blackout), and the technical means (desk scanner and access to the database) to make the book vanish without the alarm ever sounding.\n\n4.\tPhysical / documentary evidence\n\t•\tThe electronic record now says the book is “in the library,” which could only happen if a staff member scanned it back in even though it never returned to the shelf.  \n\t•\tThat same staff member also had to lie about the catalogue’s abilities in order to keep patrons from noticing the entry.\n\nConclusion: Dexter had motive, opportunity, means, and told a provable lie, so he is the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Arnold Ferguson, Mrs. Lillian Yee, Dexter (no last name given), Skyler (no last name given), Sheriff (no name given)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDexter\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDexter, the bespectacled teenage library aide, secretly likes the Curious George books just as much as Mr. Ferguson does, and he especially wanted to keep “Curious George and the Pizza.”  Knowing that the security gates are armed, he planned to create a short window in which they would be powerless.  At 2 p.m. every Wednesday Mrs Yee uses a slide projector for story-hour.  Last Wednesday Dexter deliberately plugged that projector into the same circuit that powers the alarm controller, blowing the fuse and shutting the gates down for ten minutes.  While Mrs Yee was occupied reading to the children and most eyes were on the screen, Dexter slipped to the children’s shelves, took “Curious George and the Pizza,” and walked straight out with it; the disabled gates stayed silent.  Back at the desk he scanned the book as “checked in,” thereby re-arming its tag but making the catalogue insist that the book was “on the shelf.”  Then he carried it home.  Later, when Mr. Ferguson complained, Dexter lied that the computer could not track children’s books so that no one would spot the discrepancy.  The next morning the governor’s visit exposed the missing title, and Dexter’s earlier lie plus the forged computer status are what ultimately give him away.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMr. Ferguson – wanted the book but was only a patron; he was in the library while the alarms still worked and had no way to predict or cause the ten-minute blackout.  If he had stolen the book he would not keep drawing attention to its absence.\n\nMrs. Yee – had access, but stealing the book would sabotage her own story-hour and risk her job.  She also had no reason to falsify the computer record.\n\nSkyler – a seven-year-old who never learned which title Ferguson coveted; he lacked both motive and the knowledge of how to disable the alarm or falsify records.\n\nSheriff – first hears of the book the morning it is reported missing; he had neither previous motive nor opportunity.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "mystery_text": "\"I'm 75 years old,\" shouted Mr. Ferguson, \"and I like Curious George!\" Everyone in the library stared at Mr. Ferguson, and Mrs. Yee, the librarian, glared, like she was trying to will him to talk more quietly. Even Mr. Ferguson's white hair seemed, like it was puffing away from his head in little tufts. But he was arguing with a seven-year-old! Mr. Ferguson had a round face and round eyes, and he looked like an angry pancake as he leaned down to make his point. \"The pictures are still funny!\" Mr. Ferguson insisted. \"And I'm glad when the monkey gets some help from his friend, the man with the yellow hat!\" Seven-year-old Skyler looked at him suspiciously. \"Maybe the books remind me of when I was young,\" Mr. Ferguson added wistfully. \"Back then, I had my whole life ahead of me.\" \"But now you're too old,\" said Skyler, and kicked him in the shins. Mr. Ferguson hated children, but he loved children's books. For 75 years he'd lived in Granville, but he'd never visited the library before. Now he visited every day, always checking out one of the tiny yellow Curious George books with their funny, cartoony illustrations. It was embarrassing when Skyler kicked him, or the librarian gave him a scolding look, but he really enjoyed the books. (And it was cheaper than going to the movies!) Sometimes Mr. Ferguson's eyes lingered over the pictures, and he imagined what it would be like to live on an island far away, like the monkey in the Curious George books. The daydreams were so wonderful, that it sometimes took a long time before he'd turn to the next page. But now Mrs. Yee was stomping over towards the children’s section to scold the two noisy patrons. Skyler took off to hide behind a tall bookshelf, expecting Mr. Ferguson to come and chase him. Despite all of this, Mr. Ferguson still thought most days in Granville to be pretty boring. The library was next to a water silo that said \"Granville\" in bold black letters, and there wasn't much to see on the one road through town. Granville Avenue had just a few stores on either side, plus a narrow building that doubled as the sheriff's office. When the children grew up, they moved away from Granville, and if you stayed, like Mr. Ferguson did, life was pretty quiet. Maybe that's why Mr. Ferguson liked the library so much. But there was one story that Mr. Ferguson had never read. The Granville public library had 34 different books that were all about the life of his favorite funny monkey. There was \"Curious George Goes to a Costume Party\" and even \"Curious George Goes to the Library.\" But now Mr. Ferguson was crouching by a floor-level shelf in the library's small children's section. He pointed his spectacles towards the books' spines so he could read every title for the book he was still looking for. “Curious George and the Pizza” Every day he’d looked through the other 33 books for that title. And every day it was gone. \"Checked out by someone else,\" he muttered, and that only made him want the book more. He never told any of the children which book he wanted and least of all, Skyler. But today, yet again, he'd have to check out a different book instead. Mrs. Yee, the librarian, seemed glad that the children's section had quieted down. Sometimes she wished she could throw out the noisy people and reserve the library for just quiet people. Yes, she'd read a story out loud every Wednesday at 2 p.m. for the children, but even then she talked in a soft, careful voice. Walking sadly to the checkout desk, Mr. Ferguson carried his second choice: \"Curious George at the Ballet.\" He tried not to look at the teenager behind the checkout desk, an intelligent looking youngster wearing glasses named Dexter. As Dexter ran his book over a laser scanner, Mr. Ferguson asked a question that would lead to a complicated mystery. Is it possible that a book could be stolen? \"There's no way!” said Dexter proudly -- pointing to the library's new anti-crime system. \"Our computer's pretty old so it can only track the adult books and the mysteries.\" But then he pointed to two tall rectangular panels, one on either side of the door. They were white and looked ordinary, but there was a fat wire connecting the two panels, and it led to a grey metal box on the wall by the checkout desk. \"Every book in this library has a small radio frequency transmitter.” Dexter said. \"If you tried to walk out the door with a stolen library book…” And then he pulled a book from the stack, and carried it over to one of the panels. The box on the wall made a very loud ringing sound as Mrs. Yee squealed in surprise. Dexter smiled proudly and said, \"It's not possible to steal a book. The alarm bells will always go off unless the book has been checked out.\" Mr. Ferguson said it seemed like a waste of time, which offended Dexter. It seemed like Mr. Ferguson was always offending people. He was sorry that he'd raised his voice today at the 7-year old, although earlier in the week he’d even raised his voice at Dexter! (\"It's never here!\" Mr. Ferguson had shouted. \"I check every single day, but the book that I want is never here!\" It had been early in the morning, and he'd been feeling cranky. He'd walked over a mile to get to the library only to once again be disappointed.) But on that day, shouting didn't seem to help. \"Shh!\" Mrs. Yee said fiercely. \"Maybe I'll feed the book to my dog and then you'll never come back and make noise in my library.\" Dexter smiled like he thought that was a good idea, so Mr. Ferguson just took a deep breath and checked out a different book instead: \"Curious George goes to the Dentist.\" But Dexter seemed happy today, proud to be triggering the loud alarm bells. \"See?\" he said smugly. \"It's just not possible to steal a library book.\" \"Except last Wednesday,” Mrs. Yee said angrily, just so she could disagree with Dexter. “What happened last Wednesday?” Mr. Ferguson asked. \"At 2:00, the box shorted a fuse for 10 minutes.” Dexter grumbled quietly. \"Because Dexter plugged a slide projector into the same circuit!\" teased Mrs. Yee. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The next day, there was a police car parked in front of the library. The sheriff's office was only two blocks away, but Granville's sheriff liked having an excuse to drive the police car around. \"I'm on official business,” he said to the librarian. \"What's that?\" asked Mrs. Yee, suspiciously. The sheriff looked down and mumbled under his breath. \"I need a copy of 'Curious George and the Pizza.'\" \"What?!\" squawked Mrs. Yee. The sheriff's face turned bright red, and he looked really uncomfortable. \"It's not for me,\" he said. \"The governor's family is having lunch in Granville today, and my wife wants to read a story to their kids. The governor is Italian-American, so she wants to read a children's book that's about pizza.\" Mrs. Yee was so excited about the governor that she clapped her hands loudly while Dexter checked the computer's records for the book. \"It says it's here -- it should be in the children's section.\" But the sheriff shook his head. The library had just opened, but he'd already checked in the children's section, and the book wasn't there. Mrs. Yee started to panic, while Dexter just looked hurt. \"Our library's anti-crime system is foolproof!\" \"There he is!\" shouted Mrs. Yee, pointing at Mr. Ferguson. \"He asks for that book every day! Arrest him!\" Mr. Ferguson glared back at Mrs. Yee, and then -- acting like a librarian – he said \"Shh!\" He was feeling even crankier than usual -- it was hot outside. And he didn't even think it was possible to arrest someone over Curious George. \"How come you're so sure I stole it?\" Mr. Ferguson said. \"I'm not the only one who wanted it. Mrs. Yee threatened to feed the book to her dog so I'd stop coming around making noise in your precious library. And when she said it, Dexter laughed! Maybe he stole it, and then hacked into the anti-crime system.\" \"Maybe Skyler stole it,\" Dexter suggested with a smile, \"just to keep Mr. Ferguson from having it.\" \"Does Skyler hate Mr. Ferguson?\" the sheriff asked. \"Well, he kicked him in the shins once,\" Dexter said. \"What are we going to do?\" wailed the sheriff. \"The governor's coming, my wife's counting on me -- and I want my Curious George!\" Can you help the sheriff find the book?",
