    "full_text": "65 million years ago, Grog the caveman fell asleep under the sun. He snored, enjoying a long nap. He dreamed he was chasing a dinosaur, and that the dinosaur was afraid of Grog's mighty club. It was the dinosaur that ran, and it was Grog who was triumphant. But then Grog was woken up -- by the roaring of a real dinosaur. And his day was only going to get worse … Grog noticed the sun was gone -- he was now in the 75-foot shadow of an Apatosaurus. The dinosaur eyed Grog curiously, then lowered its head down for a closer look. The dinosaur was always hungry, and its neck was 25 feet long -- almost as long as its tail. As the dinosaur stretched its neck towards Grog, the caveman could see its two shining black eyes drawing closer and closer. Grog grabbed his club, and bashed the dinosaur's head. It roared with pain, pulling its neck back, and then charged angrily towards Grog. He felt the ground shaking as he ran, while the dinosaur's 25-ton body stomped furiously towards him. The enraged beast lowered its head as it moved, and Grog desperately swung his club again. The club missed the dinosaur, but it squealed with rage as it lifted its head away. Grog scrambled for a grove of trees where it was too thick for the dinosaur to follow him. He could hear nothing, save for the sound of his own panting lungs. Behind a rock, Grog dared to peek, but the angry dinosaur had stopped running, and seemed more interested in eating a large cluster of bushes. A monkey laughed in the tree above Grog. But Grog was about to become the first man to ever solve a mystery. Because Grog was tired of being chased. He wanted another nap. And he wanted dinner. Grog scowled at the monkey. He wondered if the monkey would fear his mighty club. Or, if the monkey would chase him, too. The monkey seemed unafraid, and even playful, chattering happily from the highest branch. Grog saw why the monkey was happy -- it was eating! Grog still wanted dinner. He wondered if he could eat a monkey. Or, if he could climb the tree, he could steal the monkey's food. The monkey looked down at Grog suspiciously. It made monkey noises, swinging over to the nearest branch. Soon it would disappear among the trees. Grog tried not to crack the branches on the ground, so the monkey wouldn't know Grog was following him. The monkey was afraid of Grog's club, he thought, and Grog wanted something to be afraid of him today -- even if it was just a monkey. But he was also curious where the monkey was going. Further ahead he could just see the monkey's furry brown body swinging through the trees. Suddenly the trees became shorter, with shady fronds that were dark and green. Sweet smells filled the air, and Grog felt as though he were dreaming again. The monkey had led him to the most wonderful thing he had ever seen: Enough bananas for 100 dinners! Grog smiled, his eyes moist with happiness. He imagined himself eating a banana. And then another. And then another, and another. Maybe he'd make a bed from banana peels, or wear clothes made from banana peels! And when the dinosaur chased him, maybe it would slide on all of the banana peels. And then Grog could beat it with his club. Grog hoped nothing would happen to his bananas. He shimmied up one of the tall, skinny tree trunks and picked a tasty fruit out of a bunch (and then another, and then another). Even the monkey chattered happily, as though having a rowdy mealtime conversation, and playfully tossed the peel from every banana over its shoulder without looking. The bananas glowed in the afternoon sun, but Grog realized that the sun was lowering in the sky. He would return to his family, and remember where he'd left the banana trees. He slid down the tree and swaggered as he walked, strutting with pride over his new discovery -- “100 dinners.” He carried a large bunch of bananas with him, and he dragged his mighty club in the ground behind him (leaving a deep groove in the dirt). Tomorrow when the sun rose, he would follow the line again. But this time, his family would follow him. And Grog would be a hero! Grog peeked cautiously into the field at the edge of the grove and raced to the other side. There was a gently sloping mountain, and Grog knew its trail well. Enormous boulders overwhelmed the dirt and grass, making it too difficult to climb for anyone but the cavemen. Grog could see black smoke rising in the sky up ahead. His family would be warming themselves by the fire, and grumbling about their hunger. Suddenly Grog was tackled to the ground. He angrily kicked and thrashed his arms in frustration, until he heard the other caveman laughing. He turned to see Droo, his younger brother, sitting behind him in the dirt and snickering. Grog threw a banana at Droo. Droo looked confused, as the banana bounced off his shoulder and plopped in the trail. Grog stared with exasperation, then picked up the banana and pulled back its peel. “Mmmm,” said Grog, sniffing the sweet banana. Droo now eyed the banana with hunger and greed. “Mmmm,” Grog said again. And when Droo was good and interested -- Grog threw the banana at him again. Then he ran for their cave. Droo had scooped up the banana before chasing after him, so Grog had a head start. Grog ran as fast as he could to reach the tribe before Droo. He left his club on the trail, and arrived panting and laughing. His family stared in surprise. His father and mother were warming themselves by the fire, just as Grog expected. Grog's mother smiled, and he sensed the tenderness in her kind eyes and long grey hair. And when Grog held up the bunch of bananas, their eyes lit up with joy. There'd be dinner for everyone tonight, and breakfast for tomorrow. Grog shared the news about the banana orchard hidden in the grove. He described its location, and how he'd used his club to leave a trail through the jungle. Grog's father seemed suspicious. It was dangerous to wander beyond the field, where the Apatosaurus lurked. Why had Grog risked his life -- chancing death for the family's precious older son -- to explore in the trees? Grog's mother listened with interest, but said nothing. She was chewing on one of the bananas, happy and quite contented. Droo was jealous. Droo had found no food, and had disappointed his mother and father. And Grog arrived with an enormous bunch of bananas -- which tasted funny to Droo. Droo had never been able to climb a tree, so he had never tasted one of the mushy fruits. He threw the banana peel at Grog, and was even more irritated when Grog ignored him altogether. The family slept peacefully in their cave that night. Grog dreamed happily of delicious bananas and his proud family, though all through the night, he could hear his father snoring. A gray sky woke Droo in the morning, and as he sat up he deliberately nudged Grog with his elbow. When the rest of the family woke, they began walking down the mountain together. Grog led the way -- past the boulders, down the trail, to the edge of the field. The sun was shining, with only the morning sounds of birds chirping happily in the jungle. Even the buzzing insects seemed cheerful today, as Grog spotted the deep groove that he'd made with his club. But there was something wrong. The trail quickly disappeared, as though someone had erased its path through the dirt, and everywhere there were cracked branches (though Grog hadn't disturbed them yesterday on his trip to the grove). Had someone else discovered his bananas in the night while he'd slept? Grog heard the sound of the river, and hurried forward, knowing the banana grove would be nearby. But all of the bananas were gone! Grog stared in disbelief at the empty trees, which just yesterday had been filled with sweet yellow bananas. The trees were there -- but the bananas weren't. There were only leaves and branches on the ground -- but no bananas! No bananas! Was Grog being punished? Did a tribe of monkeys steal the bananas before Grog could get them? Maybe the dinosaur was angry because Grog had bashed his head with a club. Grog looked suspiciously at Droo. Did his jealous brother leave the cave last night? He could have easily followed the trail of the club -- and then hidden the bananas so that Grog couldn't find them. But then Grog had the darkest thought of all. Perhaps the bananas were hidden by his own father. While they slept, maybe his father had come to the grove. Hiding the bananas would keep Grog from crossing the field. It was hard for Grog to see his mother stare sadly at the empty banana trees. Suddenly, Grog realized who stole the bananas.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What happened between evening and next morning?\n   – Someone or something followed the deep groove Grog made with his club, walked through the same patch of jungle, reached the banana grove and removed every last banana.\n\n2. Physical traces found next morning  \n   • The groove had “quickly disappeared, as though someone had erased its path through the dirt.”  \n   • “Everywhere there were cracked branches (though Grog hadn’t disturbed them yesterday).”  \n   • In the grove there were “only leaves and branches on the ground – but no bananas!”\n\n3. What would erase a furrow in the earth and snap branches?  \n   – Enormous weight tramping on the trail, and a huge body pushing through vegetation.\n\n4. Who or what possesses that weight?  \n   – The 25-ton Apatosaurus Grog met earlier that day.  A lumbering dinosaur would both flatten the groove and break branches.\n\n5. What would remove the bananas without leaving a carpet of peels?  \n   – A giant herbivore that gulps foliage whole.  \n   – Monkeys or humans peel bananas and drop the skins (as the monkey did in the story).  No peels were found.  \n   – Therefore neither monkeys nor cavemen removed the fruit.\n\n6. Could the cavemen have done it?  \n   • Father: Proven in the cave – Grog “could hear his father snoring” all night.  \n   • Mother: Slept in the cave; no motive to sabotage her own food.  \n   • Droo: Jealous, but “had never been able to climb a tree,” so he could not possibly have harvested every bunch out of dozens of tall trunks; he also could not erase a deep furrow for its whole length without leaving human-sized footprints.  \n   – None of them could hide so many bananas before dawn without being seen or leaving peels.\n\n7. Motive  \n   – Only the Apatosaurus had a natural motive: hunger.  Bananas are perfect forage for a giant herbivore.\n\n8. Opportunity  \n   – Yesterday the dinosaur learned that food lay beyond the field after chasing Grog there.  At night, with its long neck and bulk, it could browse every bunch easily.\n\n9. Conclusion  \n   – An Apatosaurus followed the groove, demolished the banana grove, ate the fruit and, by its very passage, erased the trail and snapped the branches.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGrog, Droo, Father, Mother, Monkey troop, Apatosaurus\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nthe Apatosaurus (the same 75-foot dinosaur Grog struck with his club)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n– Afternoon, Day 1:  Grog discovers the banana grove and drags his club home, leaving a deep groove through brush and soft soil.\n\n– Night:  The injured, still-hungry Apatosaurus wanders near the field.  Its keen sense of smell (or curiosity about the trail Grog left) leads it to the fresh bananas.  Following the groove, the 25-ton animal tramples earth and scrub, flattening the furrow and snapping branches.\n\n– Reaching the grove, it cranes its 25-foot neck, rips whole bunches from the tops of the thin trunks, swallows fruit and foliage together and moves from tree to tree until every bunch is eaten.  In doing so it strips leaves and breaks stems, littering the ground with bare branches but no discarded peels.\n\n– Sated, the dinosaur lumbers away, leaving a ravaged grove and an obliterated trail.\n\n– Morning, Day 2:  Grog and family follow the groove, lose it where the dinosaur’s feet churned the soil to mud, notice the broken vegetation and finally discover the stripped grove.  From those clues Grog deduces that only something as big as the Apatosaurus he met the previous day could have done it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Father – Heard snoring all night; worried about Grog’s safety, not food; could not harvest all bananas alone nor erase the furrow with human feet.\n\n• Mother – Enjoyed the bananas and had no reason to destroy them; also in the cave all night.\n\n• Droo – Jealous but physically incapable of climbing the trees, harvesting every bunch or carrying them off before dawn; would have left peels.\n\n• Monkey troop – Would have left piles of banana peels (as shown earlier when the monkey tossed each one); branches would not be massively cracked.\n\n• Grog – Wants the bananas for his family; no self-sabotage.\n\nOnly the gigantic, hungry Apatosaurus fits every piece of evidence and had both motive and physical capacity to commit the “theft.”\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

      "mystery_text": "65 million years ago, Grog the caveman fell asleep under the sun. He snored, enjoying a long nap. He dreamed he was chasing a dinosaur, and that the dinosaur was afraid of Grog's mighty club. It was the dinosaur that ran, and it was Grog who was triumphant. But then Grog was woken up -- by the roaring of a real dinosaur. And his day was only going to get worse … Grog noticed the sun was gone -- he was now in the 75-foot shadow of an Apatosaurus. The dinosaur eyed Grog curiously, then lowered its head down for a closer look. The dinosaur was always hungry, and its neck was 25 feet long -- almost as long as its tail. As the dinosaur stretched its neck towards Grog, the caveman could see its two shining black eyes drawing closer and closer. Grog grabbed his club, and bashed the dinosaur's head. It roared with pain, pulling its neck back, and then charged angrily towards Grog. He felt the ground shaking as he ran, while the dinosaur's 25-ton body stomped furiously towards him. The enraged beast lowered its head as it moved, and Grog desperately swung his club again. The club missed the dinosaur, but it squealed with rage as it lifted its head away. Grog scrambled for a grove of trees where it was too thick for the dinosaur to follow him. He could hear nothing, save for the sound of his own panting lungs. Behind a rock, Grog dared to peek, but the angry dinosaur had stopped running, and seemed more interested in eating a large cluster of bushes. A monkey laughed in the tree above Grog. But Grog was about to become the first man to ever solve a mystery. Because Grog was tired of being chased. He wanted another nap. And he wanted dinner. Grog scowled at the monkey. He wondered if the monkey would fear his mighty club. Or, if the monkey would chase him, too. The monkey seemed unafraid, and even playful, chattering happily from the highest branch. Grog saw why the monkey was happy -- it was eating! Grog still wanted dinner. He wondered if he could eat a monkey. Or, if he could climb the tree, he could steal the monkey's food. The monkey looked down at Grog suspiciously. It made monkey noises, swinging over to the nearest branch. Soon it would disappear among the trees. Grog tried not to crack the branches on the ground, so the monkey wouldn't know Grog was following him. The monkey was afraid of Grog's club, he thought, and Grog wanted something to be afraid of him today -- even if it was just a monkey. But he was also curious where the monkey was going. Further ahead he could just see the monkey's furry brown body swinging through the trees. Suddenly the trees became shorter, with shady fronds that were dark and green. Sweet smells filled the air, and Grog felt as though he were dreaming again. The monkey had led him to the most wonderful thing he had ever seen: Enough bananas for 100 dinners! Grog smiled, his eyes moist with happiness. He imagined himself eating a banana. And then another. And then another, and another. Maybe he'd make a bed from banana peels, or wear clothes made from banana peels! And when the dinosaur chased him, maybe it would slide on all of the banana peels. And then Grog could beat it with his club. Grog hoped nothing would happen to his bananas. He shimmied up one of the tall, skinny tree trunks and picked a tasty fruit out of a bunch (and then another, and then another). Even the monkey chattered happily, as though having a rowdy mealtime conversation, and playfully tossed the peel from every banana over its shoulder without looking. The bananas glowed in the afternoon sun, but Grog realized that the sun was lowering in the sky. He would return to his family, and remember where he'd left the banana trees. He slid down the tree and swaggered as he walked, strutting with pride over his new discovery -- “100 dinners.” He carried a large bunch of bananas with him, and he dragged his mighty club in the ground behind him (leaving a deep groove in the dirt). Tomorrow when the sun rose, he would follow the line again. But this time, his family would follow him. And Grog would be a hero! Grog peeked cautiously into the field at the edge of the grove and raced to the other side. There was a gently sloping mountain, and Grog knew its trail well. Enormous boulders overwhelmed the dirt and grass, making it too difficult to climb for anyone but the cavemen. Grog could see black smoke rising in the sky up ahead. His family would be warming themselves by the fire, and grumbling about their hunger. Suddenly Grog was tackled to the ground. He angrily kicked and thrashed his arms in frustration, until he heard the other caveman laughing. He turned to see Droo, his younger brother, sitting behind him in the dirt and snickering. Grog threw a banana at Droo. Droo looked confused, as the banana bounced off his shoulder and plopped in the trail. Grog stared with exasperation, then picked up the banana and pulled back its peel. “Mmmm,” said Grog, sniffing the sweet banana. Droo now eyed the banana with hunger and greed. “Mmmm,” Grog said again. And when Droo was good and interested -- Grog threw the banana at him again. Then he ran for their cave. Droo had scooped up the banana before chasing after him, so Grog had a head start. Grog ran as fast as he could to reach the tribe before Droo. He left his club on the trail, and arrived panting and laughing. His family stared in surprise. His father and mother were warming themselves by the fire, just as Grog expected. Grog's mother smiled, and he sensed the tenderness in her kind eyes and long grey hair. And when Grog held up the bunch of bananas, their eyes lit up with joy. There'd be dinner for everyone tonight, and breakfast for tomorrow. Grog shared the news about the banana orchard hidden in the grove. He described its location, and how he'd used his club to leave a trail through the jungle. Grog's father seemed suspicious. It was dangerous to wander beyond the field, where the Apatosaurus lurked. Why had Grog risked his life -- chancing death for the family's precious older son -- to explore in the trees? Grog's mother listened with interest, but said nothing. She was chewing on one of the bananas, happy and quite contented. Droo was jealous. Droo had found no food, and had disappointed his mother and father. And Grog arrived with an enormous bunch of bananas -- which tasted funny to Droo. Droo had never been able to climb a tree, so he had never tasted one of the mushy fruits. He threw the banana peel at Grog, and was even more irritated when Grog ignored him altogether. The family slept peacefully in their cave that night. Grog dreamed happily of delicious bananas and his proud family, though all through the night, he could hear his father snoring. A gray sky woke Droo in the morning, and as he sat up he deliberately nudged Grog with his elbow. When the rest of the family woke, they began walking down the mountain together. Grog led the way -- past the boulders, down the trail, to the edge of the field. The sun was shining, with only the morning sounds of birds chirping happily in the jungle. Even the buzzing insects seemed cheerful today, as Grog spotted the deep groove that he'd made with his club. But there was something wrong. The trail quickly disappeared, as though someone had erased its path through the dirt, and everywhere there were cracked branches (though Grog hadn't disturbed them yesterday on his trip to the grove). Had someone else discovered his bananas in the night while he'd slept? Grog heard the sound of the river, and hurried forward, knowing the banana grove would be nearby. But all of the bananas were gone! Grog stared in disbelief at the empty trees, which just yesterday had been filled with sweet yellow bananas. The trees were there -- but the bananas weren't. There were only leaves and branches on the ground -- but no bananas! No bananas! Was Grog being punished? Did a tribe of monkeys steal the bananas before Grog could get them? Maybe the dinosaur was angry because Grog had bashed his head with a club. Grog looked suspiciously at Droo. Did his jealous brother leave the cave last night? He could have easily followed the trail of the club -- and then hidden the bananas so that Grog couldn't find them. But then Grog had the darkest thought of all. Perhaps the bananas were hidden by his own father. While they slept, maybe his father had come to the grove. Hiding the bananas would keep Grog from crossing the field. It was hard for Grog to see his mother stare sadly at the empty banana trees. Suddenly, Grog realized who stole the bananas.",
