On one day it's customary\n-- third Monday in February -- to remember all the greats\nleading the United States. For their presidential glory,\nwe present a rhyming story. But six lines will hide a clue.\nThere's a mystery here too! In some states, the schools are closed.\n(Special rules are now imposed.) But a boy named Bill forgot.\nThinking he would still be taught, he ran proudly to his school\nat 8:10 (which was the rule), Carrying quite recklessly\nSchool books teaching history. Yet the day had left its mark.\nAt the school, the rooms were dark. Through the window, Bill peeked, wary \nat the unlit school library. In the grey dawn's light he spied \non the building's dark inside. Bill saw paintings hanging solemn\nby the doorway's entrance column. They faced paintings on the wall.\nWashington was standing tall. Paintings there would represent\nEvery U.S. president. There were 44 in all,\nhanging from his dark school wall. George Bush senior, and his son\nstared back at George Washington. Lincoln frowned, and Reagan, too.\nAnd Obama. (He is new!) Cleveland, Clinton, Kennedy\nand Jackson (from Tennessee). Nixon, Johnson, Harrison\nall looked to George Washington. Suddenly, the room awoke\nand the presidents all spoke! \"Wake up, George,\" one painting said.\n\"It's the holiday you dread!\" They were teasing, and George smiled\nat the way that he'd been riled. \"Polk,\" he said, \"you've got it wrong.\"\nPolk replied \"It's been too long. Our spirits must wait a year\nFor this day to re-appear.\" Polk leaned grandly on a shelf.\nLincoln chuckled to himself. \"My dad and I both were chosen,\"\nsaid George Bush, his face unfrozen. \"So was mine! We both were winning!\"\nyelled John Quincy Adams, grinning. Two cousins were President.\nRoosevelts -- so confident. They gave Harrison some tweaks.\nHis term lasted just four weeks! Nixon said that pain he knew.\nHe'd left his term early too! Lincoln nodded, without speaking.\nWilson's painting started creaking. To the window he was pointing\nat something quite disappointing. \"In the White House, we worked lonely\nwith our best advisors only. But a young face pays a visit\nby the window. There -- what is it? Where the holiday light shone.\nSee that boy? We're not alone!\" Bill, embarrassed, turned to go.\nWhy he stayed he didn't know. But it was a chance to see\nfamous men from history. And to know and hear today\nwhat the presidents would say. Filled with awe and fascination,\nhe entered the conversation. \"Hello, Mr. Presidents.\n Hope you like your residence.\" \"It's quite grand,\" said Jefferson.\n\"My painting gets lots of sun!\" Monroe added, speaking slow, \n\"We can watch the children grow. Smiling while we watch them learn,\nhoping that good grades they'll earn.\" \"If you're smart,\" Abe Lincoln said,\n\"You could hang up here instead. We were all boys once, like you.\nYou could be President too!\" \"Or your wife,\" said Clinton, straight.\n\"My wife tried back in '08.\" \"It's a privilege that's earned,\nBased partly on what you've learned. I was poor,\" Abe Lincoln said.\n\"But I studied hard -- I read. Soon my speeches moved the nation,\nAnd I won inauguration.\" Andrew Johnson followed him.\n\"It was hard,\" said Johnson, grim. \"After Lincoln, I could see\nthat the states did not agree.

He'd hoped his war would be last.\nBut another followed fast. Johnson, Nixon, Kennedy\nall knew war, they could agree. But Nixon knew triumphs soon.\n\"I sent men up to the moon! But to be the one selected\nis the best -- to be elected. I lost once, but then I won.\nMy slogan? 'Nixon's the one!'\" Truman laughed at what he'd said.\n\"Papers said I'd lost instead. A mistake -- it's only human.\nThey'd wrote 'Dewey defeats Truman!'\" Ford said, \"Yes, my greatest news\nwas to be the one they'd choose.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nI reread every statement the paintings make and checked each one against uncontested, elementary-school U.S.-history facts, because Bill is described as a good but ordinary history pupil.  \n• Every president but one makes only correct, well-known remarks:  \n  – Washington, Polk, Lincoln, the Bushes, John Quincy Adams, the Roosevelts, W. H. Harrison, Nixon, Wilson, Clinton, Andrew Johnson, Truman, Benjamin Harrison and Jefferson (about the Purchase) all speak accurately.  \n• One canvas, however, states something obviously wrong to anyone who has ever heard the “only man who was never elected” trivia fact:  \n\n Ford said  \n  “…my greatest news  \n  was to be the one they’d choose.  \n  When the ballots all were sent,  \n  I’d been elected President.”  \n\nGerald R. Ford was never elected either President or Vice-President; he was appointed vice-president under the 25th Amendment and became President when Nixon resigned. A forged picture that did not “remember” this fact would blunder exactly in this way.  \n\nBecause every other statement is historically sound, the Ford portrait is the only one revealing itself as a fake. That is the painting Bill recognised as the replica that had replaced the genuine picture (which, he says, now hangs beside his teacher’s chair).\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGeorge Washington, James K. Polk, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, John Quincy Adams, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, William Henry Harrison, Richard Nixon, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Woodrow Wilson, Harry S. Truman, Gerald R. Ford, Benjamin Harrison\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nGerald Rudolph Ford (the forged painting of President Gerald R. Ford)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nSome time before the school closed for Presidents’ Day, someone removed the authentic portrait of President Gerald R. Ford from the library’s “gallery of presidents” and hung up a hastily painted copy in its place.  \nWhen Bill arrived at the deserted school he overheard the portraits talking. Each canvas spoke lines in keeping with its real wearer’s history—until the Ford painting claimed he had “been elected President”. Bill, who had just reviewed that very fact in his history book, knew instantly that the real Gerald Ford would never say he had been elected. Realising that the bogus statement could only come from a forged picture that “didn’t know its own history”, Bill concluded that the Ford portrait on the wall was a replica and that the genuine canvas had been spirited away. He also worked out where it had gone (“It hangs by my teacher’s chair”)—presumably taken home or to the classroom by the teacher, who planned to restore it later or perhaps use it for a lesson.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAll the other portraits utter historically accurate statements:\n• The Bush, Adams and Roosevelt pictures correctly note their family relationships.  \n• William Henry Harrison’s month-long tenure, Nixon’s resignation, Polk’s quip about the annual holiday, Missouri Purchase details, Idaho and Montana statehoods during B. Harrison’s term—all are correct or at least not incorrect.  \n• Jefferson’s “Not a state until Monroe” is historically off by a few years, but he is talking about the Purchase territory in general, not the specific state of Louisiana; the sentence can be read as “large parts of the Purchase did not attain statehood until the Monroe era,” which is true.  \nSince only Ford’s canvas delivers a flat, unmistakable falsehood that any schoolchild would spot, the others are exonerated.  \nThat makes the forged Gerald R. Ford portrait the single culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He's a forgery and hid it.\"\n\"Do you think Bill Clinton did it?\" Adams, in his fancy suit, \nseemed ready to prosecute. \"Or is Woodrow Wilson lying?\n Which fake president is spying? Finding fakes could be quite fun.\nMaybe Nixon IS the one.\" In this presidential garden,\nNixon said \"I beg your pardon?\" Then he gave a dirty look.\n\"Don't blame me! I'm not a crook! Can we find the guilty man?\"\nObama said, \"Yes we can.\" Through the window, Bill would stare\nat the talking paintings there. \"Do not let your faith be shaken.\nThe original's been taken. It's been hid, and I know where.\nIt hangs by my teacher's chair! but replaced here by a new one.\n(I could tell you weren't the true one.) Everything he'd said was wrong.\nLies come out before too long. I respect the rest of you --\neverything you said was true!\" Since he knew his history,\nBill could solve their mystery. And he earned respect immense\nfrom the room of Presidents. Now's your chance to do the same. \nPlay this President's Day game. Though they all looked grand and wise\nwhich painting was telling lies?",
      "answer_options": "(a) George Bush; (b) Gerald Ford; (c) John Quincy Adams; (d) Richard Nixon",
      "answer": "(b) Gerald Ford",
      "outcome": "\"Bush spoke true -- no lie he fed us.\nBoth his dad and he have led us.\nAdams said the same thing, too.\nAnd for him, it's also true.\nNixon lost, and then he won,\nwith the chant 'Nixon's the one.'\nAnd he sent men to the moon,\nonly to face crisis soon.\nNixon said that pain he knew --\nHe'd left his term early too.\nNixon's painting tells the truth!\"\nsaid the history-loving youth.\n\"There was turmoil in store\nin 1974.\nNixon resigned early then,\nbut we wouldn't vote again.\nHis Vice President instead\nserved as President and led.\nBut his next term we rejected.\nIt was Carter we elected.\nThis forged painting tried to claim\nthat he'd won that voting game.\n(\"When the ballots all were sent,\nI'd been elected president.\")\nFord's true painting would've said\nJimmy Carter pulled ahead.\nThough the presidency's fun\nIt's one thing Ford never won!\"\nAs the sun rose in the sky,\nBill then said a fond good-bye\nto the talking paintings there.\n\"Goodbye Presidents. Take care!\"\nAnd the men who'd led the nation\nnow knew the next generation\ncould solve any mystery\nand had learned their history."
