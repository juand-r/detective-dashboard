    "full_text": "NOTE: The reader should have at least a passing knowledge of American history since the early 1960s to around 1990 to fully appreciate this mystery. Four of the characters in the story are lying and are “exonerated” from telling the truth. The character who is “incriminated” is telling the truth. Terry Brennan was enjoying a glass of wine before dinner with his wife of over 30 years, Rochelle. The early June evening was perfect and, as they relaxed on the spacious outside patio deck, he was explaining to her how much he had enjoyed finding several long lost friends on one of the internet’s many social networking sites. “Since signing up on E-Friends a couple of weeks ago, I have found several of our old chums from the early 1960s.” Terry and Rochelle had known each other since they met in Mrs. Bowden’s afternoon kindergarten class in the fall of 1955. Neither of them liked to be reminded that was almost 54 years ago. Taking a bite of cheese, Rochelle, asked, “So, who have you found?” Terry replied, “So far I’ve become network friends with Billy Flowers, Jane Neal, Paula Newsome, Jimmy Smith and Larry Gerard.” “Why, I remember them well!” exclaimed Rochelle. “But, I haven’t seen or heard from any of them in almost 50 years. When our family moved across town in the summer of 1961, I lost track of all of them.” Terry chuckled, “Well, our family stayed put and I lost track of them too. Friendships change when you enter junior high school.” “True,” Rochelle replied, thoughtfully, “but tell me about them.” Terry poured another glass of wine. He was in a playful mood. “Well, there is much to tell, but since we are relaxed and in no hurry this evening, allow me to relate some of the emails they have sent me. See if you can figure out which one is telling the whole truth. Four of the five old friends I have mentioned have told me some things that, simply put, cannot be 100% accurate.” There was a twinkle in her husband’s eye. Rochelle knew that whatever Terry was about to say, it would be good. She said, “I’m not certain what you are getting at, but start talking.” Terry grinned. He loved a good story and was in his element. Now, he was about to share several of them with his still lovely wife. Life was good, he thought. He began, “Well, I know you and Jane Neal were friends, so I’ll start with her. By the way, I should say before I forget that I purposefully waited until now to tell you about E-Friends. I want you to enjoy this little brainteaser I’ve prepared for you.” Rochelle smiled at Terry, saying, “I’ve already told you to start talking.” “Smiling back, he said, “OK. Jane was the first of our old childhood pals that I found. I sent her a friendship invitation and she readily accepted. In a couple of subsequent emails, she told me that her life has not been a happy one.  Disillusioned by the Vietnam War, she traveled around the country in an old tour bus with a group of Ken Kesey style merry pranksters after high school graduation. But, she had, and still possesses, a serious side. Jane worked very hard on the Robert Kennedy presidential campaign during the summer of 1968 and voted for him in the general election. Nixon’s election threw her into a several year funk. She has been married and divorced several times and has had ongoing problems with drug abuse. Today, she lives in a commune in Idaho, sort of a throwback, retro lifestyle from the 1960s. To end Jane’s story on a high note, she claims to be more at peace with herself now than she has ever been.” Rochelle and Terry were enjoying the wine, cheese and conversation. Rochelle asked, “Who’s next? “Billy Flowers,” replied Terry. I saw him occasionally when we were in high school, but he, as you, moved to a different neighborhood and I mainly saw him in White’s Grocery Store, where I worked part time to pay for that old car I bought. The last time I saw him, I think, was just before the Spring Prom in 1967. He was surprised and pleased to reunite with me on E-Friends, although we were never close friends. His life has been a bit happier than Jane’s although he’s had his ups and downs. He is happily married, has lived in New York since 1975 and has three grown children and three grandchildren. Since moving to New York, his politics have gone from conservative to liberal. Indeed, in the last presidential election before moving to New York, he voted for Barry Goldwater, and then voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976. Quite a shift in political thinking, but I do recall that Billy was always a bit of an open-minded, free spirit.” Rochelle and Terry were in no hurry for dinner as he continued. “Next is Larry Gerard. Larry was in the US State Department for almost 30 years, spending much time abroad. In fact, his two sons still live in London, his last post before retiring. Since 2003, he and his wife Linda have lived in Texas. He spends much of his time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston, doing research for a book he wishes to write on the Johnson presidency. It appears to me that Larry has had the most professional success and happiest personal life of any of those I am speaking of now.” “What about Paula Newsome?” Rochelle asked. “Paula has an interesting story. She was one of the first of our peer group to get lucky financially. After college, she joined the staff of one of the major television networks. Recall the big hoopla over the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1976. During the years 1974-76, she was instrumental in producing the historical Bicentennial Minutes television segments, which ran up until the end of 1976. The series won an Emmy award and her career and reputation were made. Today, she is retired and lives in Los Angeles. She and her husband Alan had one son, who died of cancer in 1988.” Terry paused to catch his breath and sip a little more wine. He and Rochelle were having fun and there was one more story to go. “Jimmy Smith,” he said, “almost died of injuries suffered in a car accident in 1981. A drunk driver in a brand new Ford Taurus T-boned him running through a red light. He spent several weeks in the hospital and many months in physical rehabilitation. I admire what he has done with his life since. He and his second wife Charlene opened their own rehabilitation center and have been physical therapy instructors in Kansas City for over 20 years.” Terry and Rochelle looked at each other in the mischievous ways they both loved. Terry finished his wine and asked, “So, who is telling the truth? Rochelle told her husband who she thought was telling the truth and why. Terry asked, “Would you care to explain your reasoning?”",

Explain your reasoning step by step, considering:\n1. The motives of different characters\n2. The opportunities each character had\n3. Any physical evidence or alibis\n4.

Write down your thought process here.\n\n<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n<thought process here>\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\nWho are the possible suspects?

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe puzzle says four of the old classmates are “lying and … exonerated,” while the one who is “incriminated” is the only one who is telling the complete truth.  \nTherefore the task is to search each little biography Terry repeats and see which of them contains no historical impossibility.  \n\n1. Jane Neal  \n   • Claims she “worked very hard on the Robert Kennedy presidential campaign during the summer of 1968 and voted for him in the general election.”  \n   • Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on 5 June 1968 after winning the California primary; he was never on the November ballot.  \n   → Impossible. Jane is lying.\n\n2. Billy Flowers  \n   • Says that “in the last presidential election before moving to New York, he voted for Barry Goldwater.”  \n   • He moved in 1975. The last election before 1975 was 1972; Barry Goldwater was only the Republican nominee in 1964.  \n   → Impossible. Billy is lying.\n\n3. Larry Gerard  \n   • Spends “much of his time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston.”  \n   • The LBJ Presidential Library is in Austin, Texas, not Houston.  \n   → Impossible. Larry is lying.\n\n4. Paula Newsome  \n   • Helped produce “Bicentennial Minutes” for a major TV network during 1974-76; the spots ran until the end of 1976 and won an Emmy.  \n   • All of that is historically correct. Nothing else in her vignette conflicts with facts.  \n   → No contradiction found. Paula is the only one who can be telling the truth.\n\n5. Jimmy Smith  \n   • Nearly killed in 1981 by a drunk driver “in a brand-new Ford Taurus.”  \n   • The Ford Taurus was first introduced as a 1986 model (late 1985).  \n   → Impossible. Jimmy is lying.\n\nBecause only Paula’s story survives historical scrutiny, she must be the single person “telling the truth,” i.e., the “culprit.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJane Neal, Billy Flowers, Larry Gerard, Paula Newsome, Jimmy Smith\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nPaula Newsome\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nTerry Brennan tested Rochelle with a five-part puzzle.  \nHe repeated short autobiographical sketches exactly as they appeared in the old friends’ e-mails.  \nFour of those sketches each contained a historical impossibility—proof that the writer was embroidering or fabricating details:  \n• Jane couldn’t have voted for RFK in November 1968.  \n• Billy couldn’t have voted for Goldwater in 1972.  \n• Larry can’t spend his days at an LBJ Library that isn’t in Houston.  \n• Jimmy couldn’t have been hit by a brand-new Taurus in 1981.  \n\nOnly Paula’s story—about producing the Emmy-winning Bicentennial Minutes for CBS from 1974 to the end of 1976—matches the historical record perfectly.  \nTherefore Rochelle (and we) deduce that Paula is the lone correspondent whose account is entirely truthful, making her the “culprit” in Terry’s word game.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJane Neal, Billy Flowers, Larry Gerard, and Jimmy Smith are “innocent” in the sense Terry defined: they are the four who are lying, so they are automatically “exonerated from telling the truth.” Their statements each contain at least one impossible historical claim, demonstrating that they are not the truthful party that Terry wanted Rochelle to find. Only Paula’s narrative survives every factual check, so she alone is “guilty” of telling the whole truth.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Rochelle was now a bit light-headed from the wine and eager for dinner, so she spoke quickly. “Jane was lying. Robert Kennedy was shot on June 5 and died a day later on June 6, 1968. She could not have worked on his campaign all summer and then voted for him in the general election. Billy Flowers was lying, too. He’s another one who doesn’t remember his history right. He could not have voted for Barry Goldwater in 1972. Goldwater ran against Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The same goes for Larry Gerard. The Johnson presidential library is in Austin, not Houston. Now, Jimmy Smith’s story is not political, but he too has his facts wrong. If he was injured in 1981, he could not have been hit by a Ford Taurus. They were not introduced until model year 1986.”\n“So,” Terry said,’ “that leaves Jane.”\n“Yes, it does,” replied Rochelle, who arose from her patio seat to go inside. “She told the truth about the Bicentennial Minutes. They ran from 1974-76 and won an Emmy during the last year. That’s how she became wealthy and well known.”",

Quite a shift in political thinking, but I do recall that Billy was always a bit of an open-minded, free spirit.” Rochelle and Terry were in no hurry for dinner as he continued. “Next is Larry Gerard. Larry was in the US State Department for almost 30 years, spending much time abroad. In fact, his two sons still live in London, his last post before retiring. Since 2003, he and his wife Linda have lived in Texas. He spends much of his time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston, doing research for a book he wishes to write on the Johnson presidency. It appears to me that Larry has had the most professional success and happiest personal life of any of those I am speaking of now.” “What about Paula Newsome?” Rochelle asked. “Paula has an interesting story. She was one of the first of our peer group to get lucky financially. After college, she joined the staff of one of the major television networks. Recall the big hoopla over the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1976. During the years 1974-76, she was instrumental in producing the historical Bicentennial Minutes television segments, which ran up until the end of 1976. The series won an Emmy award and her career and reputation were made. Today, she is retired and lives in Los Angeles. She and her husband Alan had one son, who died of cancer in 1988.” Terry paused to catch his breath and sip a little more wine. He and Rochelle were having fun and there was one more story to go. “Jimmy Smith,” he said, “almost died of injuries suffered in a car accident in 1981. A drunk driver in a brand new Ford Taurus T-boned him running through a red light. He spent several weeks in the hospital and many months in physical rehabilitation. I admire what he has done with his life since. He and his second wife Charlene opened their own rehabilitation center and have been physical therapy instructors in Kansas City for over 20 years.” Terry and Rochelle looked at each other in the mischievous ways they both loved. Terry finished his wine and asked, “So, who is telling the truth? Rochelle told her husband who she thought was telling the truth and why. Terry asked, “Would you care to explain your reasoning?”",
      "answer_options": "(a) Bill Flowers; (b) Jane Neal; (c) Jimmy Smith; (d) Larry Gerard; (e) Paula Newsome",
      "answer": "(e) Paula Newsome",
      "outcome": "Rochelle was now a bit light-headed from the wine and eager for dinner, so she spoke quickly. “Jane was lying. Robert Kennedy was shot on June 5 and died a day later on June 6, 1968. She could not have worked on his campaign all summer and then voted for him in the general election. Billy Flowers was lying, too. He’s another one who doesn’t remember his history right. He could not have voted for Barry Goldwater in 1972. Goldwater ran against Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The same goes for Larry Gerard. The Johnson presidential library is in Austin, not Houston. Now, Jimmy Smith’s story is not political, but he too has his facts wrong. If he was injured in 1981, he could not have been hit by a Ford Taurus. They were not introduced until model year 1986.”\n“So,” Terry said,’ “that leaves Jane.”\n“Yes, it does,” replied Rochelle, who arose from her patio seat to go inside. “She told the truth about the Bicentennial Minutes. They ran from 1974-76 and won an Emmy during the last year. That’s how she became wealthy and well known.”"
