    "full_text": "The Westbrook High School gymnasium was decorated in WHS colors, green and gold. Volunteers spent most of the day hanging decorations and bringing in tables and chairs, while a kitchen crew prepared turkeys that would be served to hundreds of baseball fans at the upcoming dinner presentation. The rain that started in the late afternoon turned the parking lot into a mud bowl. But that didn’t dampen our spirits – not by a long shot. It was the first time in fifteen years that a Westbrook High School varsity team had won a state championship, a real thrill for one of the smallest schools in the state’s A League. That ranking was a remnant of the days when Westbrook itself had a much larger population. Over the years had come hard times, a factory closing, and families moving away to the further suburbs. But Westbrook High School had held on, with stubborn pride, to its A League ranking, competing against much larger high schools. Well, come to think of it, what other school in the state had received a personal visit from Derek Jeter, star shortstop of the New York Yankees? As generous with his time as he was gifted in the field, Jeter had hosted a baseball clinic at WHS last spring, as the baseball season began. Before he left, Jeter personally signed and dated a brand new second base bag, which was put in a locked display case to inspire the team. That spring, the Westbrook Black Sox – out of nowhere – had a winning season. Correct that – they had a spectacular season! They led the A League for the very first time. Coach Morgan claimed it wasn’t any of his doing. The Derek Jeter magic must have rubbed off on the team. And now, at tonight’s banquet, the high school sports commissioner would visit Westbrook for the first time. Students made jokes about it, “… Bet he needs a map to find us!” There were even rumors that Derek Jeter himself, who we all believed had kept tabs on our baseball team throughout the season, might come. But all of the excitement would end when Principal Carol Jackson came to me in distress. “Sam,” she said, “there’s been a robbery. I just can’t believe it. The display case! Mary Thornton just told me that our prize base is missing!” Why she was calling this to my attention, I can’t say. (Maybe it’s because I’m the very smart editor of our school newspaper, the Tribune?) Anyway, I followed where her bony finger was pointing, straight at the display case. The door was closed, and there was empty space where the autographed second base used to be. I felt sick. “Find out what’s going on, will you? People will be arriving in less than an hour.” I saw Coach Joe Morgan in his nearby office, his door wide open as usual, students going in and out. I gave him the news, adding that the principal told me to find out what had happened. “Glad you’re interested in sports, Sam. We could have used some support during our baseball season. The Tribune didn’t pay us much attention. Not that we needed it!” “Yes, sir.” I could see that he wasn’t going to be of much help. I remembered from Law and Order reruns that people often sounded like wise guys when they were facing an investigation. I’d find out what happened, and that would make a nice addition to my resumé when it came time to apply for admission to college next year. Sam Waters on the case! What would a Law and Order detective want to know? Of course … “Mr. Morgan, who had access to the display case during the cleanup this afternoon?” He thought for a minute, “There are just two sets of keys to the display cases. I have one set, and the principal keeps the other set. I gave my keys to Randy Newsom. He had some help cleaning the case this afternoon. Shorty Gilstrap was with him.” That made sense. Randy Newsom was the baseball team’s all-star captain, and Shorty, appropriately, played shortstop. They were an inseparable combination, on and off the field. I spoke with Randy first. “Sure, Coach Martin asked me and Shorty to clean the case.” “And ...” “We took everything out, the dusted the case. I thought it looked better, but it was just getting dirtier. Plus, Shorty had just come from Art 101, and I was worried that he would get paint on the windows, or on the trophies. … Not that we have many trophies.” “What happened then?” “Well, fortunately, Mary Thornton came by, proudly wearing her cheerleading uniform. She sure does look great in that uniform. It fits her perfectly …” “Randy. Focus! What happened with the display case?” “Oh, right. Well, Mary knew about cleaning stuff. She even had some Windex. We took everything out of the display case once again, and she sprayed the glass windows. Then she wiped them dry. ‘Put them back where you want them,’ she said. I did, and then she left. I had to run, so I gave the keys to Shorty.” “When did you notice that the second base was missing, Randy?” “I didn’t … it’s missing?” “So you put back everything in its place?” “Yes. I did. By the way, I was there most of the time. I only went to grab some Cokes. Then I had to go pick up my date for the banquet.” “Thanks, Randy. That helps a lot.” I sounded more confident than I actually felt. (Well, that’s how they sounded on Law and Order.) Next on my list of suspects: Shorty Gilstrap. “What’s up, dude?” he said. “I hear you were helping Randy clean the display case.” “For a minute or so. But I couldn’t stay long. I had to help bring in tables.” “Wait a second. Was the second base there when you left to see Coach Morgan?” “Absolutely, cross my heart -- and oh, yes, I returned the keys to Coach Morgan.” Next, I spotted Mary Thornton walking toward her locker, decked out in her cheerleading uniform, her sweater dangling below her waist, looking two sizes too big. “Hi Mary. Got a minute?” “Sure. What’s going on? Looking for a scoop for the Tribune?” “Something like that. Randy told me you were a big help in cleaning that display case.” “Somebody had to. Those two were totally hopeless. It seemed to be getting even dirtier, if you can imagine such a thing. Shorty’s nickname should be Pigpen!” “So everything was there when you left?” “I’m quite sure that everything was still there. Later, I did go back and take a second look. One of the trophies was just a bit off center. That annoyed me. I’d been working all day. Even had to take off my sweater, to keep it clean for the banquet. I got some keys from the principal, opened the door, moved the trophy, and then locked the case and returned the keys to her.” “Thanks, Mary. Now I know what happened to our famous souvenir.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Only two sets of keys exist.  Whoever stole the base had to be in possession of one of those sets, because the case was still locked when the loss was discovered.\n\n     • Coach Morgan’s set: handed to Randy  ➜  given to Shorty  ➜  returned to Coach.  \n     • Principal Jackson’s set: stayed with the Principal until Mary says she “got some keys from the principal,” then she returned them.\n\n2. When Randy and Shorty finished, both insist the base was still inside.  As captain of the team, Randy certainly would have noticed the school’s pride-and-joy missing; Shorty says the same.  Their stories mesh, and there was no complaint at that time, so the base was still present when Shorty locked the door and handed the keys back to Coach.\n\n3. From that moment on, Coach, the Principal, and anyone they lent keys to were the only people who could open the case.  The Principal never left her office long enough and had no reason to hide the base; she is also the one who raised the alarm.  Coach Morgan’s office was “wide open, students going in and out” – a risky place to hide a fifteen-inch square.  Nothing in his behaviour required him to reopen the case, and Sam never noticed him leaving his office.\n\n4. Mary Thornton, however, admits that she later borrowed the Principal’s keys, reopened the display case “to straighten a trophy,” then locked it again and gave the keys back.  \n     • That places her ALONE with the unlocked case after the base was last seen.  \n     • She was wearing a cheerleader’s sweater that Sam noticed was “dangling below her waist, looking two sizes too big” – just the right garment for hiding a bulky rubber base.  \n     • She herself supplies the motive: during the first cleaning she had marvelled at how perfectly the cheer-uniform fit and how little Westbrook had in the way of trophies.  An autographed Derek Jeter base is worth serious money – a tempting souvenir (or something easily sold on the Internet).  \n     • Her explanation about the “off-centre trophy” makes no sense.  The trophies were set up by Randy only minutes earlier and the case had been locked ever since.  Nothing inside could have shifted unless someone had already been rummaging around – i.e., Mary herself.\n\n5. Sam says, “Thanks, Mary.  Now I know what happened.”  The contradiction in her story (the suddenly ‘crooked trophy’), together with her exclusive opportunity and a convenient place to conceal the base, tells him she is lying and therefore the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMary Thornton, Coach Joe Morgan, Randy Newsom, Shorty Gilstrap, Principal Carol Jackson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMary Thornton\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Coach Morgan lends his keys to Randy and Shorty so they can clean the display case.  \n• All the items, including Derek Jeter’s signed second base, are removed and placed on a nearby table.  \n• Mary Thornton walks by, produces Windex and cleans the OUTSIDE glass.  She notices how valuable the autographed base would be.  \n• Randy reloads the display, locks the door, and hands the keys to Shorty, who soon returns them to Coach Morgan.  At this point the base is still safely inside the case.  \n• A little later Mary, wearing an oversized cheerleader sweater, asks the Principal for the second set of keys, pretending she needs to “straighten a trophy.”  \n• Left alone, she opens the case, slips the base up under her huge sweater, deliberately nudges a trophy slightly askew so her story will sound plausible, relocks the door, and hands the keys back.  \n• Moments before the banquet she “discovers” the loss and reports it to the Principal, hoping the trail will point to whoever had handled the case earlier.  \n• Sam spots the holes in her story and realises she is the only person who had motive, opportunity, a method of concealment, and an illogical explanation for entering the case.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Randy Newsom – Returned everything to the case and locked it while witnesses (Mary & Shorty) were still around; had no chance to reopen the case after the base was last seen.  \n• Shorty Gilstrap – Took the keys straight back to Coach and immediately went off to help with tables; the base was still in the case when he locked it.  \n• Coach Joe Morgan – Received his keys back AFTER the base had disappeared; his office was full of people, making it virtually impossible to conceal a bulky base.  He also had no discernible motive.  \n• Principal Carol Jackson – Reported the theft as soon as she heard and never left her office with the keys except when Mary borrowed them.  No motive and no opportunity once Mary returned the keys.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "I saw Principal Carol Jackson going into the faculty room near the gymnasium door, and followed her into the room.\n“An interesting case,” I said. “By the way, nobody told a lie. But nobody quite told the whole story, either. The only three students with access to the open display case were Randy Newsom, Mary Thornton and Shorty Gilstrap.”\n“What about Coach Morgan?” she asked.\n“Coach Morgan’s office is in plain sight, so he couldn’t have taken the base. After the display case was cleaned, Randy had to leave, and Shorty returned the keys to Coach Morgan. Plus, Randy didn’t even know the base was missing. And Shorty barely touched anything because he had paint all over himself.”\n“It’s quite obvious then, yes?”\n“Yes. That leaves Mary. To her perfectionist eye, the boys probably had left a display off center, as she says. But that was just an excuse. She didn’t exactly say the base was missing when she got the keys from you. I think she got your keys, opened the case, adjusted the display, and wrapped the second base bag up in her sweater, which would explain why it now looks stretched, two sizes too big.”\nPrincipal Carol Jackson turned red, “Sam, Coach Morgan has something to tell us. He wanted it to be a surprise to me, too!”\n“This is why I wanted the display case cleaned,” Coach Morgan said. “And also why I asked Mary to “steal” the second base from the case for me. Both Randy and Shorty were out of the building when I needed them, and Mary happened to be right there.”\n“I don’t understand?” I said.\nThis was supposed to be a surprise – not a mystery. … There’s somebody you should meet.”\n“Hi kid,” came the cheerful, commanding voice of the shortstop of the New York Yankees. “Looks like it’ll be a great banquet, after a terrific baseball season. Coach Morgan asked me to write “A League Champions” on this second base bag, above my signature. Hope it makes a good story for your newspaper.”\n“Yes, sir,” I stammered. It really was quite a story -- both the one I would write, and the one I would now keep to myself!",

I have one set, and the principal keeps the other set. I gave my keys to Randy Newsom. He had some help cleaning the case this afternoon. Shorty Gilstrap was with him.” That made sense. Randy Newsom was the baseball team’s all-star captain, and Shorty, appropriately, played shortstop. They were an inseparable combination, on and off the field. I spoke with Randy first. “Sure, Coach Martin asked me and Shorty to clean the case.” “And ...” “We took everything out, the dusted the case. I thought it looked better, but it was just getting dirtier. Plus, Shorty had just come from Art 101, and I was worried that he would get paint on the windows, or on the trophies. … Not that we have many trophies.” “What happened then?” “Well, fortunately, Mary Thornton came by, proudly wearing her cheerleading uniform. She sure does look great in that uniform. It fits her perfectly …” “Randy. Focus! What happened with the display case?” “Oh, right. Well, Mary knew about cleaning stuff. She even had some Windex. We took everything out of the display case once again, and she sprayed the glass windows. Then she wiped them dry. ‘Put them back where you want them,’ she said. I did, and then she left. I had to run, so I gave the keys to Shorty.” “When did you notice that the second base was missing, Randy?” “I didn’t … it’s missing?” “So you put back everything in its place?” “Yes. I did. By the way, I was there most of the time. I only went to grab some Cokes. Then I had to go pick up my date for the banquet.” “Thanks, Randy. That helps a lot.” I sounded more confident than I actually felt. (Well, that’s how they sounded on Law and Order.) Next on my list of suspects: Shorty Gilstrap. “What’s up, dude?” he said. “I hear you were helping Randy clean the display case.” “For a minute or so. But I couldn’t stay long. I had to help bring in tables.” “Wait a second. Was the second base there when you left to see Coach Morgan?” “Absolutely, cross my heart -- and oh, yes, I returned the keys to Coach Morgan.” Next, I spotted Mary Thornton walking toward her locker, decked out in her cheerleading uniform, her sweater dangling below her waist, looking two sizes too big. “Hi Mary. Got a minute?” “Sure. What’s going on? Looking for a scoop for the Tribune?” “Something like that. Randy told me you were a big help in cleaning that display case.” “Somebody had to. Those two were totally hopeless. It seemed to be getting even dirtier, if you can imagine such a thing. Shorty’s nickname should be Pigpen!” “So everything was there when you left?” “I’m quite sure that everything was still there. Later, I did go back and take a second look. One of the trophies was just a bit off center. That annoyed me. I’d been working all day. Even had to take off my sweater, to keep it clean for the banquet. I got some keys from the principal, opened the door, moved the trophy, and then locked the case and returned the keys to her.” “Thanks, Mary. Now I know what happened to our famous souvenir.”",

      "outcome": "I saw Principal Carol Jackson going into the faculty room near the gymnasium door, and followed her into the room.\n“An interesting case,” I said. “By the way, nobody told a lie. But nobody quite told the whole story, either. The only three students with access to the open display case were Randy Newsom, Mary Thornton and Shorty Gilstrap.”\n“What about Coach Morgan?” she asked.\n“Coach Morgan’s office is in plain sight, so he couldn’t have taken the base. After the display case was cleaned, Randy had to leave, and Shorty returned the keys to Coach Morgan. Plus, Randy didn’t even know the base was missing. And Shorty barely touched anything because he had paint all over himself.”\n“It’s quite obvious then, yes?”\n“Yes. That leaves Mary. To her perfectionist eye, the boys probably had left a display off center, as she says. But that was just an excuse. She didn’t exactly say the base was missing when she got the keys from you. I think she got your keys, opened the case, adjusted the display, and wrapped the second base bag up in her sweater, which would explain why it now looks stretched, two sizes too big.”\nPrincipal Carol Jackson turned red, “Sam, Coach Morgan has something to tell us. He wanted it to be a surprise to me, too!”\n“This is why I wanted the display case cleaned,” Coach Morgan said. “And also why I asked Mary to “steal” the second base from the case for me. Both Randy and Shorty were out of the building when I needed them, and Mary happened to be right there.”\n“I don’t understand?” I said.\nThis was supposed to be a surprise – not a mystery. … There’s somebody you should meet.”\n“Hi kid,” came the cheerful, commanding voice of the shortstop of the New York Yankees. “Looks like it’ll be a great banquet, after a terrific baseball season. Coach Morgan asked me to write “A League Champions” on this second base bag, above my signature. Hope it makes a good story for your newspaper.”\n“Yes, sir,” I stammered. It really was quite a story -- both the one I would write, and the one I would now keep to myself!"
