    "full_text": "Ed Beatty arrived at the train station half an hour before boarding time. He had booked a New York to Los Angeles train ride weeks ago and looked forward to it with child-like enthusiasm. However, he did not know that one of the porters assigned to his sleeper car was none other than the infamous Robert Fennell, a convict who had escaped after a dozen years in prison. Fennell was a larger-than-life character and the most famous of his generation of criminals. Fennell, now forty-four years of age, was a cat burglar, jewel thief, safecracker and bank robber par excellence; a master of disguises and a man of seemingly endless aliases. Now, he posed as a train porter to earn a few dollars and move freely about the country to avoid law enforcement. Ed and the railroad line would soon learn this the hard way. Ed did indeed look forward to a hard earned vacation, and the three day trip to Los Angeles to visit old friends was simply the first portion of it, for he intended to sail on a cruiseship and visit foreign ports before heading back to home and work. Boarding time for the train was ten a.m. Porter 1 warmly greeted him at the entrance to his car, took his baggage and stowed it for him in his first class cabin. Ed noticed the man to be a bit clumsy but politely said nothing. Ed spent the remainder of the morning putting his things away. Even the staterooms on railroad trains are not overly spacious, so Ed organized as well as he could. After this, he took a short nap before lunch. Porter 2, a distinguished looking man of perhaps forty, knocked upon Ed’s door around noon to announce that the dining room was open. Ed thought, “This man is much too elegant to be a porter on a train”, but considered that perhaps the railroad put its best foot forward for first class travelers. Moreover, Porter 2 possessed impeccable manners, as he had assisted Porter 1 in welcoming “Mr. Beatty” earlier that day and had embarrassedly apologized for momentarily forgetting Ed’s name. Ed thought nothing of it; Porter 2 had welcomed dozens of passengers aboard earlier that morning. “The poor fellow must be getting tired”, he thought. Returning from lunch, where he had spent a pleasant hour dining with and getting to know his fellow first class travelers, Ed returned to his cabin and took another nap before dinner. At six p.m., the third porter came on duty. Porter 3 appeared to be about forty-five and was not as friendly as the others—in fact he seemed slightly standoffish, although he was cordial and greeted Ed with a tip of his cap and politely but formally informed him that the dining car was open for the evening meal. Perhaps because he had just come on duty, Ed noticed Porter 3’s uniform to be especially well-fitted and freshly pressed. Ed enjoyed a wonderful meal and drinks at the bar with new friends afterward. After sleeping most of the day, he wasn’t tired at all and did not return to his stateroom until almost eleven p.m. At that time, he met Porter 4 in the hallway outside his cabin. The men exchanged perfunctory greetings underneath the bright light of Ed’s door as he started to enter his room to undress for bed. Ed, a private investigator for an insurance company and a keen observer of people and places, thought Porter 4 to be a little young to be a senior porter on a major railroad line, as he could not have been more than thirty years old. Still, the youngish looking porter deftly opened the door and ushered Ed inside in what seemed to be one sweeping motion. Climbing into the comfortable stateroom bed, Ed thought no more of the graceful young porter as the excellent meal and cocktails, along with the gentle rocking of the big passenger train, quickly put him to sleep. The next morning, Ed awoke before the breakfast announcement. As he washed and dressed to prepare for the day, he found that his briefcase, with his personal papers and foreign passport, was missing. Ed quickly reported this to the chief porter, who in turn notified passenger security. Ed, himself an experienced investigator, had a general idea of what happened but didn’t really learn the truth until speaking with his railroad counterpart. After explaining to Alan Webb, chief of security, what had happened, Webb shook his head and sadly said, “We learned after departing New York that one of our first class porters is, in fact, Robert Fennell. One of his prison pals told the local authorities, hoping to avoid execution next week. The problem is we don’t know which one he is, as all of the porters in your car are borrowed from other lines for this trip.” Ed knew well Fennell’s background and reputation. Ed explained his own professional background to Webb, who welcomed having another investigative mind to assist him. Ed said, “Well that explains how somebody could steal my briefcase from right under my nose. Fennell is the best thief in the business. He hasn’t lost his touch. Still, I believe we can figure this out. In fact, I’m pretty sure we can.” Alan Webb asked, “What makes you think so?” “Because I came into personal contact with all four of the first class car porters. I noticed quite a bit about them.” “OK. What did you notice?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nI began by listing what is definitely known.  \n• Robert Fennell is 44 years old, physically impressive, a consummate professional thief and a master of disguise.  \n• On this trip he has substituted himself for one of the four “borrowed” first-class porters.  \n• Ed met all four porters during the first day.  \n• Sometime between 10 a.m. and the next morning Ed’s locked brief-case was taken from his compartment.  \nTherefore I had to decide which porter best fits Fennell’s age, personality, competence and opportunity.\n\nPorter-1  \n– Age not mentioned.  \n– Obviously NEW to the work – he is “a bit clumsy”.  \n– Nevertheless he knew Ed’s name as soon as he saw the ticket and handled baggage without trying to hide in the shadows.  \nA man who has spent years living by his wits would not look so obviously inexperienced.\n\nPorter-2  \n– “A distinguished looking man of perhaps forty … much too elegant to be a porter.”  \n– Helped greet Mr Beatty earlier, yet only moments later “apologized for momentarily forgetting” his name – a giveaway that he had never actually memorised the passenger list.  \n– Mannered, self-confident, blending easily with the first-class clientele: exactly the sort of rôle a chameleon such as Fennell would choose.  \n– Worked the noon–6 p.m. shift, when Beatty was away at lunch, then asleep – perfect time to open the stateroom with a master key and remove the brief-case without being seen.\n\nPorter-3  \n– About forty-five, uniform perfectly tailored and freshly pressed.  \n– Slightly aloof, but otherwise behaves exactly like a career Pullman employee.  \n– Had only a few minutes, between Ed’s going to dinner and returning for drinks, to break in and search—a risky, crowded period.\n\nPorter-4  \n– “Could not have been more than thirty years old,” quick, athletic.  \n– Age is the problem: Fennell is 44. Even with expert make-up he might pass for 35, but not a youthful 29-30 under the bright corridor light.\n\nComparing the four, Porter-2 alone combines  \n• the correct approximate age,  \n• the poise one expects from a “larger-than-life” criminal used to mingling with wealthy victims,  \n• the suspicious lapse in remembering a name he had just spoken, and  \n• the safest window of time for the theft (while Ed was at lunch and the car was almost empty).\n\nThose factors outweigh the lesser clues attached to the other porters.  \nHence Porter-2 must be Robert Fennell.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPorter 1, Porter 2, Porter 3, Porter 4\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nPorter 2 – real name Robert Fennell (currently travelling under an unknown alias)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFennell obtained a spare first-class porter’s uniform from a friendly yard hand and joined the crew as “Porter 2”.  \nDuring the initial boarding he assisted the genuine Porter 1 so as not to arouse suspicion, quickly noting which passengers looked prosperous and which compartments contained easily carried valuables.\n\nAt noon he announced lunch to the first-class passengers. Once Ed Beatty went to the dining car, Fennell used the porter’s pass-key to enter compartment A-3, opened the small wall-safe, removed the brief-case containing cash, passport and insurance papers, and replaced the safe door so neatly that nothing looked disturbed. By the time Ed returned the thief was back in the corridor, polished and smiling.\n\nBecause the theft occurred hours before Beatty retired, nobody thought to look for the case that evening. Fennell finished his shift at six o’clock, changed into ordinary clothes, concealed the brief-case in a locked equipment locker at the far end of the car, and slept soundly while Porter 3 and Porter 4 worked the later watches. Next morning he intended to leave the train at the Chicago stop, but Beatty discovered the loss first; Fennell therefore stayed in uniform, hoping confusion among the borrowed crew would delay identification long enough for him to disappear at the next large station.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nPorter 1 – Clumsy and obviously inexperienced, he stayed in the car while Fennell was already off duty. His awkwardness marks him as a genuine relief porter, not the famously sure-handed cat burglar.\n\nPorter 3 – His immaculate, perfectly tailored uniform shows he is a veteran Pullman employee whose own road loaned him to this run. He was on duty only when the car was busy (dinner hour and the bar); a break-in then would have been foolhardy.\n\nPorter 4 – Although he had the night watch and the dexterity to enter quietly, he is at least ten years too young to pass for the 44-year-old Fennell under close, well-lit scrutiny. Beatty, a seasoned investigator, would have noticed heavy make-up or prosthetics had “Porter 4” really been an older man in disguise.\n\nThus Porter 2—and only Porter 2—matches Robert Fennell in age, bearing, boldness and opportunity.",

    "reveal_text": "Ed Beatty took his time before answering, and then began, “I rule out Porter 4. He has to be too young. Fennell is still young, forty-four, if what you say is true, but not the thirty-ish man I met outside my room. Porter 4 was certainly deft enough to be a cat burglar and safe cracker, as he was very quick and graceful ushering me into my room. He also could have been in disguise, but I got a clear look at him underneath the bright light. He is as young as he appears.\nWebb merely nodded and motioned for him to continue. “It would not be Porter 2, either. He appears to be the right age. He has the demeanor and social graces of one who has traveled easily in the upper crusts of society. However, two things eliminate him as Fennell: he forgot my name, and became flustered when he did so. Sophisticated criminals neither forget names nor lose their poise. Fennell especially.”\nWebb was impressed with this first class passenger who happened to be in the same profession as he and told him so. “You noticed much. More importantly, you are able to make sense of it.”\nEd nodded his head in acknowledgment. He liked the railroad security man as much as Investigator Webb liked him. He continued. “It couldn’t have been Porter 1. Porter 1 was friendly enough and, had I spent more time around him, would possibly have seen that he possesses the engaging personality of Robert Fennell. However, the man was slightly clumsy and, as you know, clumsiness is one of the hardest of human characteristics to emulate and act out.”\nAlan Webb and his victim-turned-co-investigator sat in silence for a few minutes. Both agreed, without saying so, that Ed Beatty’s observations were squarely on the mark. Finally, Webb stated, “It had to be Porter 3.”\n“Yeah, it had to be. Porter 3 was what you would expect from somebody like Fennell in his situation. He was not overly friendly; not rude but slightly aloof, not wishing to draw attention to himself. For sure he was the right age. His uniform was well pressed and fit very well—a sure sign that he paid attention to his physique and appearance. As I look back on my short encounter with him, I see his professional charm and manner, for it would not do to have anyone he came into contact with even remotely suspect he was the legendary Robert Fennell.\nWebb said. “Mighty good work, Mr. Beatty.”\n“Call me Ed. I assume you have somebody watching all four porters?”\n“Oh yes. They are in the rear holding tank until we finish our conversation. I believe we will have quite the story for the police when we arrive in Los Angeles. By the way, we found your briefcase in a passenger’s compartment in the next car over. Unless I am greatly mistaken, we will find your passport somewhere in Porter 3’s private quarters”\nThe men looked at each other, Mutual respect and the beginnings of a lasting friendship were their rewards for solving the case of Ed Beatty’s missing baggage quickly and professionally.\nAlan Webb had one more question.\n“Ed, would you like a job with the railroad?”",

As I look back on my short encounter with him, I see his professional charm and manner, for it would not do to have anyone he came into contact with even remotely suspect he was the legendary Robert Fennell.\nWebb said. “Mighty good work, Mr. Beatty.”\n“Call me Ed. I assume you have somebody watching all four porters?”\n“Oh yes. They are in the rear holding tank until we finish our conversation. I believe we will have quite the story for the police when we arrive in Los Angeles. By the way, we found your briefcase in a passenger’s compartment in the next car over. Unless I am greatly mistaken, we will find your passport somewhere in Porter 3’s private quarters”\nThe men looked at each other, Mutual respect and the beginnings of a lasting friendship were their rewards for solving the case of Ed Beatty’s missing baggage quickly and professionally.\nAlan Webb had one more question.\n“Ed, would you like a job with the railroad?”"
