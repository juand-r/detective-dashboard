    "full_text": "Bill Morris was in an expansive mood after the fine dinner we had just enjoyed. After the dishes were cleared, we sat by the fireplace. His eyes showed that he was far, far away. We were old friends, he and his wife Susan, and Mary and I. Mr. and Mrs. Tom Johnston, if you want a formal introduction. “It happened during our trip to Scotland last fall. We were anxious, Susan and I, to enjoy ourselves during this long-planned trip. So much so that when the recession hit, and things were a bit tighter than usual, we decided to go regardless. We knew that the money we spent would leave us with memories of our trip. It turned out that we returned with far more than that.” That got our attention. Mary was about to ask what had happened when Bill came out of his daydream and told the story, confidential-like. It struck me that had any strangers been present with us around the fire, the story would never have been told. “We were by the lakes, you know. Loch Lomond—that region, where there are treacherous moors as well—just like in the west of England, the Baskerville country. Yes, a man could get lost there.” We nodded, shivering a bit. “As a matter of fact, seven generations or so ago, one did!” Mary had to interrupt. “How did you find this out? And who was it?” “I followed the clues. You do so too, and see if you can tell me. But to begin with, of course you remember Susan’s maiden name, Susan Alice Macready?” Susan beamed with Celtic pride as I explained to Mary, whom I hadn’t known at the time of Susan and Bill’s wedding, “Of course! And at your wedding, nothing would do but we all wore formal Scottish attire, kilts, sporrans and all. There was a piper as well, playing as we gathered at the church.” “That’s right,” Susan said softly. “And now you’ll see, this was the trip I so wanted to take, to rediscover where my ancestor James Macready came from, so many years ago.” “It was in a little village, on the edge of the moors, quaint and folkloric in its way. It made me think of Brigadoon,” Bill said. “This was the town that James Macready had come from, so many years ago. Well anyway, we started up a conversation with the local innkeeper. We asked after the Macready family. “His answer astonished us. ‘They’re all gone,’ he said. ‘They died out many years ago. The last one was James Macready, who was lost on the moor. If you don’t believe me, take a look at our local churchyard cemetery. And there will be the records in the church office.’ “Amazed, we left the inn and walked over to the churchyard. It was just as the innkeeper had said. There were plots for a few families: Macready, Doone, Jenkins and MacGinnis. The last Macready was ‘James Macready, 1823–1844. Lost on the Moor.’ At our discovery of this grave, Susan gave a cry and nearly fainted. She had brought a copy of the family’s American genealogy, which began with the arrival of this very same James Macready in 1845. He had been born in Scotland in 1823, and died on the family farm in Pennsylvania in 1863, of wounds that he had received during the Civil War, at the First Battle of Bull Run, in 1861. It wasn’t possible that he had never come to America at all. If he had not, then just who did come and start the Macready family line in Pennsylvania?” “We stayed at the old inn, prolonging our visit, and talked with several locals with long memories. They remembered hearing the old stories from their grandparents, who had surely heard the same stories around the fireplace, like this one. The stories were memorized, with a detail or two added over the years for local color.” “Good thing it wasn’t a gas fireplace at that inn in Scotland,” I ventured. “That would upset the mood, I’m sure. Real stories require wood fires!” Mary shot a disapproving look at me, and Bill continued. “It seems that there were three suitors for a pretty—” “No, beautiful!” Susan interjected. Bill smiled. “Yes, a beautiful local girl named Lucille Doone. Whether this was the same family as that lawless one in the west of England, I can’t say. But they had something of the same rough and ready traditions. Her brother, Samuel Doone, always said that if anyone didn’t do right by his sister, that person would have to answer to him—and his hunting knife. “The suitors were James Macready, Tom Jenkins, and Jack MacGinnis. Their rivalry became well known—it was jealous and bitter. It was thought that Lucille Doone had made a choice, but if she had, she didn’t let on. Townspeople speculated that harm would come to the man whom Lucille chose, by the hands of those spurned. Rather than risk her beloved being killed, Lucille kept her own confidence. And so the mens’ rivalry continued. “Until the night James Macready was supposed to have been lost—for the locals spoke of it as though it had been no more than a week ago, and certainly within their living memory. There had been a country dance at a local farmhouse, and everyone was there. It was said that Lucille Doone would announce her choice of suitors then. The dancing to the fiddler’s tune was fast, and the time slipped by. Then came midnight, and the music stopped. Lucille Doone announced her choice—it was James Macready! “Jack MacGinnis left first. He grumbled about the lateness of the hour. He never went out without his dogs, and they could be heard barking as MacGinnis walked the half mile or so to his own farm. “James Macready left next. He was going straight over the moor, which everyone always said should never be attempted at night, it was that treacherous. But it was a full moon, and with the excitement, and a wedding now to think of, he wanted to put his affairs in order. He chastely bid Lucille goodbye and was never seen again. There was just the scarf that she had given him when she made her announcement—it was found tied to a tree branch along a pathway in the middle of the moor. That’s how the people knew what happened to poor James. “The last suitor to leave was Tom Jenkins. From the name, you will have suspected that he was an Englishman, and that he was, sure enough. Or rather, his grandparents were, when they had settled here. Now, English or not, we were told that you’d not find a better Scots family than the Jenkinses. Tom was hotblooded and a crack shot with his rifle, which he always carried with him. “Samuel escorted his sister home at the close of the dance, assuring that she made it safely. The next morning, Lucille kept waiting for her betrothed, James Macready, to call. He didn’t. And he hadn’t turned up at home, either. A search party was formed, for the daytime, of course. There seemed to be no clues for what had happened that quiet night on the moor. The search took five days, but finally, Lucille’s scarf was found and James was presumed lost. Lucille herself wore black at the funeral in remembrance of her lost love and the wedding that was never held. After a few months, Lucille heard from her aunt in Glasgow and moved there. It was said that the small village held too many sad memories for her to stay on. “That was that, except for the fact that suspicions were such that neither Tom Jenkins nor Jack MacGinnis could stay in the little town either. With Lucille gone to Glasgow, there just wasn’t any point in doing so. They did leave families here, and, it is said, wrote from time to time, but the letters were not saved, and a fire at the old library, which had housed records from the time, meant that nobody could be quite sure what had happened. “And so the legends began. And now it’s your turn. Perhaps you know, as Susan and I now do, just which man came to America under the Macready name and what happened on the Scottish moor so many years ago?”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. The American “James Macready” could not be the real James, because the village has a memorial stone that says the true James was “Lost on the Moor” in 1844.  \n ⇒ Someone took his name and sailed to America in 1845.  \n2. Only the two disappointed rivals, Tom Jenkins and Jack MacGinnis, had any reason to adopt that name. Each already had a perfectly good surname, so only the murderer—who had to disappear—would bother to steal the dead man’s identity.  \n3. Who had the best opportunity to kill James?  \n • Jack MacGinnis left the dance first and was heard walking off toward his own farm with his dogs. He was already half-a-mile away when James started across the moor; to reach James he would have had to double back unseen while keeping his dogs silent—unlikely once the barking had been heard all the way home.  \n • Tom Jenkins left last. He knew James had just set out across the moor, and, leaving minutes later, he could easily follow, overtake him in the darkness and do away with him.  \n4. Who fits the later American career?  \n • The Civil-War record says the immigrant “James Macready” fought at the First Battle of Bull Run and died of his wounds. Tom Jenkins is described as “hot-blooded and a crack shot with his rifle, which he always carried with him”—the very man who would volunteer for a shooting war.  \n • Jack MacGinnis is associated with his dogs, not with firearms or soldiering.  \n5. The scarf tied to a branch looks like deliberate stage-setting to make villagers believe James merely lost his way. The methodical staging again suits Tom, the calculating marksman, better than Jack, the emotional dog-owner.  \nConclusion: Tom Jenkins killed James, hid the body in the bog, tied the scarf as a blind, then left Scotland under the dead man’s name. The Macready line in Pennsylvania descends from Tom Jenkins, not from James Macready.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTom Jenkins, Jack MacGinnis, Samuel Doone\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTom Jenkins\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nMidnight at the country dance Lucille Doone announced that her choice was James Macready.  \n• Jack MacGinnis, furious, stalked out first and trudged straight home with his ever-noisy dogs.  \n• A few minutes later James set off across the moor, taking the forbidden short-cut in the full moonlight.  \n• Last to depart was Tom Jenkins. Seething at having lost Lucille, he slipped his rifle from its sling, followed the path James had taken, overtook him on the open moor and shot him dead.  \nTom dragged the body into a peat bog where it would never be found, then untied Lucille’s scarf from James’s neck and knotted it conspicuously to an overhanging branch so people would think James had simply strayed and perished.  \nDuring the next few days Tom behaved like the rest of the searchers, but rumours grew. Knowing suspicion would cling to him, he quietly gathered what papers or small effects he could from the Macready cottage, went to Glasgow, booked passage as “James Macready”, and sailed for America in 1845.  \nIn Pennsylvania he married, farmed, and when war came in 1861 he enlisted under his stolen name. His skill with a rifle served him at Bull Run, but he was badly wounded and finally died in 1863. His descendants—Susan’s family—have borne the Macready name ever since, unaware that their blood ancestor was really Tom Jenkins.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJack MacGinnis: He left the dance first and was already well on the road home with his dogs barking—an audible alibi—while James was still inside. Re-entering the moor without those noisy dogs would have been impossible without being heard.\n\nSamuel Doone: He was busy escorting his sister Lucille safely home at exactly the time James disappeared. He had no romantic motive against James and was never suspected of leaving Lucille’s side.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "mystery_text": "Bill Morris was in an expansive mood after the fine dinner we had just enjoyed. After the dishes were cleared, we sat by the fireplace. His eyes showed that he was far, far away. We were old friends, he and his wife Susan, and Mary and I. Mr. and Mrs. Tom Johnston, if you want a formal introduction. “It happened during our trip to Scotland last fall. We were anxious, Susan and I, to enjoy ourselves during this long-planned trip. So much so that when the recession hit, and things were a bit tighter than usual, we decided to go regardless. We knew that the money we spent would leave us with memories of our trip. It turned out that we returned with far more than that.” That got our attention. Mary was about to ask what had happened when Bill came out of his daydream and told the story, confidential-like. It struck me that had any strangers been present with us around the fire, the story would never have been told. “We were by the lakes, you know. Loch Lomond—that region, where there are treacherous moors as well—just like in the west of England, the Baskerville country. Yes, a man could get lost there.” We nodded, shivering a bit. “As a matter of fact, seven generations or so ago, one did!” Mary had to interrupt. “How did you find this out? And who was it?” “I followed the clues. You do so too, and see if you can tell me. But to begin with, of course you remember Susan’s maiden name, Susan Alice Macready?” Susan beamed with Celtic pride as I explained to Mary, whom I hadn’t known at the time of Susan and Bill’s wedding, “Of course! And at your wedding, nothing would do but we all wore formal Scottish attire, kilts, sporrans and all. There was a piper as well, playing as we gathered at the church.” “That’s right,” Susan said softly. “And now you’ll see, this was the trip I so wanted to take, to rediscover where my ancestor James Macready came from, so many years ago.” “It was in a little village, on the edge of the moors, quaint and folkloric in its way. It made me think of Brigadoon,” Bill said. “This was the town that James Macready had come from, so many years ago. Well anyway, we started up a conversation with the local innkeeper. We asked after the Macready family. “His answer astonished us. ‘They’re all gone,’ he said. ‘They died out many years ago. The last one was James Macready, who was lost on the moor. If you don’t believe me, take a look at our local churchyard cemetery. And there will be the records in the church office.’ “Amazed, we left the inn and walked over to the churchyard. It was just as the innkeeper had said. There were plots for a few families: Macready, Doone, Jenkins and MacGinnis. The last Macready was ‘James Macready, 1823–1844.

She had brought a copy of the family’s American genealogy, which began with the arrival of this very same James Macready in 1845.

The stories were memorized, with a detail or two added over the years for local color.” “Good thing it wasn’t a gas fireplace at that inn in Scotland,” I ventured. “That would upset the mood, I’m sure. Real stories require wood fires!” Mary shot a disapproving look at me, and Bill continued. “It seems that there were three suitors for a pretty—” “No, beautiful!” Susan interjected. Bill smiled. “Yes, a beautiful local girl named Lucille Doone. Whether this was the same family as that lawless one in the west of England, I can’t say. But they had something of the same rough and ready traditions. Her brother, Samuel Doone, always said that if anyone didn’t do right by his sister, that person would have to answer to him—and his hunting knife. “The suitors were James Macready, Tom Jenkins, and Jack MacGinnis.

    "reveal_text": "Bill took in our rapt faces, Mary’s and mine, and grinned.\n“Why, I’ve no idea!” I cried. “Please don’t let this mystery stand a moment longer!”\n“I’ve given you all the detail you need,” Bill said. “Did one of the two unlucky suitors, or Lucille’s own brother, kill James Macready on the moor and then leave the country, taking the dead man’s name?\n“Jack MacGinnis never went out without his dogs, and their barking would have been a clear sign that he had gone out again and murdered Macready. Tom Jenkins was hotblooded, but his weapon was a rifle. No shot was reported heard.\n“A knife is a silent weapon, so Samuel Doone could not be exonerated by that fact alone—but he escorted his sister home that evening. Surely he couldn’t have killed her suitor. But think of this: the fact that Lucille Doone’s scarf was found neatly tied to a tree branch shows planning. If James Macready had lost his way, the scarf would have been found on the path, not deliberately tied onto a branch. It was left to make others believe that he had been lost on the moor. In fact, there was a full moon that night, and Macready could have seen the way home clearly enough.\nKnowing how hotblooded the suitors were, Lucille and James Macready conspired a safe way to be together. They told her brother Samuel of their plan to fake his disappearance. James Macready had not been lost on the moors; in fact, Macready left the area and made his way to America. Some months later, he was joined in the new country by Lucille.\n“And how can you be so certain?” we asked.\nSusan proudly produced the wedding certificate, from 1845, attesting the marriage in Pennsylvania of her ancestors, James Macready and Lucille Doone.",

It struck me that had any strangers been present with us around the fire, the story would never have been told. “We were by the lakes, you know. Loch Lomond—that region, where there are treacherous moors as well—just like in the west of England, the Baskerville country. Yes, a man could get lost there.” We nodded, shivering a bit. “As a matter of fact, seven generations or so ago, one did!” Mary had to interrupt. “How did you find this out? And who was it?” “I followed the clues. You do so too, and see if you can tell me. But to begin with, of course you remember Susan’s maiden name, Susan Alice Macready?” Susan beamed with Celtic pride as I explained to Mary, whom I hadn’t known at the time of Susan and Bill’s wedding, “Of course! And at your wedding, nothing would do but we all wore formal Scottish attire, kilts, sporrans and all. There was a piper as well, playing as we gathered at the church.” “That’s right,” Susan said softly. “And now you’ll see, this was the trip I so wanted to take, to rediscover where my ancestor James Macready came from, so many years ago.” “It was in a little village, on the edge of the moors, quaint and folkloric in its way. It made me think of Brigadoon,” Bill said. “This was the town that James Macready had come from, so many years ago. Well anyway, we started up a conversation with the local innkeeper. We asked after the Macready family. “His answer astonished us. ‘They’re all gone,’ he said. ‘They died out many years ago. The last one was James Macready, who was lost on the moor. If you don’t believe me, take a look at our local churchyard cemetery. And there will be the records in the church office.’ “Amazed, we left the inn and walked over to the churchyard. It was just as the innkeeper had said. There were plots for a few families: Macready, Doone, Jenkins and MacGinnis. The last Macready was ‘James Macready, 1823–1844. Lost on the Moor.’ At our discovery of this grave, Susan gave a cry and nearly fainted. She had brought a copy of the family’s American genealogy, which began with the arrival of this very same James Macready in 1845. He had been born in Scotland in 1823, and died on the family farm in Pennsylvania in 1863, of wounds that he had received during the Civil War, at the First Battle of Bull Run, in 1861. It wasn’t possible that he had never come to America at all. If he had not, then just who did come and start the Macready family line in Pennsylvania?” “We stayed at the old inn, prolonging our visit, and talked with several locals with long memories. They remembered hearing the old stories from their grandparents, who had surely heard the same stories around the fireplace, like this one. The stories were memorized, with a detail or two added over the years for local color.” “Good thing it wasn’t a gas fireplace at that inn in Scotland,” I ventured. “That would upset the mood, I’m sure. Real stories require wood fires!” Mary shot a disapproving look at me, and Bill continued. “It seems that there were three suitors for a pretty—” “No, beautiful!” Susan interjected. Bill smiled. “Yes, a beautiful local girl named Lucille Doone. Whether this was the same family as that lawless one in the west of England, I can’t say. But they had something of the same rough and ready traditions. Her brother, Samuel Doone, always said that if anyone didn’t do right by his sister, that person would have to answer to him—and his hunting knife. “The suitors were James Macready, Tom Jenkins, and Jack MacGinnis. Their rivalry became well known—it was jealous and bitter. It was thought that Lucille Doone had made a choice, but if she had, she didn’t let on. Townspeople speculated that harm would come to the man whom Lucille chose, by the hands of those spurned. Rather than risk her beloved being killed, Lucille kept her own confidence. And so the mens’ rivalry continued. “Until the night James Macready was supposed to have been lost—for the locals spoke of it as though it had been no more than a week ago, and certainly within their living memory. There had been a country dance at a local farmhouse, and everyone was there. It was said that Lucille Doone would announce her choice of suitors then. The dancing to the fiddler’s tune was fast, and the time slipped by. Then came midnight, and the music stopped. Lucille Doone announced her choice—it was James Macready! “Jack MacGinnis left first. He grumbled about the lateness of the hour. He never went out without his dogs, and they could be heard barking as MacGinnis walked the half mile or so to his own farm. “James Macready left next. He was going straight over the moor, which everyone always said should never be attempted at night, it was that treacherous. But it was a full moon, and with the excitement, and a wedding now to think of, he wanted to put his affairs in order. He chastely bid Lucille goodbye and was never seen again. There was just the scarf that she had given him when she made her announcement—it was found tied to a tree branch along a pathway in the middle of the moor. That’s how the people knew what happened to poor James. “The last suitor to leave was Tom Jenkins. From the name, you will have suspected that he was an Englishman, and that he was, sure enough. Or rather, his grandparents were, when they had settled here. Now, English or not, we were told that you’d not find a better Scots family than the Jenkinses. Tom was hotblooded and a crack shot with his rifle, which he always carried with him. “Samuel escorted his sister home at the close of the dance, assuring that she made it safely. The next morning, Lucille kept waiting for her betrothed, James Macready, to call. He didn’t. And he hadn’t turned up at home, either. A search party was formed, for the daytime, of course. There seemed to be no clues for what had happened that quiet night on the moor. The search took five days, but finally, Lucille’s scarf was found and James was presumed lost. Lucille herself wore black at the funeral in remembrance of her lost love and the wedding that was never held. After a few months, Lucille heard from her aunt in Glasgow and moved there. It was said that the small village held too many sad memories for her to stay on. “That was that, except for the fact that suspicions were such that neither Tom Jenkins nor Jack MacGinnis could stay in the little town either. With Lucille gone to Glasgow, there just wasn’t any point in doing so. They did leave families here, and, it is said, wrote from time to time, but the letters were not saved, and a fire at the old library, which had housed records from the time, meant that nobody could be quite sure what had happened. “And so the legends began. And now it’s your turn. Perhaps you know, as Susan and I now do, just which man came to America under the Macready name and what happened on the Scottish moor so many years ago?”",

      "outcome": "Bill took in our rapt faces, Mary’s and mine, and grinned.\n“Why, I’ve no idea!” I cried. “Please don’t let this mystery stand a moment longer!”\n“I’ve given you all the detail you need,” Bill said. “Did one of the two unlucky suitors, or Lucille’s own brother, kill James Macready on the moor and then leave the country, taking the dead man’s name?\n“Jack MacGinnis never went out without his dogs, and their barking would have been a clear sign that he had gone out again and murdered Macready. Tom Jenkins was hotblooded, but his weapon was a rifle. No shot was reported heard.\n“A knife is a silent weapon, so Samuel Doone could not be exonerated by that fact alone—but he escorted his sister home that evening. Surely he couldn’t have killed her suitor. But think of this: the fact that Lucille Doone’s scarf was found neatly tied to a tree branch shows planning. If James Macready had lost his way, the scarf would have been found on the path, not deliberately tied onto a branch. It was left to make others believe that he had been lost on the moor. In fact, there was a full moon that night, and Macready could have seen the way home clearly enough.\nKnowing how hotblooded the suitors were, Lucille and James Macready conspired a safe way to be together. They told her brother Samuel of their plan to fake his disappearance. James Macready had not been lost on the moors; in fact, Macready left the area and made his way to America. Some months later, he was joined in the new country by Lucille.\n“And how can you be so certain?” we asked.\nSusan proudly produced the wedding certificate, from 1845, attesting the marriage in Pennsylvania of her ancestors, James Macready and Lucille Doone."
