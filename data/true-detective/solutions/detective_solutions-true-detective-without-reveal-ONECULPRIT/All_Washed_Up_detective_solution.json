    "full_text": "“That is exactly the wrong course of action, sir. I know these waters and these currents. To try to row to safety in the lifeboat would be an exercise in futility – quite possibly, suicidal.” “Yeah, you know these waters and these currents so well. Then what are we doing marooned on this desert island, Captain?” Kildare took a swing at Jim Jensen. The younger man nimbly ducked, then pushed the Captain down into the sand. “You’re the one who got us into this mess, old man,” he sneered. “And I’m the man to get us out of it. Who’s with me?” Kevin Morton helped Captain Kildare to his feet, holding the ancient mariner back as he struggled to get at Jensen. “I’m with the Captain,” Marvin Fishback piped up, glancing anxiously out at the ocean – passive now, but subject to furious change at a moment’s notice. “We should just wait to be rescued. We’d all be drowned if we’re out on the open water in the lifeboat and another storm came up. Besides, I’m in no condition to row a boat,” he added because when he’d washed up on shore two days earlier, he’d badly scraped them on the rocks and they were now swollen and infected. “Yeah, sure,” Jensen growled. “But your hands are still plenty good enough to lift food from the provisions chest, huh?” Fishback jumped to his feet and pointed an angry finger at the accusing man. “I never took anything but my daily ration! It-it must’ve been an animal that got into the chest.” “Seen any animals on this barren postage stamp of an island?” Mark Colson smirked. “I’m with Jensen. We have to take some action before we all starve to death or die of dehydration sitting around on this speck in the ocean. I’ll pick up Fishback’s slack.” Jensen facetiously saluted the man. “That’s more like it.” He looked around at the others. Pointing at Mark Colson, he said, “now I’m sure we have to try and row out of here, before Mr. Champion Kayaker there gets it in his head to set out all on his own like he did during the storm, when he tried to hog the lone lifeboat for himself.” “That’s a dirty lie!” Colson shouted. Kevin Morton had to hold him back now from taking a swing at Jensen. “You aren’t going to convince anyone by bullying or berating them, Jensen,” Morton said. He turned to the sixth member of the stranded group. “What about you, Latrisha? Stay or go?” “I agree with the Captain,” the young woman stated. “He’s the only one qualified to decide on the matter.” Her eyes blazed at Jensen. “Unlike a certain someone who had the bright idea that a week-long cruise off the Baja Peninsula in a rickety old boat would somehow work wonders on a failed marriage.” “Here we go!” Jensen said, throwing up his arms. “The good doctor has made her diagnosis. All her patients can die, so long as she gets the last word.” Lanigan slapped Jensen across the face. Morton shook his head and rolled his eyes. These people he’d been shipwrecked with were certainly no cooperative Swiss Family Robinson or jovial crew of the S.S. Minnow. They had all been passengers on Captain Kildare’s old restored yacht, which had proved woefully incapable of handling the squall that blew up unexpectedly one hundred nautical miles or so off the Peninsula. The Mary Kildare had been tossed around like a cork in the suddenly raging seas and then been torn apart. Jensen, Lanigan, Colson, the Captain and Morton had scrambled aboard the lifeboat before the yacht had gone under, while Fishback had been washed overboard, to wash up later on the same small, rocky island with the tiny beach on which the lifeboat had run aground. Now, three days later, with half the food and water gone from the lifeboat’s provisions chest, their chances of survival were slimming as rapidly as their physiques. So, when the blistering sun had at last sunk into the sea, it was a surly group of people that bedded down under the flimsy tarp on the open beach. It came as only a mild surprise to Morton to find Jim Jensen missing the next morning. The morning after that they discovered his lifeless body in the surf. Latrisha Lanigan examined her estranged and now deceased husband and then pronounced without emotion, “He was beaten to death. Judging by the decomposition that has already taken place, I’d say he died the night before yesterday.” “He was clubbed with one of the lifeboat oars,” Captain Kildare stated, striding back down from the lifeboat. “There’s a small crack in one of them. There’re bloodstains on the bottom of the boat, meaning he was killed on shore and then rowed out to sea, his body thrown overboard to try to conceal the fact he was murdered. But the currents took him right back to the shore where he’d come from,” the man added, grimly shaking his head. “The killer should have weighed his body down with something,” Lanigan said dispassionately, “because when a body decomposes, gases are released, which will force it to rise to the surface of the water.” “So, someone tried to confine Jensen to the deep, huh?” Fishback said, glancing suspiciously around at the others. “Get him to sleep with the fishes.” “Or maybe the sharks,” Colson said, eyeing everyone with equal suspicion. “To try to cover up his crime.” Morton stared down at Jim Jensen’s body gently rocking back and forth in the surf. “Hey, maybe he actually tried to row away by himself!” Fishback suddenly exclaimed. “Then he accidentally conked himself with an oar and took a header overboard, and then washed up with the boat back on this godforsaken island for a second time. It’s possible!” “No, it’s not,” Morton said, looking over at the lifeboat. It was turned upside down on the beach to protect its interior. “That boat’s in exactly the same place it’s always been since we got here. That didn’t happen by accident. The killer must have carefully returned it, again trying to cover up his crime. We have to face the fact that one of us is a murderer.” “Well, I can’t say he didn’t deserve it,” Colson commented. “The guy sure was a sour apple.” Lanigan and the Captain nodded their agreement. “And it’s one less mouth to feed,” Fishback added. Morton looked from one haggard, sleep and food-deprived face to the other. Then he snapped his fingers, snapping the shipwreck victims out of their stupor. “I know who killed him,” Morton said, staring directly at the murderer.",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What had to be done to commit and conceal the murder  \n   • Jensen was first clubbed, then he and an oar were put into the lifeboat.  \n   • The killer rowed the boat out, dumped the body, rowed back, beached the boat in precisely the same spot and turned it over again.  \n   • That means a single person, at night, had to (a) launch a heavy boat, (b) row it out and back alone, (c) beach it neatly in the old grooves and (d) drag it over so nobody would at once see the blood.  \n   • The murderer therefore had to be very strong, thoroughly at home in a small craft and able to handle a boat alone in the dark.\n\n2. Who is physically and technically capable?  \n   • Marvin Fishback – badly infected hands; he openly says he is unable to row. Not plausible.  \n   • Captain Kildare – old, tired, and the very man who keeps saying that putting the boat out in these currents is suicidal. He is the least likely to risk it.  \n   • Latrisha Lanigan – she is a doctor, not noted for any special boating skill or strength. Could manage an oar, but launching, rowing and beaching a lifeboat alone is implausible for her.  \n   • Mark Colson – “Mr Champion Kayaker,” already accused of trying to steal the lifeboat once and obviously able to launch and propel a small craft single-handedly.  \n   • Kevin Morton – narrator/detective; nothing suggests special boating skill.  \n   Only Colson clearly fits the technical requirements.\n\n3. Motive  \n   • Everybody disliked Jensen, but Colson had a special grievance: Jensen had loudly accused him of trying to hog the lifeboat during the storm and had just renewed that accusation in front of everyone. With provisions running low, Colson needed the boat and did not want Jensen spoiling his chance a second time.\n\n4. Tell-tale clues  \n   • A hardwood oar is hard to crack; it takes considerable strength – again pointing to the athletic kayaker.  \n   • The lifeboat was returned to the “exactly the same place it’s always been.” That kind of precision comes from someone who has already practised launching and beaching it alone – exactly what Jensen said Colson had done during the storm.  \n   • Kildare’s discovery of the cracked oar and blood was not privileged information – anyone could have found it once the boat was righted – so it is not incriminating.  \n   • Nothing Colson says provides an alibi; instead he is the first to try to justify the killing (“Well, I can’t say he didn’t deserve it”).  \n   • Once Morton realises that the killer must be an experienced solo boat-handler and that only Colson fits that description, he “snaps his fingers.”\n\nHence the only logical culprit is Mark Colson.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCaptain Kildare, Marvin Fishback, Latrisha Lanigan, Mark Colson, Kevin Morton\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMark Colson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOn the first night after the quarrel, Mark Colson slipped out from under the communal tarp, took an oar with him and confronted Jim Jensen on the beach.  Furious at Jensen’s constant accusations and determined to keep the lifeboat for himself, he clubbed Jensen repeatedly, cracking the oar and killing him.\n\nHe then pulled the lifeboat upright, loaded the body, rowed a short distance out to sea and heaved the corpse overboard, hoping it would drift away or be taken by sharks.  Confident in his boating skills, he rowed back in the dark, beached the craft in exactly the same grooves it had made previously and turned it upside down again so no one would notice anything different.  Exhausted, he re-joined the sleeping castaways.\n\nColson did not bother to weight the body; he assumed the current would carry it away.  Instead, the same current returned Jensen’s corpse to the island two nights later, and the blood and cracked oar inside the life-boat betrayed what had happened.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nCaptain Kildare – elderly and already convinced that putting the boat in the water is suicidal; unlikely to have risked exactly the manoeuvre he condemns.  Nothing ties him to the bloody oar except his discovery of it.  \n\nMarvin Fishback – his hands are badly infected and swollen; he could not have rowed a boat out to sea and back, nor probably lifted it and turned it over unaided.  \n\nLatrisha Lanigan – possesses medical knowledge but not the strength or nautical skill needed to man-handle and row the lifeboat alone.  Nothing links her directly to the oar or the boat.  \n\nKevin Morton – narrating observer; no evidence of special boating ability, no motive stronger than anyone else’s, and he is the one who logically deduces the killer’s identity.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

    "reveal_text": "Marvin’s hands were still raw and infected from his encounter with the rocks when he’d first washed ashore, rendering him incapable of rowing the lifeboat out to sea to dump Jensen’s body. As a doctor, Latrisha knew that burying a body in Davy Jones’ Locker is only possible if it’s weighted down, otherwise it will rise to the surface again, revealing the murder victim. So, if she was the killer, she would’ve weighed Jensen down with a rock or something.\n\nCaptain Kildare knew the ocean currents in the area and therefore would’ve known it would be futile to dump a body at sea, since it would just wash right back up where they’d all washed up originally. So, he isn’t the murderer.\nThat leaves Mark. He isn’t a doctor, and he doesn’t know the currents. But he’s highly capable of rowing a lifeboat, being a champion kayaker. He clubbed Jensen over the head with an oar, rowed him out to sea and then dumped his body in the ocean, hoping it would sink or drift away, or the sharks would take care of the evidence of his crime.",

But the currents took him right back to the shore where he’d come from,” the man added, grimly shaking his head. “The killer should have weighed his body down with something,” Lanigan said dispassionately, “because when a body decomposes, gases are released, which will force it to rise to the surface of the water.” “So, someone tried to confine Jensen to the deep, huh?” Fishback said, glancing suspiciously around at the others. “Get him to sleep with the fishes.” “Or maybe the sharks,” Colson said, eyeing everyone with equal suspicion. “To try to cover up his crime.” Morton stared down at Jim Jensen’s body gently rocking back and forth in the surf. “Hey, maybe he actually tried to row away by himself!” Fishback suddenly exclaimed. “Then he accidentally conked himself with an oar and took a header overboard, and then washed up with the boat back on this godforsaken island for a second time. It’s possible!” “No, it’s not,” Morton said, looking over at the lifeboat. It was turned upside down on the beach to protect its interior. “That boat’s in exactly the same place it’s always been since we got here. That didn’t happen by accident. The killer must have carefully returned it, again trying to cover up his crime. We have to face the fact that one of us is a murderer.” “Well, I can’t say he didn’t deserve it,” Colson commented. “The guy sure was a sour apple.” Lanigan and the Captain nodded their agreement. “And it’s one less mouth to feed,” Fishback added. Morton looked from one haggard, sleep and food-deprived face to the other. Then he snapped his fingers, snapping the shipwreck victims out of their stupor. “I know who killed him,” Morton said, staring directly at the murderer.",
      "answer_options": "(a) Captain Kildare; (b) Latrisha Lanigan; (c) Mark Colson; (d) Marvin Fishback",
      "answer": "(c) Mark Colson",
      "outcome": "Marvin’s hands were still raw and infected from his encounter with the rocks when he’d first washed ashore, rendering him incapable of rowing the lifeboat out to sea to dump Jensen’s body. As a doctor, Latrisha knew that burying a body in Davy Jones’ Locker is only possible if it’s weighted down, otherwise it will rise to the surface again, revealing the murder victim. So, if she was the killer, she would’ve weighed Jensen down with a rock or something.\n\nCaptain Kildare knew the ocean currents in the area and therefore would’ve known it would be futile to dump a body at sea, since it would just wash right back up where they’d all washed up originally. So, he isn’t the murderer.\nThat leaves Mark. He isn’t a doctor, and he doesn’t know the currents. But he’s highly capable of rowing a lifeboat, being a champion kayaker. He clubbed Jensen over the head with an oar, rowed him out to sea and then dumped his body in the ocean, hoping it would sink or drift away, or the sharks would take care of the evidence of his crime."
