    "full_text": "Special Agent-in-charge Sam Connors looked over the four men standing before him in the pouring rain. Their grim faces were lit up by the jagged lightning that streaked through the sullen sky, their bodies trembling with the rolling thunder that shook the earth all around. “We’re going to get Pee Wee Galento for sure this time,” the big FBI man growled. “Dead or alive!” The men nodded, fedoras dripping. They climbed into the rumbling Ford Model A, Connors behind the wheel and drove off into the storm-wrenched night. The tip had come from an old prospector who’d been digging for gold up in the mountains: a man was holed up in an abandoned mining shack on the edge of Splithead Canyon. The prospector had identified the man as Pee Wee Galento from the FBI Most Wanted poster he’d been shown. The men sat in silence as the car roared along the deserted high Colorado road, listening to the monotonous flapping of the windshield wipers against the windscreen. The surrounding rugged countryside was shrouded in liquid darkness, except when a crashing thunderbolt tore the heavens apart. Pee Wee Galento had knocked over eight banks and gunned down three guards during his five-month crime spree. He’d vowed never to be taken alive. Joe Franklin dug around in the front of his suit jacket; his hand brushing the butt of his .32 revolver nestled in its shoulder harness. He found his pack of cigarettes, shook a coffin nail out and offered it to Chester Morris sitting next to him in the backseat of the car. Chester shook his head, said, “Don’t smoke,” his knuckles white on the barrel of the shotgun cradled between his legs. “These young guys are all into clean livin’ now, huh, Sam?” Joe remarked. He nervously plugged the cancer stick back into the pack and put the pack back into his suit pocket. “How many years you been in law enforcement, anyway, pops?” Big George Ratcliffe asked the third man in the backseat. Joe snorted. “Pops! I’m retiring at the end of the year, as a matter of fact … sonny. Me and the wife are all set for the easy life – just bought a cottage on Lake Avery.” “Not bad, old-timer,” Slim Jameson commented, turning around in the front seat. “Me, I got some things to take care of before I turn in my badge.” He patted his left breast where his .32 was holstered. “Like Pee Wee Galento, for one.” “Plus, you don’t have the dough to live on Easy Street like Joe does,” Big George said, balancing a Thompson submachine gun on his plump knees. “Playin’ the ponies like you do.” Slim grimaced. “Yeah, I got a few debts to pay off, fat guy. But who don’t these days – with the Depression and all?” Big George grunted. “Tell me about it. The bank the missus and I have been dealing at for the past five years just went under. Taking all our dough with it. And us with four kids to feed!” “Why don’t you guys shut up already!” Chester rasped. This was his first manhunt. Sam Connors glanced in the rearview mirror at the pale-faced young man in the back. “Easy, son,” he said. “We’re all in this together. We’ll get our man.” Twenty miles on, they turned off the highway and onto a rutted trail that wound up the side of a mountain. Another hour of bone-jarring, rain-lashed driving brought them to within a hundred yards of the shack perched on the edge of Splithead Canyon. Light leaked out from around the edges of the shade-drawn front window of the shack, smoke from the stovepipe up on the roof. “Big George,” Sam Connors said, “you go around and cover the back in case Pee Wee decides to bust out a window and take a tumble into the canyon. The rest of us are going through the door.” The men piled out of the car and plodded forward. A bolt of lightning flashed and crackled almost directly over their heads, thunder exploding a split-second later. Sam Connors cocked his big, black .45 automatic at the door of the shack. He nodded at his men, then reared back and slammed his huge shoulder into the flimsy plank door. “Put ‘em up, Pee Wee!” he roared. “It’s the end of the line!” The bank robber leapt out of the chair he’d been dozing in, knocking over a table. A bottle and a tin plate crashed to the plank wood floor of the shack, along with stacks and stacks of stolen money – and the Tommy gun Pee Wee had employed to get the loot. He stared at the FBI agents, dazed and unbelieving. Then the lantern hanging overhead suddenly shattered, shot out, plunging the shack into darkness. Gunfire erupted like the thunder all around, muzzles blazing flame, wood splintering and glass shattering and men screaming amidst the hail of hot lead that seemed to pour from every direction. Chester lit the lantern he’d been told to bring with him and tossed it inside the shack, illuminating the carnage. The blasting ceased. The silence was deafening, acrid gunsmoke hanging heavy in the air. The men stared at the bullet-ridden body of Pee Wee Galento slumped over against the far wall of the shack and at the crisp green money scattered all over the floor. “I got a slug in the gut,” Joe grimaced from beside Sam Connors. “I took one in the shoulder myself,” the Special Agent-in-charge replied, fingering the small hole in his trench coat. “I think a bullet winged my ear chief!” Big George yelled from the broken back window of the shack. “But I’m okay.” He was still outside the shack, but his machine gun lay inside on the floor. “I guess I dropped my Tommy in all the excitement,” the agent sheepishly admitted. Sam Connors looked at Slim crouched in a shooting position along the side-wall. “What about you, Slim?” “I think I got a chunk taken out of my thigh. But that don’t matter. We got the crumb,” he gritted, glaring at Pee Wee’s lifeless body, “that’s all that matters.” Sam Connors glanced behind him. “You can come in now, Chester.” The young FBI man slunk into the room, clutching his shotgun. “I was, um, just keeping the front door covered – in case Pee Wee broke through you guys.” Sam Connors grunted, nodding at the bank robber’s gleaming black machine gun lying on the floor. “We got a lot of men shot, and shot at … considering.” “Considering what?” Joe groaned, holding his stomach. “Considering Pee Wee Galento never fired a single shot.” The FBI special agent grimly regarded his men, his .45 level and cocked. “Looks to me like someone else was after this bank loot besides Pee Wee. And I think I know who.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.   Who could have killed Pee-Wee?\n     •  Pee-Wee’s corpse is “bullet-ridden.”  A revolver or a shotgun makes a few big holes; the weapon that turns a man into Swiss cheese in seconds is a Thompson sub-machine-gun.\n     •  Among the five agents only one man carried such a gun: Big George Ratcliffe.\n\n2.   Could Pee-Wee have fired the Thompson that lay on the floor?\n     •  Connors has already established that he did not: no empty .45-ACP drum or casings are mentioned, and Pee-Wee’s weapon was found where it had fallen when he leapt from his chair.\n     •  Therefore all the automatic fire had to come from Big George’s gun.\n\n3.   Where was Big George when the shooting started?\n     •  Connors posted him outside at the rear window “in case Pee-Wee decides to bust out a window and take a tumble into the canyon.”\n     •  After the dust settles Ratcliffe is still outside the broken back window, yet his Thompson is lying inside on the floor.\n       →  The only way that gun could be inside is if its muzzle had been thrust through the window – the perfect position from which to rake the room without endangering himself.\n\n4.   Who shot out the hanging lantern?\n     •  The first burst from a Tommy-gun would shred a fragile kerosene lantern easily; Ratcliffe needed the darkness so the other agents would not immediately know where the fire was coming from.\n     •  Once the light was out, he sprayed the shack, killing Galento and wounding his fellow agents.\n\n5.   Motive\n     •  Ratcliffe had just complained that his bank had failed, wiping out his family’s savings and leaving him “with four kids to feed.”  A satchel of untraceable bank loot would solve his problems.\n     •  None of the other agents is under real financial pressure: Franklin is about to retire comfortably; Connors lives on a G-man’s salary but shows no money worries; Chester is the abstemious rookie; Slim has gambling debts but only a revolver – he could not produce the storm of lead that filled the room.\n\n6.   Why Connors knows\n     •  Connors can see that all the bullet holes in the shack’s front wall run outward, not inward – proof that the main stream of fire came from the rear window.  The only man at that window was Big George Ratcliffe.\n     •  Coupled with the facts above, Connors can point his .45 at the real killer with confidence.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSam Connors, Joe Franklin, Slim Jameson, Chester Morris, Big George Ratcliffe\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nBig George Ratcliffe\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n•  On the drive up the mountain Big George Ratcliffe is brooding about the savings his family lost when their bank collapsed.  The stacks of bills Galento stole look to him like salvation.  He plans to murder the bandit – and anyone else who gets in the way – and make the money disappear in the canyon darkness.\n\n•  At Splithead Canyon Connors posts Ratcliffe at the rear window.  That assignment is exactly what Ratcliffe hoped for: he will be the only man behind the outlaw.\n\n•  The squad bursts through the door.  Galento jumps up, knocking over his own Thompson and the bundles of cash.\n\n•  Ratcliffe thrusts his Tommy-gun through the back window and rips a short burst into the hanging lantern.  The shack is instantly blacked out; the other agents have no idea where the bullets came from.\n\n•  In the darkness Ratcliffe empties a magazine into Galento and sprays the room.  Bullets strike Franklin in the gut, Connors in the shoulder, and chip Jameson’s thigh.  A ricochet or return shot barely nicks Ratcliffe’s own ear.\n\n•  Hearing the incoming fire, the agents inside return random fire; Morris, guarding the front with a shotgun, never sees a target.\n\n•  When the shooting stops, Ratcliffe lets the empty Thompson slide from his hands onto the shack floor, leaving it beside Galento’s money to make it appear that Pee-Wee did the shooting.\n\n•  Chester tosses in the spare lantern, revealing the scene; Connors quickly notes that Galento’s gun is unfired and that the bullet pattern comes from the rear of the shack.  Only Big George could have been behind that window.\n\n•  Connors levels his .45 and confronts Ratcliffe, whose plan to snatch the loot has literally blown up in his face.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSam Connors – Led the charge from the front; he was wounded by gunfire coming from behind him.  Could not have shot himself in the shoulder from that angle.  No motive for theft.\n\nJoe Franklin – Stood beside Connors and was gut-shot from the rear.  Close to retirement on a paid-for lakeside cottage; no financial need and no automatic weapon.\n\nSlim Jameson – Inside the shack with a .32 revolver only; he was hit in the thigh by the same stream of bullets that riddled Galento.  A revolver cannot produce the volume of fire that filled the room.\n\nChester Morris – Was outside at the front door with a shotgun, never entering until the firing stopped.  A shotgun blast would have left very different wounds and pellet spread, not the clustered .45-calibre holes found in Galento.  Furthermore, he had no access to an automatic weapon and was the only man not shooting when the lantern shattered.\n\nBig George Ratcliffe – had the motive (lost savings), the opportunity (alone at the back window), and the means (the only Thompson sub-machine-gun).  The interior bullet patterns, the smashed lantern, and his gun lying mysteriously inside the shack seal the case against him.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

A bottle and a tin plate crashed to the plank wood floor of the shack, along with stacks and stacks of stolen money – and the Tommy gun Pee Wee had employed to get the loot. He stared at the FBI agents, dazed and unbelieving. Then the lantern hanging overhead suddenly shattered, shot out, plunging the shack into darkness.

Joe and I were both hit by single bullets, not a shotgun blast. And not two or three chunks of lead in a row, like from a machine gun. That lets you and Big George out. Not to mention, you weren’t even in the room, and Big George dropped his chopper … in all the excitement.”\nSlim’s hatchet face went white as lightning. “It-It coulda been Joe!” he squealed. “Yeah, he just shot himself to cover up!”\n“Like you said you’re shot – to cover up? Sure, it could’ve been Joe. Only Joe doesn’t need the money. He and his wife just bought a cottage on Lake Avery, or didn’t you hear?” Sam Connors steely grey eyes narrowed, his blunt finger tightening on the trigger of his gun. “But you needed the money, Slim.

A bolt of lightning flashed and crackled almost directly over their heads, thunder exploding a split-second later. Sam Connors cocked his big, black .45 automatic at the door of the shack. He nodded at his men, then reared back and slammed his huge shoulder into the flimsy plank door. “Put ‘em up, Pee Wee!” he roared. “It’s the end of the line!” The bank robber leapt out of the chair he’d been dozing in, knocking over a table. A bottle and a tin plate crashed to the plank wood floor of the shack, along with stacks and stacks of stolen money – and the Tommy gun Pee Wee had employed to get the loot. He stared at the FBI agents, dazed and unbelieving. Then the lantern hanging overhead suddenly shattered, shot out, plunging the shack into darkness. Gunfire erupted like the thunder all around, muzzles blazing flame, wood splintering and glass shattering and men screaming amidst the hail of hot lead that seemed to pour from every direction. Chester lit the lantern he’d been told to bring with him and tossed it inside the shack, illuminating the carnage. The blasting ceased. The silence was deafening, acrid gunsmoke hanging heavy in the air. The men stared at the bullet-ridden body of Pee Wee Galento slumped over against the far wall of the shack and at the crisp green money scattered all over the floor. “I got a slug in the gut,” Joe grimaced from beside Sam Connors. “I took one in the shoulder myself,” the Special Agent-in-charge replied, fingering the small hole in his trench coat. “I think a bullet winged my ear chief!” Big George yelled from the broken back window of the shack. “But I’m okay.” He was still outside the shack, but his machine gun lay inside on the floor. “I guess I dropped my Tommy in all the excitement,” the agent sheepishly admitted. Sam Connors looked at Slim crouched in a shooting position along the side-wall. “What about you, Slim?” “I think I got a chunk taken out of my thigh. But that don’t matter. We got the crumb,” he gritted, glaring at Pee Wee’s lifeless body, “that’s all that matters.” Sam Connors glanced behind him. “You can come in now, Chester.” The young FBI man slunk into the room, clutching his shotgun. “I was, um, just keeping the front door covered – in case Pee Wee broke through you guys.” Sam Connors grunted, nodding at the bank robber’s gleaming black machine gun lying on the floor. “We got a lot of men shot, and shot at … considering.” “Considering what?” Joe groaned, holding his stomach. “Considering Pee Wee Galento never fired a single shot.” The FBI special agent grimly regarded his men, his .45 level and cocked. “Looks to me like someone else was after this bank loot besides Pee Wee. And I think I know who.”",

      "answer": "(d) Slim Jameson",
      "outcome": "“What!? Who?” Joe gasped. “Who’s the dirty rat who’d ambush his own colleagues?”\nSam Connors pointed his big gun at Slim. “Drop the heater, Jameson,” he ordered. “You’re not getting the loot – over any of our dead bodies.”\nChester swung his shotgun around on Slim, backing up his boss. “Why Slim?” he asked.\n“It figures. Joe and I were both hit by single bullets, not a shotgun blast. And not two or three chunks of lead in a row, like from a machine gun. That lets you and Big George out. Not to mention, you weren’t even in the room, and Big George dropped his chopper … in all the excitement.”\nSlim’s hatchet face went white as lightning. “It-It coulda been Joe!” he squealed. “Yeah, he just shot himself to cover up!”\n“Like you said you’re shot – to cover up? Sure, it could’ve been Joe. Only Joe doesn’t need the money. He and his wife just bought a cottage on Lake Avery, or didn’t you hear?” Sam Connors steely grey eyes narrowed, his blunt finger tightening on the trigger of his gun. “But you needed the money, Slim. To pay off all those gambling debts of yours.”\nSlim’s smoking .32 had been hanging down at his side. And now it suddenly jerked up.\nBut the slim man wasn’t fast enough. He joined Pee Wee Galento on the floor of the shack."
