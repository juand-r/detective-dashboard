    "full_text": "\"I remember the white hats,\" said Grandpa. \"And I remember the men who wore them.\" It had stayed with him all these decades, along with a story even he didn't believe, a miracle which couldn't have happened. But it did. \"First came Ernie...\" Grandpa remembered, with a smile in his voice. \"He'd come from Montana and even grew up on a ranch. Here he was, just 18 years old, and he'd never even been away from home. And for some reason that morning, the sun wasn't shining.\" Grandpa was 83 years old, but he still remembered that day, and Ernie's fear, for one simple reason. \"I was 18 years old too, and I hadn't been away from home either.\" The enormous Navy cruiser stood before him, standing on a foggy dock in San Francisco, when he'd met Ernie and discovered they'd be shipping out together into the Pacific Ocean. \"Ernie had freckles and red hair,\" Grandpa said. \"We both acted brave, and we didn't talk about it. But maybe we didn't have to. I knew he was just as scared as me.\" Grandpa worked on a farm in Iowa, and remembered growing up in the 1930s. \"All through high school history class, they'd talked about \"the Great War\" after 1917. And now we were at it again. There were songs, movies, and even radio speeches by the President of the United States. Everyone felt united, around this thing we had to do. \"And that's why Ernie and I were standing on the dock.\" Every detail of that day burned itself into Grandpa's memory. \"There was a wise guy from New York - a real fast talker named Doug. Doug claimed he wasn't scared at all, that he'd only signed up for a steady paycheck. Soon he was even teasing Ernie about being a hick from Montana. \"Ernie didn't know what to say, until suddenly he announced, 'Well, I have a wife waiting for me back home.' Doug sensed Ernie was making the whole thing up, of course, so he demanded 'What's your wife's name?'\" \"Betty!\" Ernie said, quickly. We both laughed, almost admiring the way Ernie stuck to his story. Ernie sensed we were his friends, and he started to let his guard down. \"I suppose you're married to Betty Grable, the movie star,\" Doug said, good-naturedly. \"Ernie laughed and said 'How'd you know!' and we all laughed with him. The truth is, we were glad to have something to talk about that wasn't as scary as the battles to come. \"Then when we got to our room, there were two bunks on each wall, and across from ours was a man named Chet. As soon as we got there, Doug spotted the picture Chet had put on the wall. And it was a picture of Betty Grable. \"'Hey Ernie!' Doug shouted, 'Chet's got a picture of your wife over his bed!'\" \"'It's the price I have to pay,' Ernie answered casually, 'for being married to a movie star.' \"Well, Chet joined in the teasing, saying he couldn't believe this red-headed kid from Montana was really married to a famous movie star. Chet was from California, so he'd met some movie stars, 'and they generally don't socialize with ranch hands from Montana!' More sailors heard our conversation, and soon it seemed like the whole cruiser knew about the red-headed 18-year-old who'd said he was married to Betty Grable.\" \"As the Navy cruiser cast off, Captain Stark called us to the deck. We sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge towards the naval base at Hawaii. From there we'd be headed towards the Pacific Islands, and would be playing our part in the battles to come. As the sailors stood at attention, Captain Stark explained the rules of the ship and the schedules we would keep. \"And he ended his talk on a very strange note. 'Men, I understand we have with us a celebrity. I understand this red-headed Apprentice here says he's married to Betty Grable. Is that right, sailor?' \"Ernie's face turned bright red, and the entire deck laughed as Captain Stark said 'Dismissed!'\" Grandpa's eyes grew strange as he talked about the things he'd experienced, and the people he'd shared it with. \"But the whole country came together, and we knew they were behind us.\" But the day Grandpa couldn't forget was the day they'd all met again at Ernie's funeral. \"It had been nearly 15 years since any of us had seen him after the war ended, and we'd all returned to our lives. But Ernie's family in Montana announced a memorial service for his friends from the Navy after he'd died unexpectedly in his sleep one night. We all flew there to be together one more time. It was Memorial Day, 1959.\" Grandpa's eyes became excited. \"It was good to see everyone again - my old bunk-mate Chet, and Doug from New York who looked just as slick as ever. We even called Captain Stark that morning, and with just two hours notice he flew up from his home in Colorado. Well, we all listened to the minister talk for nearly an hour, and Chet slipped out to help the minister's wife set up a guest book that people could sign. And then suddenly Doug nudged me in the ribs. \"I didn't know why he was being so disrespectful, but he said 'You've got to look over there.' Well, I looked, and I couldn't believe it. Everyone there was serious and respectful, and so was she, wearing a sad black veil and a black dress. But there was no mistaking that face. \"It was Betty Grable.\" I told Grandpa I didn't believe it. \"Betty Grable was married to a trumpeter!\" I said. \"From 1943 until 1965. They had three children together!\" \"Don't you think I know it,\" Grandpa said. \"I looked it up in Life magazine!\" \"Are you sure it was her?\" \"Chet even showed us where she'd signed her name in the guest book! For the next 45 years I wondered - all of us did. But I did some research at the library and found out she really had been in the state that weekend.\" \"Did you talk to her?\" I asked. \"When the minister finished speaking, we headed over to Betty. She knew what we wanted to ask, of course, but she just smiled a sweet smile, nodded graciously, and then ran for the door. We chased after her, but she jumped into a limousine that was waiting. Doug stood there for a second like he'd seen a ghost. \"Doug was so flabbergasted, he began grilling Ernie's mother, sister, uncle, and the rest of his family -- about whether Ernie had secretly married the movie star. Captain Stark eventually told him to stop acting like a jackass, and a genuinely embarrassed Doug apologized, saying he'd really underestimated Ernie after all. \"Maybe it's the miracle of friendship,\" Grandpa said finally. \"When you've been through so much together, even your jokes can somehow become real.\" \"I hate to spoil a good story,\" I said, \"but there's one man who set up Betty Grable's appearance at the service - and I know who it was.\"",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Clarify the “mystery.”  \n   • Nobody was murdered; the puzzle is: “Who arranged for Betty Grable to show up at Ernie’s memorial in 1959?”  \n   • So we must look for the one man with motive, means (connections) and opportunity.\n\n2. List the main male characters who could have done it.  \n   • Grandpa – the narrator of the war memories.  \n   • Doug – the fast-talking New Yorker who originally teased Ernie.  \n   • Chet – the Californian who owned the pin-up photo of Betty Grable.  \n   • Captain Stark – their former commanding officer.  \n   • (The minister, Ernie’s relatives, etc. are peripheral.)\n\n3. Check motives.  \n   • Grandpa-– loved Ernie but says he himself was astonished. No sign he felt guilty or had Hollywood contacts.  \n   • Doug – did a lot of teasing and might want to make amends, but his reaction (“like he’d seen a ghost,” then frantic grilling of the family) reads as genuine shock, not stage acting.  \n   • Chet – also teased Ernie, but unlike Doug he actually moved in California circles and boasted of having met movie stars. If anyone could telephone a Hollywood agent in 1959, it would be Chet. A final tribute to his friend would be a perfect motive.  \n   • Captain Stark – was called only that morning from Colorado; two hours is hardly enough to locate a major star who happened (by coincidence) to be in the state.\n\n4. Check opportunity and behaviour on the day.  \n   • The one man who disappears at the key moment is Chet: “Chet slipped out to help the minister’s wife set up a guest book that people could sign.”  \n   • Right after Chet’s absence, Betty Grable is first spotted.  \n   • Chet later returns and proudly points out her signature in the guest book – i.e. he had arranged for the book precisely so she would sign it.  \n   • None of the others leave the chapel; Doug actually notices Betty first, Grandpa stays in his seat, Captain Stark sits in the front pew.\n\n5. Means.  \n   • Chet’s California background and wartime California postings make him the only one likely to have genuine Hollywood connections.  \n   • He slipped away early enough to meet her car outside, coach her on what to do (“smile, nod, leave quickly”), then re-enter.\n\n6. Physical evidence/alibi.  \n   • Chet’s only alibi is “helping with the guest book” – which is exactly the task the organiser would need in order to get Betty’s autograph recorded.  \n   • Everyone else was in full view; only Chet could not be accounted for during Betty’s arrival.\n\n7. Logical synthesis. The repeated emphasis on:  \n   • Chet being from California and knowing stars,  \n   • Chet’s pin-up of Betty on the ship,  \n   • Chet’s disappearance at the decisive time, and  \n   • Chet proudly producing the autograph,  \n   make it virtually certain he is the arranger.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGrandpa, Doug, Chet, Captain Stark, (Rev.) the minister\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nChester “Chet” (Last name not supplied in the story)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen Chet learned of Ernie’s memorial service he decided to honour his buddy—and atone for the old teasing—by giving everyone the surprise of a lifetime: he would bring Betty Grable herself. Because Chet had lived in California and, during and after the war, had occasionally met film people, he still possessed a telephone contact who could reach the actress.  \nBetty happened to be making a personal-appearance tour in the region over the Memorial Day weekend, so Chet telephoned in advance and persuaded her to detour to tiny Dillon, Montana, for a five-minute stop. He promised complete discretion, a quick in-and-out visit, and arranged for a car and driver to wait.\n\nOn the morning of the service Chet arrived early, confirmed the timing with the driver and asked the minister’s wife if he could “help by putting out a guest book.” During the sermon he slipped out supposedly to finish that small chore but in fact to escort Betty from the limousine to a side door near the chapel vestibule. He positioned her so that, as soon as the sermon ended, the congregation would see her. She signed the guest book—her autograph being Chet’s proof—and, just as rehearsed, she offered a silent, gracious nod and hurried back to the waiting car before questions could start.\n\nA moment later Chet re-entered, appearing with the congregation and acting as astonished as everyone else. When Grandpa and Doug rushed up, Chet could theatrically “discover” the autograph in the book he himself had provided.\n\nThus the long-running ship-board joke about Ernie’s “wife” came full circle: thanks to Chet’s planning, Betty Grable really did pay her respects at Ernie’s funeral.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Grandpa – The storyteller is plainly surprised and never leaves his seat during the service. No Californian contacts or preparation time.  \n• Doug – Present the whole time, first to notice Betty; his stunned reaction and later embarrassment are inconsistent with being the organiser. Also, living in New York gave him few Hollywood connections in 1959.  \n• Captain Stark – Had only two hours’ notice of the funeral and was busy arranging his own flight from Colorado; impossible to set up a movie star on that timetable.  \n• The minister (and family) – Local clergy with no Hollywood ties, and they too looked baffled. They only accepted Chet’s help with the guest book.  \nTherefore all evidence converges on Chet, and the others are exonerated.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Everyone felt united, around this thing we had to do. \"And that's why Ernie and I were standing on the dock.\" Every detail of that day burned itself into Grandpa's memory. \"There was a wise guy from New York - a real fast talker named Doug. Doug claimed he wasn't scared at all, that he'd only signed up for a steady paycheck. Soon he was even teasing Ernie about being a hick from Montana. \"Ernie didn't know what to say, until suddenly he announced, 'Well, I have a wife waiting for me back home.' Doug sensed Ernie was making the whole thing up, of course, so he demanded 'What's your wife's name?'\" \"Betty!\" Ernie said, quickly. We both laughed, almost admiring the way Ernie stuck to his story. Ernie sensed we were his friends, and he started to let his guard down. \"I suppose you're married to Betty Grable, the movie star,\" Doug said, good-naturedly. \"Ernie laughed and said 'How'd you know!' and we all laughed with him. The truth is, we were glad to have something to talk about that wasn't as scary as the battles to come. \"Then when we got to our room, there were two bunks on each wall, and across from ours was a man named Chet. As soon as we got there, Doug spotted the picture Chet had put on the wall. And it was a picture of Betty Grable. \"'Hey Ernie!' Doug shouted, 'Chet's got a picture of your wife over his bed!'\" \"'It's the price I have to pay,' Ernie answered casually, 'for being married to a movie star.' \"Well, Chet joined in the teasing, saying he couldn't believe this red-headed kid from Montana was really married to a famous movie star. Chet was from California, so he'd met some movie stars, 'and they generally don't socialize with ranch hands from Montana!' More sailors heard our conversation, and soon it seemed like the whole cruiser knew about the red-headed 18-year-old who'd said he was married to Betty Grable.\" \"As the Navy cruiser cast off, Captain Stark called us to the deck. We sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge towards the naval base at Hawaii. From there we'd be headed towards the Pacific Islands, and would be playing our part in the battles to come. As the sailors stood at attention, Captain Stark explained the rules of the ship and the schedules we would keep. \"And he ended his talk on a very strange note. 'Men, I understand we have with us a celebrity. I understand this red-headed Apprentice here says he's married to Betty Grable. Is that right, sailor?' \"Ernie's face turned bright red, and the entire deck laughed as Captain Stark said 'Dismissed!'\" Grandpa's eyes grew strange as he talked about the things he'd experienced, and the people he'd shared it with. \"But the whole country came together, and we knew they were behind us.\" But the day Grandpa couldn't forget was the day they'd all met again at Ernie's funeral. \"It had been nearly 15 years since any of us had seen him after the war ended, and we'd all returned to our lives. But Ernie's family in Montana announced a memorial service for his friends from the Navy after he'd died unexpectedly in his sleep one night. We all flew there to be together one more time. It was Memorial Day, 1959.\" Grandpa's eyes became excited. \"It was good to see everyone again - my old bunk-mate Chet, and Doug from New York who looked just as slick as ever. We even called Captain Stark that morning, and with just two hours notice he flew up from his home in Colorado. Well, we all listened to the minister talk for nearly an hour, and Chet slipped out to help the minister's wife set up a guest book that people could sign. And then suddenly Doug nudged me in the ribs. \"I didn't know why he was being so disrespectful, but he said 'You've got to look over there.' Well, I looked, and I couldn't believe it. Everyone there was serious and respectful, and so was she, wearing a sad black veil and a black dress. But there was no mistaking that face. \"It was Betty Grable.\" I told Grandpa I didn't believe it. \"Betty Grable was married to a trumpeter!\" I said. \"From 1943 until 1965. They had three children together!\" \"Don't you think I know it,\" Grandpa said. \"I looked it up in Life magazine!\" \"Are you sure it was her?\" \"Chet even showed us where she'd signed her name in the guest book! For the next 45 years I wondered - all of us did. But I did some research at the library and found out she really had been in the state that weekend.\" \"Did you talk to her?\" I asked. \"When the minister finished speaking, we headed over to Betty. She knew what we wanted to ask, of course, but she just smiled a sweet smile, nodded graciously, and then ran for the door. We chased after her, but she jumped into a limousine that was waiting. Doug stood there for a second like he'd seen a ghost. \"Doug was so flabbergasted, he began grilling Ernie's mother, sister, uncle, and the rest of his family -- about whether Ernie had secretly married the movie star. Captain Stark eventually told him to stop acting like a jackass, and a genuinely embarrassed Doug apologized, saying he'd really underestimated Ernie after all. \"Maybe it's the miracle of friendship,\" Grandpa said finally. \"When you've been through so much together, even your jokes can somehow become real.\" \"I hate to spoil a good story,\" I said, \"but there's one man who set up Betty Grable's appearance at the service - and I know who it was.\"",
      "answer_options": "(a) Captain Stark; (b) Chet; (c) Doug; (d) Ernie",
      "answer": "(b) Chet",
      "outcome": "\"Maybe Captain Stark set it up.\"\n\"It sounds like he'd enjoy a good joke,\" I said. \"But you only gave him two hours notice about the service. That would hardly be enough time to set it up!\"\n\"I always wondered if Doug was somehow behind it,\" Grandpa said.\n\"I don't know,\" I replied. \"Doug was genuinely sorry that he pestered Ernie's entire family with questions. If he'd set up the whole prank in the first place, he wouldn't take it that seriously!\"\n\"Do you suppose Ernie himself planned the prank\" Grandpa asked, almost hopefully.\n\"He wouldn't have had time,\" I pointed out. \"You said he died unexpectedly in his sleep.\"\n\"But then who?\" Grandpa asked.\n\"Well, I don't know whether she'd be signing her name 'Betty Grable' in a guest book even after she was married,\" I said. \"But it sounds like you servicemen scared her into her limousine before she'd even had a chance!\"\n\"And Chet didn't even set the book out until after the service had started,\" Grandpa remembered. \"He's the only one who could've signed Betty's name for her.\"\n\"And he was the one who'd lived in Hollywood, and said he'd known movie stars.\"\n\"But why would Betty Grable go along with one sailor's prank?\"\n\"Everyone went through the war together,\" I said, \"and I can see her being deeply touched by the story of the humble 18-year-old ranch hand who left home to serve his country. Maybe this was her way of showing she was just as grateful as everyone else.\"\n\"To the men who wore the white hats.\""
