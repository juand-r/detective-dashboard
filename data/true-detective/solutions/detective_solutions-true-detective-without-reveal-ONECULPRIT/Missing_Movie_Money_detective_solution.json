    "full_text": "Kasey turned to her best friends just outside the door of Happy Burger. She managed not to squeal as she shared her news. “What you are about to witness is the incredibly adorable Cody Loman in action. He’s the new cashier, and he’s totally dreamy. Here, Tammy, hold my purse while I fix my hair.” “Oh no, not another one,” moaned Tammy. “And just how much older is this guy?” inquired Juliet. Kasey dismissed Tammy’s comment with a wave of her hand. “He’s just sixteen, only three years older than me. Oh, don’t look at me like that, my parents are seven years apart and they do just fine.” “Yeah, but they didn’t marry until after college,” muttered Tammy, but Kasey wasn’t going to miss her moment. “Okay, I’m ready,” declared Kasey. ”Come on you guys, you have to see him. Besides, I’m hungry, and the movie starts soon. You too Munchkin, let’s go.” Billy followed his big sister and her friends to the counter. He didn’t see anything special about this Cody, he looked like any other older boy. The girls seemed to think differently though. They did their best to flirt and act silly to keep his attention as they ordered. Kasey remembered to get a kid’s meal for her brother, and then handed over a twenty-dollar bill. Cody smiled right into Kasey’s eyes as he rattled off the numbers. Eleven fifty-eight out of twenty dollars, you get eight forty-two in change. His fingers touched her palm as he handed over the coins, and she giggled and blushed. Then he held up a folded stack of bills and counted slowly to eight as he flipped through them. He handed Kasey the bills with a wink and packed their food to go. Kasey kept her eyes on him while slipping her money into her purse, ready with a last smile for him when he delivered their meal. “You all be sure to come back now,” he encouraged them. “Don’t worry, she will,” chorused Tammy and Juliet. Kasey blushed even more, but waved daintily back at Cody as they walked out. The girls ate as they walked to the theater, talking with mouths full of burger and fries, and bursting out in laughter that threatened to spurt Diet Coke out their noses. Billy trailed slightly behind, enjoying his prize and thankful to be ignored for the time being. His peace ended just as they reached the theater. Tammy had just finished a chorus of “Cody and Kasey, sitting in a tree...” when Juliet chimed in with “Oh Cody, your buns are so toasty.” All three erupted in gales of laughter. Kasey had been drinking at that exact moment, so her eruption was more vivid by far. Fizz poured down her face and onto her favorite ruffled shirt. “Oh no! This is awful!” she gasped. “Hold this, Munchkin,” she commanded, thrusting her purse into Billy’s arms. Then she ran off to the theater’s restroom. The usher raised an eyebrow, but decided not to stop her. Kasey’s friends couldn’t help but keep snickering at him while they waited in the lobby for her return. Billy did his best to look like he wasn’t carrying a girl’s purse. Seeing one of his friends enter the theater, he quickly passed the purse over to Juliet so his friends would not see him holding a purse. When Kasey finally came back, she was composed and only slightly damp. Juliet handed back the purse, and Billy stood as far from his sister as he dared – not taking any chances she’d give it to him again. “All right ladies,” Juliet began, “tonight we have the choice of mermaids romancing lifeguards, government conspiracies, or flesh-crazed zombies. What’s it going to be? Step right up and cast your vote. You too, Shorty.” Kasey protested. “Munchkins only vote in the case of a tie.” It didn’t make a difference. Four votes were cast, and the decision was unanimous – flesh-crazed zombies it would be. They stepped over to the ticket counter and announced their decision. “Seven dollars each,” came the reply. The girls dove into their purses, digging through lipstick and photos, key chains, cell phones and bubblegum to find their funds. Kasey found her change but soon sounded a cry of outrage. “Where’s the rest of my money?” “What’s wrong, Kasey?” asked Tammy, concerned for her friend. Juliet looked worried too. “I only have half my money. I’m missing four dollars.” “Oh no,” said Tammy, “you didn’t drop it somewhere did you?” “How could I drop only half of my money? It was all folded together.” After another moment of thought, she declared “Someone must have stolen it!” Juliet spoke up. “Don’t go overboard, who would want to steal your money?” “Well…” Kasey looked for a likely suspect. “Each of you held my purse for a while tonight. Someone swiped my money while they were holding my purse. Each of you needs to show me your money so I can figure out who took it.” Billy got mad and yelled back in his high-pitched voice. “I didn’t take your stupid money, and I hate your ugly purse!” Kasey didn’t believe him, of course. “Let’s see in your pockets then.” Glaring at her, Billy turned out his pockets. Some green paper was revealed, he spread it out to show that it was a ten dollar bill. “Where did you get that?” snapped Kasey. “Mom gave it to me, she didn’t think you’d remember to save enough to buy me a ticket.” Kasey opened her mouth to respond, but stopped – realizing that she had indeed forgotten, even if she hadn’t lost four bucks. Juliet sighed. “Honestly Kasey, you aren’t going to have many friends left if you keep up like this. I only touched your purse for a moment tonight. The only way that I could have your money would be if I had teamed up with Billy and he had slipped me your money. And you know I don’t like the Munchkin.” Kasey was still suspicious. “Okay then, prove it.” “Well, all right…” Juliet walked over to Billy and punched him in the arm. “OW!” yelled Billy, and tried to kick her back. She stepped back and stared him down, so he settled for nursing his wound. Kasey was not amused. “That wasn’t what I meant. Show me your money.” “Oh, honestly.” Juliet had a five and two ones, just enough for the movie. As Kasey turned to Tammy, Tammy asked again, “You want to accuse your best pal of theft? I’m hurt. Are you sure you didn’t lose it?” Meanwhile she held out her money, which was seven singles.” Before Kasey could yell at Tammy, Juliet stepped in. “No, she didn’t lose it, and I know who did take it.” Kasey stared at her, expectantly. “All right, I’ll tell you, but you have to stop acting like a freak.” Kasey nodded humbly. With everyone waiting and listening to her, Juliet explained.",

List them here:\n\n<SUSPECTS>\n<names(s) for all suspects here, comma separated>\n</SUSPECTS>\n\nWho is the culprit?  There is only one. If possible, include first and last names, as well as any aliases.

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. How much money should Kasey have received?  \n   Her food cost $11.58 and she paid with a $20 bill, so her correct change was $8.42.\n\n2. When, exactly, did anyone except Kasey touch her money?  \n   • Cody, the cashier, handled it while giving the change.  \n   • No one else ever took the bills out of the purse; they only carried the purse for a short time.  \n   • Nobody opened the purse or had a chance to sort through it in public view.\n\n3. What is missing?  \n   Kasey later finds only $4 in bills and the 42¢ in coins.  The loss is precisely $4—­half of what she expected.\n\n4. Did any of the three friends suddenly acquire $4?  \n   • Billy shows one ten-dollar bill (exactly what he says his mother gave him).  \n   • Juliet has $7 (a five and two ones).  \n   • Tammy has $7 in singles.  \n   No one is “up” four extra dollars.\n\n5. Could one of them have hidden four ones elsewhere?  \n   Possible, but they were searched only seconds after handling the purse, in the middle of a cinema lobby.  Juliet would not risk planting money on herself and then volunteering to be searched.\n\n6. Who had a clear method AND motive?  \n   Cody Loman, the dreamy cashier.  He had both the chance and an obvious technique: the classic short-change swindle.  By folding the bills in half and rhythmically “counting to eight,” he could pass four one-dollar bills off as eight.  Kasey, thoroughly distracted by his smile and flirtation, never checked.\n\n7. Why does Juliet realize this first?  \n   Juliet recalls that Cody’s stack looked too thin for eight separate bills and sees that no one in their group has $4 too much.  Therefore the money was never in the purse to begin with.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCody Loman, Billy (the “Munchkin”), Juliet, Tammy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCody Loman\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhile ringing up the food, Cody Loman deliberately short-changed Kasey.  \nHe placed four one-dollar bills together, folded them, and with a bit of skilful finger work counted “one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight,” touching the same bills twice so they looked like eight separate notes.  Kasey, dazzled by his flirting, dropped the coins and the apparently “eight” bills straight into her purse without checking.  \n\nLater, when she needed $7 for her movie ticket, she found only four one-dollar bills and the 42¢ in coins.  Believing she once had eight dollars, she assumed someone had stolen half while holding her purse.  Juliet, however, noticed that nobody possessed an unexpected extra $4 and remembered the flimsy, folded wad Cody had flashed.  She deduced that the cashier, not any of them, had skimmed the money before it ever reached the purse.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nBilly: He shows a single ten-dollar bill—exactly what he says his mother gave him.  He is not “up” four dollars, and he had no opportunity to open the purse without being seen.\n\nJuliet: She has only $7, the precise sum she planned for her own ticket.  If she had stolen $4 she would now have $11, not seven.  Moreover, she was never near the purse long enough to rummage through it.\n\nTammy: She also has exactly $7, all in singles—no surplus $4.  When she held the purse outside Happy Burger, the change had not been given yet, so she could not possibly have taken it.\n\nThus the missing money never entered the purse at all; it stayed behind in Cody’s till.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Juliet looked worried too. “I only have half my money. I’m missing four dollars.” “Oh no,” said Tammy, “you didn’t drop it somewhere did you?” “How could I drop only half of my money? It was all folded together.” After another moment of thought, she declared “Someone must have stolen it!” Juliet spoke up. “Don’t go overboard, who would want to steal your money?” “Well…” Kasey looked for a likely suspect. “Each of you held my purse for a while tonight. Someone swiped my money while they were holding my purse. Each of you needs to show me your money so I can figure out who took it.” Billy got mad and yelled back in his high-pitched voice. “I didn’t take your stupid money, and I hate your ugly purse!” Kasey didn’t believe him, of course. “Let’s see in your pockets then.” Glaring at her, Billy turned out his pockets. Some green paper was revealed, he spread it out to show that it was a ten dollar bill. “Where did you get that?” snapped Kasey. “Mom gave it to me, she didn’t think you’d remember to save enough to buy me a ticket.” Kasey opened her mouth to respond, but stopped – realizing that she had indeed forgotten, even if she hadn’t lost four bucks. Juliet sighed. “Honestly Kasey, you aren’t going to have many friends left if you keep up like this. I only touched your purse for a moment tonight. The only way that I could have your money would be if I had teamed up with Billy and he had slipped me your money. And you know I don’t like the Munchkin.” Kasey was still suspicious. “Okay then, prove it.” “Well, all right…” Juliet walked over to Billy and punched him in the arm. “OW!” yelled Billy, and tried to kick her back. She stepped back and stared him down, so he settled for nursing his wound. Kasey was not amused. “That wasn’t what I meant. Show me your money.” “Oh, honestly.” Juliet had a five and two ones, just enough for the movie. As Kasey turned to Tammy, Tammy asked again, “You want to accuse your best pal of theft? I’m hurt. Are you sure you didn’t lose it?” Meanwhile she held out her money, which was seven singles.” Before Kasey could yell at Tammy, Juliet stepped in. “No, she didn’t lose it, and I know who did take it.” Kasey stared at her, expectantly. “All right, I’ll tell you, but you have to stop acting like a freak.” Kasey nodded humbly. With everyone waiting and listening to her, Juliet explained.",

      "outcome": "“While each of us touched your purse, that does not mean that we each had a chance to take your money. Even if Tammy has seven singles, unless Tammy can travel in time, I don’t see how she could have taken your change before you even got it.”\n“Next is the Munchkin. Since he only has a ten-dollar bill, he obviously does not have your four singles. Likewise, I only have a five and two-ones, so I did not take it. We’ve settled that none of us took your money, and that you didn’t lose it, right? Then that leaves just one other person who touched your money tonight.”\nKasey still looked blank, so Juliet continued.\n“Hand me your money please – and don’t worry, I’ll give it right back to you.”\nHesitantly, Kasey gave her the four bills.\nJuliet demonstrated carefully, first folding the stack of bills in half, then counting down the ends one by one. “One – two – three – four – five – six – seven – eight. Here’s your eight dollars, ma’am.”\nKasey gasped as she took the money back. “Cody!” she shouted. “He distracted me with his charm while he stole my money!”\nTammy and Juliet both rolled their eyes, but nodded in agreement. The four hurried back to Happy Burger, and found Cody’s manager. He fired the unfortunate thief, gave Kasey her four dollars back, and offered them all complimentary drinks as an apology.\nThey made it back to the theater in record time, missing only most of the previews, and when the flesh-crazed zombies turned out to be uproariously funny, they all wound up laughing Coke out their noses. Except for Billy that is – he fell asleep."
