    "full_text": "Katie Johnson and Alicia Cates were best friends. The women were genuinely fond of one another, and their friendship had an added benefit: The Cates and Johnson families lived next door to each other, and so the two mothers often teamed up when working with the children and their various church and school activities. One sunny day in early spring, the moms planned a fun outing for the five kids. Katie had two girls, Emilee and Olivia, ages nine and three, respectively. Alicia had two boys and one girl: Trevor was the oldest at age six, followed by four-year-old Justin and two-year-old Brianna. Since school was out for Emilee, Katie and Alicia promised the kids a trip to the candy store at the mall. Darby’s Confectionary was not just any candy store. It was huge, with lots of floor space divided into sections that carried just about every type of sweets in existence. It even had an “Old Time Candy” department which Katie’s husband Carl loved to frequent. In fact, Katie planned to purchase a couple of packages of Sixties-era clove flavored chewing gum for him while she, Alicia and the kids visited the store. Around mid-morning, everyone piled into the Johnson SUV and headed toward the mall and Darby’s Confectionary. The children were excited, even though Katie and Alicia had set a firm rule: No candy until after lunch. They were going to the Confectionary to purchase only, and would need to save the treats for later in the afternoon. The mothers were agile young women, very quick on their feet—they needed to be when in the candy store with the children. As soon as the pleasant smell of sweets hit their little noses, the kids quickly began to spread out to explore. Katie and Alicia weren’t worried; they knew from previous experience that this was not as much of a problem as it seemed. The store was well-lit with wide aisles, and most of the candy was either behind counters or stored high enough that young children could not reach it. Besides, they had been clear about their rules for this outing, and they trusted their little ones to be respectful. The moms took their time going to the gum counter to make Katie’s purchase for Carl. Livvie, Katie’s three-year-old, went with them. Livvie had a nasty head cold and didn’t feel well, but Katie knew that missing a trip to the Confectionary would break the little girl’s heart. Livvie had suffered from the cold for several days and her mother hoped that getting out of the house and breathing some fresh air would make her feel better and restore her appetite. Emilee had offered to walk Brianna around the store, but being a typical two-year-old, Brianna became distracted by the section of the store where the brownies and cookies were displayed. These items were baked fresh every morning and kept in a glass case with a slide door and a low key lock in the back. Emilee had been distracted herself, looking at the hard candy, imagining they way they’d melt in her mouth. Before noticing that Brianna had wandered off, she considered asking her mom to buy a few ounces of heart-shaped mints. Mr. Darby was working in the hard candy section and asked her if she would like a sample. Emilee was tempted but replied that no, she had better not, as her mother would not like it if she found out. Mr. Darby grinned and told her to her to bring her mother over to see him before leaving and he would give her a small sample to take home. Emilee saw that Brianna had wandered off, and she quickly found her a couple of aisles over, staring at the blonde brownies and chocolate chip cookies. Brianna’s plump little fingers smudged the glass as she pointed out to Emilee the delicious-looking sweets. After grabbing a few packs of Carl’s favorite clove gum and visiting with the woman staffing the Old Time Candy department for a few minutes, the women found Trevor in the licorice section. There was licorice of all flavors and colors displayed but Alicia though it odd that her son would be looking in this area, for he had recently lost a tooth when falling off his bicycle and chewing was very painful. Katie, Alicia, and Trevor then met the girls in the bakery section. Emilee told her mom about her conversation with Mr. Darby, and Katie thanked her for following the no candy until after lunch rule. The last child they rounded up was Justin. Justin was a typical four-year-old boy who had gravitated to the messiest area of the store, the soft chocolate section. The section was partially roped off, as Mr. Darby was remodeling a display on a side wall and had left a step stool, paint drop cloth and some loose pieces of wood on the floor. Mr. Darby kept candy bars and chocolate drops in this area, but they were up just high enough that a small child could not get to them. After rounding up Justin and making several purchases, the moms and kids prepared to leave. They approached Mr. Darby, who was still behind the hard candy counter. “Good, you’ve come back for your free sample,” he said to Emilee, smiling. He looked at the young mothers. “But one of my clerks tells me that somebody had a snack they forgot to pay for.” Alicia and Katie spoke with the children for a few minutes, but none of them admitted to anything. Finally, Alicia said to Mr. Darby, “I know who the guilty party is without you having to tell me!”",

The logical deduction from the clues presented\n\nSolve the mystery. Write down your thought process here.\n\n<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n<thought process here>\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\nWho are the possible suspects? List them here:\n\n<SUSPECTS>\n<names(s) for all suspects here, comma separated>\n</SUSPECTS>\n\nWho is the culprit?  There is only one. If possible, include first and last names, as well as any aliases. Answer in the form:\n\n<CULPRIT>\n<name here>\n</CULPRIT>\n\nNow write down your reconstruction of the events of what actually happened.\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n<event reconstruction here>\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\nFinally, explain why the other suspects are innocent.\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n<explanation here>\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe clerk has definitely seen someone EAT something that had not yet been paid for.  \nThat means (a) the article had to be located in a part of the store where it was easy to reach and open, and (b) the act was visible enough for a clerk to notice.  \nWhile the five children certainly WANTED candy, every description of the store layout shows the goodies they were interested in were either (1) locked inside the bakery case, (2) behind counters, or (3) stored so high that “a small child could not reach it.”  In other words, none of the youngsters could easily get at any candy without attracting immediate attention.\n\nWho, then, *could* reach something, open it, and pop it into the mouth?  Only one of the seven visitors was actually handling merchandise that is ordinarily eaten immediately after the wrapper is removed—Katie Johnson, who had just picked up several packets of her husband Carl’s favourite clove-flavoured chewing-gum in the Old-Time-Candy department.\n\nBecause Katie and Alicia stayed chatting with the clerk there for “a few minutes,” Katie had ample time to tear the wrapper off one stick, slip it into her mouth, and start chewing while the conversation continued.  She had not yet paid for her shopping, so—technically—she was eating unpaid merchandise.  A clerk watching from a distance would quite naturally report that “somebody had a snack they forgot to pay for.”\n\nWhy was Alicia able to announce the culprit instantly?  Clove gum has an unmistakable, pungent aroma.  As soon as Mr Darby mentioned the unpaid snack Alicia could *smell* the clove on her friend’s breath and realise that Katie must have absent-mindedly helped herself to a piece while they were chatting.\n\nTherefore the guilty party is not one of the children at all, but the adult who had gum in her hand, the only edible item anyone in the party had easy access to.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nKatie Johnson, Alicia Cates, Emilee Johnson, Olivia “Livvie” Johnson, Trevor Cates, Justin Cates, Brianna Cates\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nKatie Johnson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. The group enters Darby’s Confectionary.  \n2. In the Old-Time-Candy department Katie picks up several packs of clove chewing-gum for her husband.  \n3. While she and Alicia chat with the sales-clerk, Katie absent-mindedly opens one of the packs, slips a stick of gum into her mouth and starts chewing.  \n4. A store clerk notices that a member of the party is eating unpaid merchandise and reports it to Mr Darby.  \n5. When the family return to the hard-candy counter, Mr Darby tells them one of them has been snacking.  \n6. The distinctive scent of clove gum is now obvious.  Alicia instantly recognises it and realises that her friend must have opened the gum before paying.  \n7. Alicia therefore tells Mr Darby she already knows who the guilty party is—Katie Johnson.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Emilee (9) – All the hard candy she examined was behind Mr Darby’s counter.  She never touched any and even refused a sample.  \n• Trevor (6) – A lost tooth made chewing painful; he was only *looking* at the licorice and had no reason to start eating it.  \n• Justin (4) – In the roped-off chocolate area the candy was purposely set too high for a small child to reach; no evidence of chocolate on him is mentioned.  \n• Brianna (2) – The brownies and cookies she stared at were locked inside a glass case she could not open.  \n• Olivia (3) – Stayed with the mothers the whole time and was nursing a head-cold, with little appetite.  \n• Alicia Cates – She handled no edible merchandise in the story.  \nOnly Katie Johnson both possessed something edible and had the opportunity to put it in her mouth without paying first, and the clerk’s wording matches precisely that situation.  Hence she—and she alone—is the culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
