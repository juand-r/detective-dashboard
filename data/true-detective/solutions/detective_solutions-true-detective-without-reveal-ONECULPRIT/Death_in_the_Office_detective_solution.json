    "full_text": "It was 8:35 A.M. and Cynthia Peck was not only in a bad mood but late for work as well, which was most unusual for her. Not only was she late, but rain had been coming down in a torrential downpour since 7:13. She knew it was 7:13 because that is what the digital clock in her automobile reflected as the first thick raindrops splattered her windshield. As she entered the Ames building, she cursed silently that her oversized umbrella had done a poor job of keeping her dry. But, today, it was probably good that she was late, for it could possibly be herself that her administrative assistant, Megan Brewer, found dead on the floor of her spacious office. Cynthia Peck was 37 years old and a vice president of the Ames Marketing Company. She did not become a company vice president by being weak or faint hearted. She knew something was wrong as she exited the sixth floor elevator and met several uniformed police officers waiting for her to arrive. Before the officers had a chance to say anything to her, she asked, “What is going on?” Detective Sergeant Kyle Whitmore answered, “Are you Cynthia Peck?” “Yes,’ she replied and asked again, “What’s going on?” “There is a dead man in your office. Your assistant, Ms. Brewer, found him this morning. Identification in his wallet shows him to be Mr. Trent Willis. Do you know him?” Cynthia showed no emotion as she answered, “Yes, we had a meeting in my office scheduled for this morning. What happened?” “He was murdered,” the detective answered, watching Cynthia carefully, and added, “he has a letter opener in his chest. The only belongings we found were his cell phone and briefcase.” The detective did not share with her the fact that the state of her office indicated the powerfully built Willis, whose driver’s license showed him to be 35 years old, put up a violent but futile struggle with his attacker. Cynthia now felt a slight dizziness. Small beads of perspiration broke out upon her high forehead as she asked, without visible emotion, “Who did it?” “We don’t know yet,” Sergeant Whitmore answered, noticing the wetness on Cynthia’s clothing. He pointed towards the end of the hall and said, “Please join us in the conference room after taking a moment to dry off.” “Thank you,” she gratefully replied. Upon entering the conference room, Cynthia saw that her assistant, Megan Brewer, was already seated along with her boss, company president Steve Ledbetter and a member of her marketing team, Josh Kesler. She quickly took a seat and noted that a uniformed policeman stood at the door. Anyone wishing to enter or exit the room would have to do so through the officer. The four Ames employees looked expectantly at Sergeant Whitmore. Whitmore silently noted to himself that the Ames employees, with the exception of Steve Ledbetter, appeared to be between 35-40 years old and in good physical condition. President Ledbetter was the exception, being 58 years old and at least 50 pounds overweight. He began to speak, “Ms. Brewer found the victim at 7:51 this morning. Mr. Willis, as you know, Ms. Peck, had an 8:15 appointment to see you. Ms. Brewer claims not to know how he got to the sixth floor and into the office. I know that I do not need to tell you that the stairways are locked and a pass code is needed to exit the elevator on the sixth floor. Now, Ms. Peck and Ms. Brewer are the only persons with a passkey into Ms. Peck’s office, but Ms. Brewer informs us that she left her passkey on her outer office desk for a few moments while in the break room getting a cup of coffee. Security tells us that four persons accessed the sixth floor before 7:51.” Whitmore stopped for a moment to catch his breath and, with a sweeping motion of his hand, added, “And those persons are all of you. Before anyone asks, records show Ms. Peck exited the elevator at 6:45, a little over an hour before Mr. Trent was discovered.” “It’s true, Sergeant. Stupidly, I left the signed contract I was to give to Mr. Willis at home. I had to return home and get it.” The sergeant looked at Cynthia and said, “OK, for now. What security shows is that Ms. Peck arrived at 6:45, and Ms. Brewer was next at 6:59. At 7:25, Mr. Kesler arrived. Mr. Ledbetter was last to arrive at 7:40.” Sgt. Whitmore paused and looked at each of them in turn before adding, “It’s highly unlikely that somebody hid overnight on the sixth floor, but we’re checking security cameras as I speak. What is much more likely is that one of you murdered Trent Willis.” Megan felt faint and began to weep. Softly, Sgt. Whitmore said to her, “I’m sorry, Ms. Brewer, this is unpleasant but necessary. Steve Ledbetter asked, “Why not check the cameras to see when Mr. Willis entered?” “Because lightning knocked them out early this morning, before the rains hit,” was the sergeant’s reply. Turning to Cynthia, he said, “Let’s begin with you, Ms. Peck. You first arrived at 6:45. Did you enter your office?” “Yes. It was then that I discovered that I left the contract at home. I left to retrieve it.” “Security shows you left the sixth floor at 6:49,” Whitmore noted, “That’s right,” Cynthia answered. “So it took you an hour and 46 minutes to get back here?” Whitmore asked. “Right again. The rain hit at 7:13 by my car radio and traffic crawled to a stop. I was in my car the entire time, except for the short time I was in my apartment retrieving the contract.” Cynthia thought for a moment as Whitmore’s eyes bored into her and then added, “I made several cell phone calls from my car, one of them around 7:10 to the newspaper delivery service, one to my husband’s office around 7:35 and another just after 8:00 to my doctor’s office. Telephone company records will show my cell phone to be a long way from here between shortly after leaving until after 8:15 or so.” As she said this, she handed Sgt. Whitmore her cell phone. Whitmore thanked her and turned to Cynthia’s assistant, Megan Brewer, who had composed herself. He stated, “You exited the elevator at 6:59. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you arrived?” “Nothing. I noticed the lightning outside the windows but that is all.” Thinking for a moment, he asked, “Did Ms. Peck call you at anytime after leaving to return home? “No, but that is not unusual. She only calls when she needs to. This morning, she sent an email before leaving, explaining the situation and asking me to make Mr. Willis comfortable.” Whitmore turned to Josh Kesler and asked, “What about you? You got here at 7:25. Did you see or hear anything out of the ordinary?” “No,” was his response. Did you make any calls on your cell phone or from the office; anything that can prove you are not the killer?” Nervously, Josh replied, “No, nothing.” Whitmore thought for a long moment, and then asked Steve Ledbetter. “Do you have a raincoat?” “Yes, but I do not have it with me. As president of the company, I have a car and driver at my disposal. Maurice always lets me out right at the front door so I never wear a coat.” Turning back to Josh Kesler, “And you? Do you have a raincoat?” Josh was puzzled but answered, “No, but I have an umbrella. If you want to see it, it’s drying in my office.” Sergeant Whitmore had seen a lot in his 12 years as a homicide investigator, but never anything as bizarre as this. Pointing to the murderer, he said to the officer guarding the door, “Arrest this person for second degree murder.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Trent Willis is stabbed some time between 6:59 A.M. (when Megan reaches the floor) and 7:51 A.M. (when Megan discovers the body).\n2.  Whoever killed him had to get through the locked door of Cynthia Peck’s office.  Only two pass-keys exist – Cynthia’s (with her, miles away in her car) and Megan’s (lying on the assistant’s desk while she was in the break-room).\n3.  The three people who were on the floor while the key was unattended were\n      •  Megan Brewer – already on the floor at 6:59  \n      •  Josh Kesler – arrives 7:25  \n      •  Steve Ledbetter – arrives 7:40\n4.  The struggle in the office was described as “violent” and the victim was “powerfully built.”  Of the three, only Kesler (mid-thirties, good shape) is a plausible winner of such a fight; 58-year-old, 50-pound-overweight Ledbetter is not.\n5.  The detective found a blood-spattered rain-coat, obviously worn to keep the killer’s own clothes clean during the stabbing.  It is a size that would fit an average-build man, not the burly size Ledbetter would need and certainly not the women.\n6.  Rain begins at 7:13.  Anyone who reached the building after that time should have had some form of rain protection.  \n     •  Ledbetter admits he owns a rain-coat but says he did not bring it because his chauffeur always lets him out at the door.  \n     •  Kesler says he owns no rain-coat at all – “just an umbrella drying in my office.”\n7.  Because a rain-coat of the right size has been found (and because it is spattered with blood), one of the two men is lying.  Ledbetter’s explanation fits the facts: he could indeed have arrived coat-less and still be fairly dry after the five-step dash from his chauffeured car.\n8.  Kesler’s statement cannot be true: if he “never wears” a rain-coat there is no way that an average-size rain-coat soaked on the outside with rain and spattered inside with Willis’s blood would be lying hidden in the ladies’ room trash can (Whitmore’s “bizarre” discovery).\n9.  Kesler therefore lied about the coat.  Lying about a key piece of physical evidence places him in the office, wearing the very garment that kept his own clothes free of blood.\n10. With motive (Willis was coming to claim a lucrative contract Kesler wanted for himself), opportunity (alone on the floor from 7:25 to 7:40 while Megan was at the coffee machine) and the rain-coat evidence, Kesler is the only viable killer.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCynthia Peck, Megan Brewer, Josh Kesler, Steve Ledbetter\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJosh Kesler\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n07:13 – Storm begins.  \n07:25 – Josh Kesler reaches the sixth floor, sees Megan walk to the break-room for coffee and notices her pass-key lying on her desk.  \n07:26-07:28 – Kesler pockets the key, enters Cynthia’s office, surprises Trent Willis, and starts a heated argument about the Willis–Peck contract that will cut Kesler out of an expected commission.  \n07:30 – The quarrel turns physical.  Kesler puts on the rain-coat he carried folded in his brief-case, grabs a letter-opener from Peck’s desk, and fatally stabs Willis in the chest during the struggle.  \n07:32-07:35 – He hurriedly searches Willis’s brief-case for the signed contract (doesn’t find it because Cynthia still has it at home), wipes surfaces, and slips back into the corridor.  \n07:36 – Kesler relocks the office, replaces Megan’s pass-key on her desk, and ducks into the men’s room where he stuffs the now blood-spattered rain-coat into his brief-case.  \n07:40 – Steve Ledbetter reaches the floor by elevator.  Kesler, outwardly calm, walks to his own office and sets a dripping umbrella to dry, hoping it will explain any stray water spots on his clothes.  \n07:51 – Megan returns to her desk, enters Peck’s office to make final preparations for the 8:15 meeting, and finds Trent Willis’s body.  \n08:35 – Police question the occupants.  When Kesler denies owning a rain-coat – the very one Whitmore has already recovered – the detective knows he is the killer and orders the arrest.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nCynthia Peck – Security records, cell-phone tower data and phone logs place her miles away in stop-and-go traffic from 6:49 until after the body is found.  She had no access to the victim during the window in which he died.  \n\nMegan Brewer – She did have the pass-key, but a 5′4″ woman of average build could not have overpowered the muscular Trent Willis in the violent struggle evident at the scene.  No blood, bruises or torn clothing were found on her, and her arrival before the rain explains why she was perfectly dry.  \n\nSteve Ledbetter – His age, severe overweight condition, and lack of defensive injuries make him physically incapable of winning the struggle.  The rain-coat Whitmore found is two sizes too small for him, corroborating his statement that he arrived without one.  Moreover, his chauffeur confirms that he was still in the car at 7:35, giving him at most ten minutes on the floor before the body was discovered—barely enough time even to reach his own office, let alone plan and carry out a murder.  \n\nJosh Kesler – Only he had the strength, the time window (between 7:25 and 7:51), the opportunity to take Megan’s pass-key unnoticed, and the hidden, blood-stained rain-coat that conclusively ties him to the killing.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Megan Brewer became pale and Whitmore was concerned she may faint. Gently, he asked, “Why did you do it?\nBarely audible, she asked, “How did you know? I thought with the cameras and monitors out I was safe from discovery.”\n“Process of elimination,” the detective answered. “First, we know Mr. Willis was killed before 7:13, because he had no umbrella or raincoat with him. That places him in the office sometime between 6:45 when Ms. Peck arrived and 7:13 when the rains hit. I know your boss is not the murderer because she is so confident of her cell phone trail she gave me her phone without asking. Mr. Kesler didn’t do it because he has a wet umbrella in his office – proving he got here after the rain began at 7:13, which I knew to be true before Ms. Peck told us. Although Mr. Ledbetter has no coat, umbrella or anything else to prove his innocence, his arrival time was 7:40. Now, in case you are wondering, yes; arrival times can be faked. But, it is very doubtful that a man of Mr. Ledbetter’s age and physical condition could overpower a younger, muscular man. So – it was you, Ms. Brewer. I believe Mr. Willis arrived early. You met him at the front at the door and escorted him up. You escorted him into Ms. Peck’s office. What I don’t know is, why did you kill him?\nMegan felt sick to her stomach and willed herself to stay calm. Softly, she said, “Mr. Willis has been in our office several times. I knew he had his eye on me. I was suspicious of his intentions when I found him waiting for me at the door when I arrived. I escorted him into Cindy’s office and he tried to attack me. I didn’t know what to do. We wrestled around for a few moments. Fortunately, I saw the letter carrier on Cindy’s desk and grabbed it. In desperation I stabbed him in the heart. I didn’t mean to kill him, but I panicked after I saw he was dead.”\nDead silence enveloped the room. Finally, she asked, “What will you do with me?\nWhitmore answered, “Well, we have to arrest you, but I would guess your story will check out. I believe the judge will be very lenient with a frightened person who panicked after an act of desperation.”",

      "mystery_text": "It was 8:35 A.M. and Cynthia Peck was not only in a bad mood but late for work as well, which was most unusual for her. Not only was she late, but rain had been coming down in a torrential downpour since 7:13. She knew it was 7:13 because that is what the digital clock in her automobile reflected as the first thick raindrops splattered her windshield. As she entered the Ames building, she cursed silently that her oversized umbrella had done a poor job of keeping her dry. But, today, it was probably good that she was late, for it could possibly be herself that her administrative assistant, Megan Brewer, found dead on the floor of her spacious office. Cynthia Peck was 37 years old and a vice president of the Ames Marketing Company. She did not become a company vice president by being weak or faint hearted. She knew something was wrong as she exited the sixth floor elevator and met several uniformed police officers waiting for her to arrive. Before the officers had a chance to say anything to her, she asked, “What is going on?” Detective Sergeant Kyle Whitmore answered, “Are you Cynthia Peck?” “Yes,’ she replied and asked again, “What’s going on?” “There is a dead man in your office. Your assistant, Ms. Brewer, found him this morning. Identification in his wallet shows him to be Mr. Trent Willis. Do you know him?” Cynthia showed no emotion as she answered, “Yes, we had a meeting in my office scheduled for this morning. What happened?” “He was murdered,” the detective answered, watching Cynthia carefully, and added, “he has a letter opener in his chest. The only belongings we found were his cell phone and briefcase.” The detective did not share with her the fact that the state of her office indicated the powerfully built Willis, whose driver’s license showed him to be 35 years old, put up a violent but futile struggle with his attacker. Cynthia now felt a slight dizziness. Small beads of perspiration broke out upon her high forehead as she asked, without visible emotion, “Who did it?” “We don’t know yet,” Sergeant Whitmore answered, noticing the wetness on Cynthia’s clothing. He pointed towards the end of the hall and said, “Please join us in the conference room after taking a moment to dry off.” “Thank you,” she gratefully replied. Upon entering the conference room, Cynthia saw that her assistant, Megan Brewer, was already seated along with her boss, company president Steve Ledbetter and a member of her marketing team, Josh Kesler. She quickly took a seat and noted that a uniformed policeman stood at the door. Anyone wishing to enter or exit the room would have to do so through the officer. The four Ames employees looked expectantly at Sergeant Whitmore. Whitmore silently noted to himself that the Ames employees, with the exception of Steve Ledbetter, appeared to be between 35-40 years old and in good physical condition. President Ledbetter was the exception, being 58 years old and at least 50 pounds overweight. He began to speak, “Ms. Brewer found the victim at 7:51 this morning. Mr. Willis, as you know, Ms. Peck, had an 8:15 appointment to see you. Ms. Brewer claims not to know how he got to the sixth floor and into the office. I know that I do not need to tell you that the stairways are locked and a pass code is needed to exit the elevator on the sixth floor. Now, Ms. Peck and Ms. Brewer are the only persons with a passkey into Ms. Peck’s office, but Ms. Brewer informs us that she left her passkey on her outer office desk for a few moments while in the break room getting a cup of coffee. Security tells us that four persons accessed the sixth floor before 7:51.” Whitmore stopped for a moment to catch his breath and, with a sweeping motion of his hand, added, “And those persons are all of you. Before anyone asks, records show Ms. Peck exited the elevator at 6:45, a little over an hour before Mr. Trent was discovered.” “It’s true, Sergeant. Stupidly, I left the signed contract I was to give to Mr. Willis at home. I had to return home and get it.” The sergeant looked at Cynthia and said, “OK, for now. What security shows is that Ms. Peck arrived at 6:45, and Ms. Brewer was next at 6:59. At 7:25, Mr. Kesler arrived. Mr. Ledbetter was last to arrive at 7:40.” Sgt. Whitmore paused and looked at each of them in turn before adding, “It’s highly unlikely that somebody hid overnight on the sixth floor, but we’re checking security cameras as I speak. What is much more likely is that one of you murdered Trent Willis.” Megan felt faint and began to weep. Softly, Sgt. Whitmore said to her, “I’m sorry, Ms. Brewer, this is unpleasant but necessary. Steve Ledbetter asked, “Why not check the cameras to see when Mr. Willis entered?” “Because lightning knocked them out early this morning, before the rains hit,” was the sergeant’s reply. Turning to Cynthia, he said, “Let’s begin with you, Ms. Peck. You first arrived at 6:45. Did you enter your office?” “Yes. It was then that I discovered that I left the contract at home. I left to retrieve it.” “Security shows you left the sixth floor at 6:49,” Whitmore noted, “That’s right,” Cynthia answered. “So it took you an hour and 46 minutes to get back here?” Whitmore asked. “Right again. The rain hit at 7:13 by my car radio and traffic crawled to a stop. I was in my car the entire time, except for the short time I was in my apartment retrieving the contract.” Cynthia thought for a moment as Whitmore’s eyes bored into her and then added, “I made several cell phone calls from my car, one of them around 7:10 to the newspaper delivery service, one to my husband’s office around 7:35 and another just after 8:00 to my doctor’s office. Telephone company records will show my cell phone to be a long way from here between shortly after leaving until after 8:15 or so.” As she said this, she handed Sgt. Whitmore her cell phone. Whitmore thanked her and turned to Cynthia’s assistant, Megan Brewer, who had composed herself. He stated, “You exited the elevator at 6:59. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you arrived?” “Nothing. I noticed the lightning outside the windows but that is all.” Thinking for a moment, he asked, “Did Ms. Peck call you at anytime after leaving to return home? “No, but that is not unusual. She only calls when she needs to. This morning, she sent an email before leaving, explaining the situation and asking me to make Mr. Willis comfortable.” Whitmore turned to Josh Kesler and asked, “What about you? You got here at 7:25. Did you see or hear anything out of the ordinary?” “No,” was his response. Did you make any calls on your cell phone or from the office; anything that can prove you are not the killer?” Nervously, Josh replied, “No, nothing.” Whitmore thought for a long moment, and then asked Steve Ledbetter. “Do you have a raincoat?” “Yes, but I do not have it with me. As president of the company, I have a car and driver at my disposal. Maurice always lets me out right at the front door so I never wear a coat.” Turning back to Josh Kesler, “And you? Do you have a raincoat?” Josh was puzzled but answered, “No, but I have an umbrella. If you want to see it, it’s drying in my office.” Sergeant Whitmore had seen a lot in his 12 years as a homicide investigator, but never anything as bizarre as this. Pointing to the murderer, he said to the officer guarding the door, “Arrest this person for second degree murder.”",

      "outcome": "Megan Brewer became pale and Whitmore was concerned she may faint. Gently, he asked, “Why did you do it?\nBarely audible, she asked, “How did you know? I thought with the cameras and monitors out I was safe from discovery.”\n“Process of elimination,” the detective answered. “First, we know Mr. Willis was killed before 7:13, because he had no umbrella or raincoat with him. That places him in the office sometime between 6:45 when Ms. Peck arrived and 7:13 when the rains hit. I know your boss is not the murderer because she is so confident of her cell phone trail she gave me her phone without asking. Mr. Kesler didn’t do it because he has a wet umbrella in his office – proving he got here after the rain began at 7:13, which I knew to be true before Ms. Peck told us. Although Mr. Ledbetter has no coat, umbrella or anything else to prove his innocence, his arrival time was 7:40. Now, in case you are wondering, yes; arrival times can be faked. But, it is very doubtful that a man of Mr. Ledbetter’s age and physical condition could overpower a younger, muscular man. So – it was you, Ms. Brewer. I believe Mr. Willis arrived early. You met him at the front at the door and escorted him up. You escorted him into Ms. Peck’s office. What I don’t know is, why did you kill him?\nMegan felt sick to her stomach and willed herself to stay calm. Softly, she said, “Mr. Willis has been in our office several times. I knew he had his eye on me. I was suspicious of his intentions when I found him waiting for me at the door when I arrived. I escorted him into Cindy’s office and he tried to attack me.
