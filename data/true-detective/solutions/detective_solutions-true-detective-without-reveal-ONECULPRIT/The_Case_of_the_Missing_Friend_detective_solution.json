    "full_text": "Thursday night, November 21, 1963. The weather was mild in Oklahoma City and the five friends gathered in the small apartment of Steve Collier to study for tomorrow’s upcoming exams. They were all college students and not only were there tests to be taken tomorrow, the holiday season and final exams were creeping nearer and nearer. The evening was uneventful. All of them were seniors and had been friends for many years. Billy and Susan had dated for a while a couple of years ago but had broken up amicably and remained friends. Tonight was study night; tomorrow would be Friday night and time for weekend partying. Harrell left for home first, around 9:30. Harrell lived north of town and liked a good night’s sleep before test taking. Since he lived with his parents, Harrell used Steve’s telephone to call and tell his parents, he was on the way. It usually took about 20 minutes for him to drive from Steve’s apartment in near north Oklahoma City to his home farther out north. Billy and Susan left next, at 9:50. The campus was a couple miles from Steve’s apartment and occasionally Susan would walk back to her room when the weather was nice and if it was not too late, for curfew was at 11:00 and, after that, nobody could come in or out of the building until next morning. However, tonight she was tired and she gratefully accepted Billy’s offer of a ride. When he drove her home, Billy would escort her into the building reception desk, and then drive to his home in south Oklahoma City. However, he was a little farther out and the roads were rougher and darker than those Harrell traveled when returning home from Steve’s. In fact, several times Billy’s father called Steve when Billy was late in getting home. Diana was the last to leave, but it was not until almost 11:00. Diana lived with her parents, closer to Steve’s apartment than Billy or Harrell. Ever since she was a little girl, Diana loved to travel the dirt road around the east side of the lake when returning home. A very petite young woman, normally she very comfortably drove a Volkswagen but tonight she was in her father’s Cadillac and felt older than her 22 years, for a Cadillac was an “old people’s car”. Normally, Diana was not able to use her Dad’s car, but since her parents were on vacation till Friday, she was able to upgrade to the much bigger Cadillac. After Diana departed, Steve did what little cleaning up was needed and went to bed. Little did he know then that tomorrow, one of his friends would be missing. In large part because of the tragic events in Dallas, which were now a little more than 12 hours away, nobody would be certain what happened until after President Kennedy’s funeral. The next day, what would become known as the “Crime of the Century” happened at approximately 12:30 P.M. Oklahoma time, or CST, Central Standard Time, By 1:00 P.M. President Kennedy was pronounced dead and 75 million Americans would know of the shooting. That afternoon, overloaded telephone systems were breaking down all over the country and there were roadblocks as far north as Tulsa in Oklahoma, just in case Lee Harvey Oswald had not worked alone in murdering the president. The case of Steve Collier’s missing friend simply slipped through the cracks, for nobody knew for certain there was a disappearance until after the shooting in Dallas’ Dealey Plaza. The missing person’s family did not decide to notify the authorities until around noon as the missing student was an adult who had spent the night out unannounced before. When they attempted to place the call at a little after one they could not get through. They were not able to get through to the police department switchboard until early Friday evening. By then, police forces all over the country were dealing with a possible national security issue – maybe even the cold war with the USSR was heating up to a live one. A harried and overworked local police force could only do so much. So, Steve would not learn of his missing friend until Tuesday the 26th. Normally, news of a missing person would be all over the news in Oklahoma City, still a small town at heart in 1963. But, the shock of Friday night and Saturday had not worn off when Oswald himself was murdered late Sunday morning by Jack Ruby on national television at 11:21 A.M. CST. President Kennedy’s funeral was the next day, Monday, so there was no resemblance of anything normal until Tuesday morning. Steve, as did most Americans during that long nightmarish weekend, sat glued to his television set, scarcely aware of other events going on in the world, such as the tragic fire on Saturday at the Golden Age Nursing home in Fitchville, Ohio, which killed 63 of the 84 residents. Indeed, the streets of Oklahoma City were almost entirely devoid of traffic until after the president’s funeral. For three days, Oklahoma City resembled a ghost town to those few who were out and about. But, finally, on Tuesday a sad and sorrowful nation went back to work. Steve’s already overloaded senses were given another shock when Oklahoma City Police Lieutenant Rick Petit knocked on his apartment door early Tuesday afternoon. Steve had attended class that morning and had heard nothing concerning anyone being missing. After Lieutenant Petit explained his friend’s disappearance after leaving the apartment Thursday evening and his knowledge of the Thursday evening study session, Steve fought through the emotional numbness he felt, thought for a few moments and said to the officer, “I know who is missing without you having to tell me.”",

    "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. The detective first has to discover WHICH of the four guests failed to reach home.  \n   • Harrell’s parents expected him 20‒25 min after his 9 : 30 call.  Had he not appeared they would have been alarmed long before noon Friday and the switchboard jam.  \n   • If Billy were the missing one his father – who habitually rang Steve whenever Billy was late – would have been on the telephone before day-break Friday.  \n   • Susan lived in a women’s dorm that locked at 11 p.m.  If she had not returned, the college would have alerted the dean and the police during the night of the 21st.  \n   • Only Diana’s absence could have remained unnoticed until “around noon” Friday: her parents were out of town and were not due back until then.  \n   Therefore Steve could tell Lt. Petit at once that the missing friend had to be DIANA.\n\n2. Was a crime actually committed?  Look at Diana’s circumstances.  \n   • She left alone, almost exactly 11 p.m., in her father’s huge Cadillac – a car she rarely drove.  \n   • She insisted on taking the un-lit dirt track round the east side of the lake.  That track runs only a few metres from the water in places and has no guard-rail.  \n   • It had been dry and “mild”, so there were no fresh tyre marks or gouges to betray what had happened; a 1962 Cadillac will float just long enough to slide away from shore before sinking.  \n   • Nothing in the story puts any of the other students on that road at the right time, and none of them had either a motive or the possibility of intercepting her without drawing attention.\n\n3. The most economical explanation is therefore an accident: Diana mis-judged the unfamiliar car on the dark dirt curve, the Cadillac left the track and went into the lake.  In that case the only “culprit” is Diana herself (or, if you prefer, her inexperience combined with the heavy car).\n\n4. Because the lake lay outside the city limits and the nation’s attention was fixed on Dallas, nobody began dragging the water until several days later; the car – with Diana inside – would not be discovered until the smell of gasoline or a chance fisherman led searchers to it.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSteve Collier, Harrell (-surname not given), Billy (-surname not given), Susan (-surname not given), Diana (-surname not given), Unknown stranger/driver\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDiana herself – her own inexperience with the large Cadillac caused a fatal accident\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n23 : 00 Thursday 21 Nov 1963 – Diana leaves Steve’s flat in her father’s Cadillac, determined (as always) to take the dirt track round the east shore of the lake.  \n≈23 : 10–23 : 15 – On a bend she meets rough ruts, over-corrects, the heavy Cadillac slides off the embankment and into the lake.  The car drifts a few metres from the bank, settles, and sinks in several metres of water; it is invisible from the road at night.  \nFriday 22 Nov – Her parents return from their trip about noon, find no sign of her, try to phone the police at 13 : 00 but hit the assassination-related overload.  They finally reach the police early Friday evening.  \nWeekend 23-25 Nov – With the whole country paralysed by the Kennedy tragedy, the under-staffed Oklahoma City police can do little more than take a report.  \nTuesday 26 Nov – Once normal duties resume, Lt. Petit starts by talking to the last person known to have seen Diana, Steve Collier.  Because hers was the only disappearance that would not have been noticed until noon Friday, Steve immediately realises Diana must be the missing friend.  \nSome days later – A drag-line or fisherman locates the Cadillac; the coroner rules accidental drowning.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSteve had no time to catch Diana; she was already ten minutes away when he finished tidying up, and he had no known motive.  \nHarrell was driving north and reached home before Diana even set out; moreover, his absence would have been discovered long before noon Friday.  \nBilly had to escort Susan, then drive south; he neither shared Diana’s route nor had time to lie in wait.  \nSusan was locked inside her dorm before 11 and could not leave again until morning.  \nThere is no evidence of any unknown attacker on that deserted back road; tyre marks or footprints would have remained in soft dirt had a second vehicle forced the Cadillac off the track.  \nIn short, the disappearance was not a homicide at all – simply an unfortunate one-car accident caused by the driver, Diana, who therefore is the only “culprit”.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

    "reveal_text": "Lieutenant Petit, who had slept little since Thursday evening, numbly replied, “Excuse me?”\nSteve looked at the lieutenant and said, gently, “Well, excuse me, Lieutenant. I know you probably don’t know as much about this as you would if the president had not been shot.”\n“That’s safe to say,” Petit replied, dryly.\n“Then let me explain. It’s easier to tell you who is not missing. I know that it cannot be Susan, even though I did not see her since Thursday night. Not only did Billy take her back to her dorm, but word of her not returning would have been all over campus this morning, which it wasn’t.”\nPetit nodded his head, not mentioning that Susan Allen was properly logged back in Thursday evening at the dormitory reception desk and that she stayed in her room all weekend, still in grief and shock over the slain president.\nSteve continued, “It couldn’t have been Billy either. If Billy had not returned home, his worry-wart dad would have called me. He’s done it before.”\nAgain, Petit nodded, but he was nodding in such a way as not to confirm or deny what Steve was saying. Petit knew that Billy Friend was another of the group who stayed away from class since Friday.\n“Harrell had to have made it home. I know that is where he was heading because he called his parents before leaving. Since his parents were home, they would have reported him missing.\nPetit said, evenly, “So, you know it was Diana Scott who is missing.”\n“Yes, it’s got to be her. I suppose you know that she was in her dad’s car Thursday night.” Steve shuddered, “She always drives home around Lake Hefner. She is a short girl and Mr. Scott’s Caddy is huge. I bet she lost control on that dark and bumpy lake road.” More importantly, her parents were on vacation, so they would not have been there to report her missing.\nAFTERWARD\nWednesday morning, November 27. Mr. Scott’s Cadillac was hoisted out of a shallow inlet by the lake road running alongside. Diana’s dead body was slumped against the steering wheel. Apparently, she had been knocked unconscious when hitting the water. Lieutenant Petit was both saddened and relieved to find the body; relieved because this completed the search for Diana Scott before the Thanksgiving weekend began, saddened because he would have to inform her parents of the bad news and ruin their holiday.\nPetit noticed that the Cadillac’s dashboard clock was stopped at 11:10, fitting perfectly with what Steve Collier had told him. He would think often in the years to come that young Miss Petit died less than an hour before that fateful day of November 22, 1963, commenced at midnight.\n\nNOTE: While this story is a work of fiction, much of it is taken from a little known occurrence in Oklahoma City. On the evening of Thursday, November 21, 1963, a woman and her daughter left the home of friends to return to their home approximately five miles away. They were never seen or heard of again, until in the spring of 1990, when a small inlet off of Lake Hefner was drained and filled for an interstate highway project. The car and remains of the missing women were found in the lakebed, the dashboard clock indicating they had driven into the lake in late evening. The local police departments admitted that, had they not been so preoccupied with the Kennedy murder the next day, 200 miles south in Dallas, they would probably have been discovered the missing women much earlier. Known as the Elston case, this was, at the time of discovery, the oldest open case in the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation.",

Not only did Billy take her back to her dorm, but word of her not returning would have been all over campus this morning, which it wasn’t.”\nPetit nodded his head, not mentioning that Susan Allen was properly logged back in Thursday evening at the dormitory reception desk and that she stayed in her room all weekend, still in grief and shock over the slain president.\nSteve continued, “It couldn’t have been Billy either. If Billy had not returned home, his worry-wart dad would have called me. He’s done it before.”\nAgain, Petit nodded, but he was nodding in such a way as not to confirm or deny what Steve was saying. Petit knew that Billy Friend was another of the group who stayed away from class since Friday.\n“Harrell had to have made it home. I know that is where he was heading because he called his parents before leaving. Since his parents were home, they would have reported him missing.\nPetit said, evenly, “So, you know it was Diana Scott who is missing.”\n“Yes, it’s got to be her. I suppose you know that she was in her dad’s car Thursday night.” Steve shuddered, “She always drives home around Lake Hefner. She is a short girl and Mr. Scott’s Caddy is huge. I bet she lost control on that dark and bumpy lake road.” More importantly, her parents were on vacation, so they would not have been there to report her missing.\nAFTERWARD\nWednesday morning, November 27. Mr. Scott’s Cadillac was hoisted out of a shallow inlet by the lake road running alongside. Diana’s dead body was slumped against the steering wheel. Apparently, she had been knocked unconscious when hitting the water. Lieutenant Petit was both saddened and relieved to find the body; relieved because this completed the search for Diana Scott before the Thanksgiving weekend began, saddened because he would have to inform her parents of the bad news and ruin their holiday.\nPetit noticed that the Cadillac’s dashboard clock was stopped at 11:10, fitting perfectly with what Steve Collier had told him. He would think often in the years to come that young Miss Petit died less than an hour before that fateful day of November 22, 1963, commenced at midnight.\n\nNOTE: While this story is a work of fiction, much of it is taken from a little known occurrence in Oklahoma City. On the evening of Thursday, November 21, 1963, a woman and her daughter left the home of friends to return to their home approximately five miles away. They were never seen or heard of again, until in the spring of 1990, when a small inlet off of Lake Hefner was drained and filled for an interstate highway project. The car and remains of the missing women were found in the lakebed, the dashboard clock indicating they had driven into the lake in late evening. The local police departments admitted that, had they not been so preoccupied with the Kennedy murder the next day, 200 miles south in Dallas, they would probably have been discovered the missing women much earlier. Known as the Elston case, this was, at the time of discovery, the oldest open case in the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation."
