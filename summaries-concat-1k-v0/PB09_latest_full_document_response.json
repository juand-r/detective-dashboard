    "text": "“MR. SPEAKER, sir,” said Mr. Mirabel, M.P., rising and raising his hat, “I beg to ask the Right Honourable the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as head of the Mint, the questions that stand in my name.”\nThese are the questions that stood in his name:—\n1. “Is the Right Hon. gentleman aware that there is a large and increasing quantity of unauthorised imitations of the silver coins of the realm in circulation in the United Kingdom?”\n2. “What steps, if any, have been taken to detect the coiner or coiners and withdraw such counterfeit coin from circulation?”\n3. “Is it true that these counterfeit coins are made from pure silver, and in view of this circumstance are the Government prepared to consider the adoption of the principle of bimetallism and free coinage of silver as the only effective preventive?”\nSir Robert Verdon, the handsome and portly Chancellor of the Exchequer, was plainly nettled by the questions. He showed no trace of his customary good-humour as he rose to reply.\n“Her Majesty’s Government,” he said, “have had their attention directed to the circumstances mentioned in the question of my honourable friend. They are taking active measures for the detection of the offender and the suppression of the offence. But it would not be for the interest of the public service to enter into further detail. In reply to the last paragraph of the question of my honourable friend, the Government are not prepared to propose bimetallism as the alternative to crime.”\nThere was a ripple of laughter below the gangway at the close of the answer; but the men on the front benches did not join in it. The matter under consideration was too serious. It was well known that a vast system of silver coinage, in which the Mint had no concern, was in process for the last three or four years. It was rumoured that the system had, by some mysterious process, extended over the Continent and even to America. But, as it subsequently transpired, even the initiated had but a faint conception of the extent of this gigantic fraud.\nAbout five years before, the persistent slump in silver had brought its price down to under two-and-six per ounce. The intrinsic value of the metal of the silver coins of the United Kingdom was therefore not quite half the face value guaranteed by the Government; in other words, there was less than sixpence worth of silver in a shilling, and so on with the rest.\nThis slump had, of course, the effect amongst silver owners of intensifying the outcry for bimetallism.\nBut it had another effect more serious. The bright notion struck some enterprising coiner to make false coin in pure silver. The cost of the metal was less than half the value of the coin, and as his workmanship and material were as good as the Mint, detection of the counterfeit was impossible.\nThe idea caught on and grew to a vast international system. The counterfeit silver coins slipped mysteriously into general circulation. No one questioned them—no one could question them. To call them “base coin” would be a clear misnomer. They differed from the genuine coinage only in their place of origin. So vast was the system that the increase of silver coinage and the consequent demand for the metal began to tell on the price of silver bullion. It rose gradually from half-a-crown to four shillings per ounce, though the rise was popularly attributed to other causes. Even financial experts never guessed how largely it was due to this practically free coinage of silver.\nNo wonder the Chancellor of the Exchequer was annoyed when Mr. Mirabel inconsiderately directed the attention of the House of Commons, and worse still, of the public, to this highly inconvenient and embarrassing question. All the same, he began to regret his curtness, after a bit. Mr. Mirabel, the millionaire banker, was one of the wealthiest, the most generous, the most hospitable, and the most popular man in the House of Commons. He seldom spoke, but always to the purpose, yet without that affectation of superior knowledge which is so irritating to the ignorant. He was a sound Liberal, and his vote and cheque-book were always at the service of the party. To crown all, he was an intimate personal friend of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Mirabel did not seem in the least disconcerted by the snub he had received. About half an hour later the division bell rang, and he was sauntering through the “No” lobby with a quizzical smile on his pleasant face, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer, coming behind, took his arm in a friendly way, and drew him into one of the recesses.\n“Didn’t think me rude, Mirabel, I trust?” he said. “The truth is we are terribly perplexed about this infernal business. Ordinary counterfeit coins, however good the die, are of course easily detected by the metal. But now even the experts cannot tell the difference.”\nHe took a handful of loose silver from his pocket, and jingled it in comic perplexity. “As like as not,” he went on, “one-half of these have never seen the Mint. I’ll be passing bad coin and defrauding the Exchequer when I pay for my dinner later on.”\nMirabel laughed. “So long, Sir Robert, as you will play the game of finance with counters instead of coin you will be liable to this danger. When you make the value of the metal equal to the face value of the coin you will spoil the clever coiner’s little game. You don’t find any private coiner operating in gold, for example.”\n“The remedy would be worse than the disease,” retorted Sir Robert, a little pettishly. “You cannot fix a state price for silver any more than you can fix a state price for bread. I always wondered how a shrewd chap like you, Mirabel, took up this fad of the bimetallists. Your theory, it seems to me, reduces itself into an absurdity. ‘Let’s call half-a-crown’s worth of silver three-and-six, and things will be all right.’ No, my friend, silver must take its chance with other commodities in the open market. I find it sometimes hard to believe you are serious in this craze.”\n“Serious! My clear Sir Robert, I am backing my opinion for all I’m worth in the world, and that’s a tolerably big stake. I’m engaged in what I suppose you would call ‘making a corner in silver.’ I believe in the future of the white metal, and I’m buying for a rise. The price is beginning to go up pretty quick, as you are aware “\n“Then this private coining hasn’t hurt you?”\n“In one sense, no. It is undoubtedly driving up the value of silver. Now, I bought most of my stock when it was at bottom prices—a mere drug in the market—and I could clear out, if I wanted to, at a big profit. But I don’t want to. I’m still buying, and the rise in price doesn’t suit me. I am not only on the deal here at home, but I have given my orders to my branch establishments in France, Germany, and America: ‘Buy what silver you can at market prices.’ I fancy I am the biggest owner of silver in the world at the present moment.”\n“But you are driving up the price on yourself by this wholesale purchase.”\n“That’s so, but it cannot be helped. I mean to sell out at a big profit when bimetallism arrives.”\n“It will never arrive.”\n“I’ll risk that. Meanwhile the price is growing, and I got the first five millions’ worth so cheap I can afford to pay a little extra for further supplies.”\n“Five millions! Surely you haven’t got five millions’ worth of silver, Mirabel?”\n“Nearer to seven millions, Sir Robert, by this time,” Mr. Mirabel replied coolly.\n“Door! Door!” shouted the impatient tellers at this moment. Mr. Mirabel and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to run for it, and they passed out amongst the last stragglers of the division into the passage at the back of the Speaker’s chair.\n“It’s incredible,” resumed the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a little out of breath, partly from the run, partly from amazement.\n“Come and see for yourself. The bank is worth seeing for its own sake. It was a big private house, you know, with the finest cellars in London. I board all my clerks there, and try and make them comfortable, and stay there myself as often as not. A bachelor, you see, can choose his own home. It’s a bit off the track, of course. I don’t care to pay a guinea a foot ground rent. But my customers don’t complain; men don’t mind trouble when they want money. Come over and lunch with me some day—any day that suits you—and I’ll show you over the big silver shop.”\n“Well, we’ll see about it.”\n“Say ‘yes’ and I think I can give you a helping hand with this coinage business.”\n“That’s a tempting bribe. Wait one moment.” Sir Robert stepped into the House through the entrance behind the Speaker’s chair, lurking in the shadow. “There’s nothing doing here,” he said when he came out the next moment. “Come to my room, Mirabel, and we’ll talk this over. You have no notion how important it is to us.”\n“Perhaps not,” Mr. Mirabel answered, as they walked down the long passage together; “but I know it is very important to me.”\n“Now tell me frankly,” said the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when they were alone in the room together with closed doors, “were you serious when you said you could help me to catch my coiner?”\n“I cannot myself, of course, but I think I might recommend you the man who can—a detective named Beck. The Scotland Yard chaps are babies to him, by all accounts.”\n“Beck! Beck! I think I’ve heard the name before. Why, that is the man the Duke of Southern talks so highly of!”\n“And the Duchess raves about; precisely.”\n“I’ve a good mind to try him. Do you know where he is to be had?”\n“He’s in the House at present, if he hasn’t left since the division. That’s what put his name into my head. I saw the placid face in the Strangers’ Gallery, when I got up to ask my question. Shall I send him to you?”\n“I will take it as a very great favour.”\n“All right. Mind that visit is booked,” and Mr. Mirabel started off in pursuit of Mr. Beck.\nFive minutes later Mr. Beck was closeted with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who rapidly explained what he wanted. “I don’t conceal from myself or you, Mr. Beck that it is a most difficult task. Scotland Yard has failed to find the slightest clue, though, of course, we have to put the best face on things for the public. The matter is of urgent Imperial importance, and expense is literally of no account whatever in comparison with success.”\n“I never bargain,” said Mr. Beck, “and I have never had any reason to complain. I’ll do my best for the work’s sake, and take my chance. This present case seems to me to resolve itself into two distinct parts. First: stop the coining. Second: catch the coiner. The first half appears simple enough if the people at the Mint will lend a hand.”\n“I will give you a letter to Mr. Moulton to assist you in every way. You’ll let me know from day to day how you get on. You might also communicate with Mr. Cecil Mirabel, M.P. He’s deeply interested in this matter and may be able to help you. You know Mr. Mirabel, of course?”\n“The Silver King! The biggest private banker in England! The man that is making the Rothschilds take a back seat. Yes, I know Mr. Mirabel.”\nMr. Moulton received Mr. Beck the next day at the Mint somewhat superciliously, but he thawed when he read the warm recommendation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n“Certainly, certainly, Mr. Beck,” he said, with as much cordiality as he could assume, but the long, thin hand he offered was limp, and the keen, cold eyes refused to have any part in his ungracious smile. “Certainly we will assist you in every way in our power.”\nHe would have questioned Mr. Beck, but the other, in a quiet, masterful way he could assume when the occasion required took the cross-examination into his own hands.\n“This rival manufacture has hurt your business?” he asked.\n“Somewhat—not as much as is thought, I should say. It has delayed the issue of silver coinage—that’s all.”\n“Are you going to have a new issue soon?”\n“Almost at once; dated the present year of course. It would create suspicion—perhaps panic—to delay it much longer.”\n“Can I see the ‘press room’?” asked Mr. Beck, a little abruptly.\n“Certainly; this way!”\nMr. Beck examined the row of huge coining presses with great care. The vast power of each of those big engines he saw was concentrated on the narrow point where the die touches the metal and gives it a new character to wear through the centuries.\nThen Mr. Moulton took one of the dies—a half-crown as it proved—from the steel girdle and handed it to Mr. Beck. “The coiner has the facsimile of this,” he said. “We cannot tell our own work from his.”\n“I think I have a plan,” said Mr. Beck musingly, “to help you in the future. It’s such a silly, simple plan, I’m half ashamed to mention it. But it ought to stop the coining, and perhaps catch the coiner. Couldn’t we have a little microscopic private mark on the die, say ‘M’ for Mint, there on the smooth part of the Queen’s neck. It should only be visible, of course, with a strong magnifying glass. The coiner could never suspect: new counterfeit coin could thus be detected at once. When the old coins are gradually called in ‘Othello’s occupation’s gone.’”\nMr. Moulton professed himself delighted at the suggestion. “I’ll see about it at once,” he said.\n“Do nothing hastily,” cautioned Mr. Beck; “above all, keep the secret tight. If you could have one half-crown—only one, mind—made for me with the new mark, as a specimen, by to-morrow, I would call in a few days with further instructions.”\nNext day Mr. Beck got his specimen and professed himself delighted with the masterly way his notion had been carried out. The little ‘M’ was quite invisible to the naked eye, and perfectly distinct under a strong glass.\nHe called straight-away to show it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but Sir Robert was not to be seen.\nBy sheer good luck, however, Mr. Beck caught Mr. Mirabel at the Reform Club. He took the “Silver King” aside, explained his plan to him, and showed him the specimen coin.\nMr. Mirabel was unaffectedly delighted. He chuckled over the ingenuity of the plan and congratulated Mr. Beck. “So this is the first coin of the new issue,” he said, as he examined it carefully through the strong glass Mr. Beck lent him. “It’s quite a curiosity in itself; I declare it will have a historic interest when the great conspiracy is exposed.”\n“You can keep it if you want to,” said Mr. Beck good-naturedly; “it is of no further use to me.”\n“Thanks,” said Mr. Mirabel, as he pocketed the half-crown.\nA few days later came the new issue of silver coinage from the Mint. There was a very limited application for supplies to the banks, so great was the glut of coined silver everywhere. Even Mr. Mirabel’s bank—the “Silver House,” as it was called—took only a very small consignment.\nThe same morning Mr. Beck walked briskly into the Bank and inquired for Mr. Mirabel. Mr. Mirabel was expected in about half an hour. While he waited Mr. Beck went to one of the compartments at the great circular counter of carved mahogany, and changed a five-pound Bank of England note.\n“Four sovereigns in gold, the rest in silver,” he said; “half-crowns if you have them.”\nThen he got away to a quiet corner and examined his eight half-crowns carefully through the strong magnifying glass.\n",

  "final_summary": "“The Slump in Silver” unfolds in a context of significant economic and political tension surrounding the integrity of the United Kingdom’s silver coinage. The story begins in the House of Commons, where Mr. Mirabel, a wealthy and influential Member of Parliament, publicly challenges the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Robert Verdon, with pointed questions about a widespread and alarming issue: the circulation of high-quality counterfeit silver coins within the United Kingdom. These coins, unlike typical counterfeit currency, are made from pure silver and are virtually indistinguishable from official mint issues, making detection nearly impossible even for experts.\n\nMr. Mirabel’s questions highlight three main concerns: awareness of an increasing volume of unauthorized silver coin imitations, measures taken by the government to detect and remove such counterfeit currency, and whether the government would consider bimetallism and free coinage of silver as a solution. Sir Robert’s response is terse and somewhat defensive; the government is aware and is actively trying to suppress the problem, but he dismisses the idea of bimetallism—a system that would recognize silver and gold as co-equal standards of value—as an inappropriate remedy for what he calls a “crime.”\n\nDespite the light laughter from some members of the Commons at the government’s dismissal of the bimetallism suggestion, the issue is serious and widespread. Unknown even to many insiders is the immense scale of this fraud, which has extended beyond Britain to the Continent and America. The crisis began several years earlier following a drastic slump in silver’s market price, reducing the intrinsic value of silver in coins to less than half their face value. This disparity inspired enterprising counterfeiters to produce coins from pure silver, allowing them to flood the market with high-grade fakes indistinguishable from genuine coinage.\n\nThe creation and circulation of these coins have influenced the silver market itself, paradoxically driving up silver’s value from a low point to nearly four shillings per ounce. This rise, however, is misunderstood by the public and most financial experts, who attribute it to other factors, unaware it stems largely from counterfeit production masquerading as legitimate coinage. This situation deeply annoys Sir Robert Verdon, who regrets the public airing of the issue but recognizes the complexity and sensitivity of capturing the coiner.\n\nMr. Mirabel emerges as a key figure in the narrative—not only for initiating the parliamentary challenge but also for his deep personal and financial involvement. Known as “the Silver King,” he is one of the richest and most influential bankers in the country, with extensive holdings in silver throughout Europe and America. He openly admits to speculating heavily in silver with the belief that its value will rise, betting on the eventual adoption of bimetallism. Ironically, while the counterfeiters’ activities inflate silver prices, this actually benefits Mirabel’s investments, though he laments the price inflation as it complicates his market strategy.\n\nThe story reveals the relationship between Mirabel and the Chancellor: despite initial tension, they engage in a candid and somewhat friendly discussion about the coinage crisis. The Chancellor confides his own frustrations, even humorously admitting he might unwittingly pass counterfeit coins himself. Mirabel’s financial strategies and extensive silver holdings bring a new dimension to the problem, showing how deeply the crisis permeates politics and economics.\n\nSeeking a solution, Sir Robert and Mirabel consider calling upon an extraordinarily skilled detective named Beck, renowned beyond Scotland Yard and endorsed by influential figures like the Duke and Duchess of Southern. Mr. Beck’s reputation for solving complex cases makes him an ideal candidate to tackle the sophisticated anti-forgery challenge presented by the counterfeit coins.\n\nWith the Chancellor’s formal backing, Mr. Beck approaches the Royal Mint and meets with Mr. Moulton, who oversees coin production. Moulton is initially reserved and somewhat dismissive toward Beck but soon acknowledges the gravity of the issue when presented with official support. Beck’s inspection of the Mint’s facilities reveals the high precision and power of the coining presses. Moulton also confirms that the counterfeiters have managed to create dies that perfectly replicate the Mint’s original designs, making detection by conventional means impossible.\n\nMr. Beck proposes a straightforward yet ingenious solution: the Mint should introduce a microscopic private mark on all new coins—an imperceptible letter “M” placed discreetly on the smooth part of the Queen’s neck, visible only under strong magnification. This would give the government a secret identifier to distinguish official coinage from counterfeit. Moulton welcomes the idea enthusiastically and arranges for prototype coins bearing the mark to be produced.\n\nWhen Beck shows the specimen coin to Mirabel, the banker is immediately impressed, recognizing the potential historical significance of the mark as a tool to expose the vast criminal conspiracy. The plan represents a turning point, providing a tangible means to control and eventually end the counterfeit coin epidemic.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Mint issues a limited run of new silver coins bearing the microscopic mark. Interestingly, demand for official silver remains low due to the overwhelming presence of silver coinage already in circulation, much of it counterfeit. Mr. Beck takes the opportunity to exchange currency at Mirabel’s bank, selecting several half-crowns to inspect carefully with his magnifying glass—signifying his active role in the ongoing investigation.\n\nIn summary, “The Slump in Silver” tells a compelling detective story intertwined with economic intrigue, political maneuvering, and advanced criminal forgery. The narrative centers on a covert scheme to undermine the nation’s silver currency through expertly made counterfeit coins of pure silver, challenging the authority of the Royal Mint and government financial policies. The characters—chiefly Mr. Mirabel, Sir Robert Verdon, and Mr. Beck—navigate this multifaceted crisis with a mix of financial acumen, political influence, and investigative skill. The story culminates in the ingenious tactical proposal to embed microscopic identifying marks on new coinage, a subtle but powerful countermeasure to halt and expose the counterfeiters. This solution promises to restore integrity to the currency and protect the nation’s financial stability, while also illustrating the complex interdependence of economics, crime, and governance in Victorian-era Britain.",
